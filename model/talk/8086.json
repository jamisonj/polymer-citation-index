It has never been just about the love and happiness of adults.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/why-marriage-why-family.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">The social science case for marriage and for families headed by a married man and woman is compelling.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote19-12455_000_021\">19<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[People may be loyal to one another in nonmarital relationships, and children can be born and raised, sometimes quite successfully, in other than a married two-parent family environment. But on average and in the majority of cases, evidence of the social benefits of marriage and of the comparatively superior outcomes for children in families headed by a married man and woman is extensive. On the other hand, the social and economic costs of what one commentator calls \u201cthe global flight from the family,\u201d weigh increasingly on society. Nicholas Eberstadt catalogs the worldwide declines in marriage and childbearing and the trends regarding fatherless homes and divorce and observes: \u201cThe deleterious impact on the hardly inconsequential numbers of children disadvantaged by the flight from the family is already plain enough. So too the damaging role of divorce and out-of-wedlock childbearing in exacerbating income disparities and wealth gaps\u2014for society as a whole, but especially for children. Yes, children are resilient and all that. But the flight from family most assuredly comes at the expense of the vulnerable young. That same flight also has unforgiving implications for the vulnerable old.\u201d (See \u201cThe Global Flight from the Family,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Wall Street Journal,<\/span> Feb.\u00a021, 2015, wsj.com\/articles\/nicholas-eberstadt-the-global-flight-from-the-family-1424476179.)]<\/span><\/sup> And so \u201cwe warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote20-12455_000_021\">20<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Nov. 2010, 129.]<\/span><\/sup> But our claims for the role of marriage and family rest not on social science but on the truth that they are God\u2019s creation.

Neither we nor any other mortal can alter this divine order of matrimony. It is not a human invention. Such marriage is indeed \u201cfrom above, from God\u201d and is as much a part of the plan of happiness as the Fall and the Atonement.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/why-marriage-why-family.p24\" class=\"\" id=\"p24\">In the premortal world, Lucifer rebelled against God and His plan, and his opposition only grows in intensity. He fights to discourage marriage and the formation of families, and where marriages and families are formed, he does what he can to disrupt them. He attacks everything that is sacred about human sexuality, tearing it from the context of marriage with a seemingly infinite array of immoral thoughts and acts. He seeks to convince men and women that marriage and family priorities can be ignored or abandoned, or at least made subservient to careers, other achievements, and the quest for self-fulfillment and individual autonomy. Certainly the adversary is pleased when parents neglect to teach and train their children to have faith in Christ and be spiritually born again. Brothers and sisters, many things are good, many are important, but only a few are essential.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/why-marriage-why-family.p25\" class=\"\" id=\"p25\">To declare the fundamental truths relative to marriage and family is not to overlook or diminish the sacrifices and successes of those for whom the ideal is not a present reality. Some of you are denied the blessing of marriage for reasons including a lack of viable prospects, same-sex attraction, physical or mental impairments, or simply a fear of failure that, for the moment at least, overshadows faith. Or you may have married, but that marriage ended, and you are left to manage alone what two together can barely sustain. Some of you who are married cannot bear children despite overwhelming desires and pleading prayers.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/why-marriage-why-family.p26\" class=\"\" id=\"p26\">Even so, everyone has gifts; everyone has talents; everyone can contribute to the unfolding of the divine plan in each generation. Much that is good, much that is essential\u2014even sometimes all that is necessary for now\u2014can be achieved in less than ideal circumstances. So many of you are doing your very best. And when you who bear the heaviest burdens of mortality stand up in defense of God\u2019s plan to exalt His children, we are all ready to march. With confidence we testify that the Atonement of Jesus Christ has anticipated and, in the end, will compensate all deprivation and loss for those who turn to Him. No one is predestined to receive less than all that the Father has for His children.<\/p>\n\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/why-marriage-why-family.p27\" class=\"\" id=\"p27\">One young mother recently confided to me her anxiety about being inadequate in this highest of callings. I felt that the issues that concerned her were small and she needn\u2019t worry; she was doing fine. But I knew she only wanted to please God and to honor His trust. I offered words of reassurance, and in my heart I pleaded that God, her Heavenly Father, would buoy her up with His love and the witness of His approval as she is about His work.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/why-marriage-why-family.p28\" class=\"\" id=\"p28\">That is my prayer for all of us today. May we each find approval in His sight. May marriages flourish and families prosper, and whether our lot is a fulness of these blessings in mortality or not, may the Lord\u2019s grace bring happiness now and faith in sure promises to come.

Our organization is such that we can resist the devil; if we were not organized so, we would not be free agents\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings: Joseph Smith,<\/span> 213).<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li><li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote14-12455_000_021\"><a name=\"14-12455_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t\t\t\t<a name=\"footnote14-12455_000_021\">14.<\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130603\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130603)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130603)\">Genesis 3:22\u201324<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130604\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130604)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130604)\">Alma 42:2\u20136<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130605\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130605)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130605)\">Moses 4:28\u201331<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li><li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote15-12455_000_021\"><a name=\"15-12455_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t\t\t\t<a name=\"footnote15-12455_000_021\">15.<\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<p>Even those who do not repent are redeemed from spiritual death by the Atonement in the sense that they come again into the presence of God for the Final Judgment (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130606\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130606)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130606)\">Helaman 14:17<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130607\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130607)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130607)\">3\u00a0Nephi 27:14\u201315<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li><li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote16-12455_000_021\"><a name=\"16-12455_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t\t\t\t<a name=\"footnote16-12455_000_021\">16.<\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings: Joseph Smith,<\/span> 210.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li><li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote17-12455_000_021\"><a name=\"17-12455_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t\t\t\t<a name=\"footnote17-12455_000_021\">17.<\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130608\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130608)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130608)\">Doctrine and Covenants 93:36\u201340<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li><li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote18-12455_000_021\"><a name=\"18-12455_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t\t\t\t<a name=\"footnote18-12455_000_021\">18.<\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"130609\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130609)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130609)\">Moses 6:58\u201359<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li><li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote19-12455_000_021\"><a name=\"19-12455_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t\t\t\t<a name=\"footnote19-12455_000_021\">19.<\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<p>People may be loyal to one another in nonmarital relationships, and children can be born and raised, sometimes quite successfully, in other than a married two-parent family environment. But on average and in the majority of cases, evidence of the social benefits of marriage and of the comparatively superior outcomes for children in families headed by a married man and woman is extensive. On the other hand, the social and economic costs of what one commentator calls \u201cthe global flight from the family,\u201d weigh increasingly on society. Nicholas Eberstadt catalogs the worldwide declines in marriage and childbearing and the trends regarding fatherless homes and divorce and observes: \u201cThe deleterious impact on the hardly inconsequential numbers of children disadvantaged by the flight from the family is already plain enough. So too the damaging role of divorce and out-of-wedlock childbearing in exacerbating income disparities and wealth gaps\u2014for society as a whole, but especially for children. Yes, children are resilient and all that. But the flight from family most assuredly comes at the expense of the vulnerable young. That same flight also has unforgiving implications for the vulnerable old.\u201d (See \u201cThe Global Flight from the Family,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Wall Street Journal,<\/span> Feb.\u00a021, 2015, wsj.com\/articles\/nicholas-eberstadt-the-global-flight-from-the-family-1424476179.)<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li><li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote20-12455_000_021\"><a name=\"20-12455_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t\t\t\t<a name=\"footnote20-12455_000_021\">20.<\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<p>\u201cThe Family: A Proclamation to the World,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Nov. 2010, 129.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li><li class=\"footnote \" id=\"footnote21-12455_000_021\"><a name=\"21-12455_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t\t\t\t<a name=\"footnote21-12455_000_021\">21.<\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130610\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130610)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130610)\">Genesis 1:26\u201328<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130611\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130611)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130611)\">2:7, 18, 21\u201324<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130612\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130612)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130612)\">3:20<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130613\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130613)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130613)\">Moses 2:26\u201328<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130614\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130614)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130614)\">3:7\u20138, 18, 20\u201324<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"130615\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130615)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130615)\">4:26<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/li> <\/ol><\/div>\n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
