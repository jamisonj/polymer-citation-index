McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1963, pp. 129-131<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nBrethren and Sisters, we are nearing the end of another great conference. I am impressed with\nthe thought that everyone who has attended, either in presence or by listening in, no matter\nwhere he or she may be, must leave this conference with a greater determination to be a\nbetter man or a better woman; a better citizen of the town, county, or nation than he or she\nhas ever been before.\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Bernard P. Brockbank has just said that it is good to be in the presence of good\npeople. He gave a sermon in that sentence. \"It is good to be in the presence of good people.\"\nEvery man and every person who lives in this world wields an influence, whether for good or\nfor evil. It is not what he says alone, it is not alone what he does. It is what he is. Every man,\nevery person radiates what he or she is. Every person is a recipient of radiation. The Savior\nwas conscious of that. Whenever he came into the presence of an individual, he sensed that\nradiation&mdash;whether it was the woman of Samaria with her past life\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28064\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28064)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28064)\">John 4:16-19<\/a><\/span>); whether it was the\nwoman who was to be stoned or the men who were to stone her\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28067\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28067)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28067)\">John 8:1-11<\/a><\/span>); whether it was the\nstatesman, Nicodemus (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28053\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28053)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28053)\">John 3:1,10<\/a><\/span>),\nor one of the lepers (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31597\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31597)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31597)\">Luke 17:15-19<\/a><\/span>).\nHe was conscious of the radiation from the\nindividual. And to a degree so are you, and so am I. It is what we are and what we radiate\nthat affects the people around us.\n<\/p><p>\nWe cannot go from this great conference without an added responsibility to contribute to a\nbetter life around us. As individuals, we must think nobler thoughts. We must not encourage\nvile thoughts or low aspirations. We shall radiate them if we do. If we think noble thoughts,\nif we encourage and cherish noble aspirations, there will be that radiation when we meet\npeople, especially when we associate with them.\n<\/p><p>\nThat is true of the individual. It is true of the home, as we have heard in this conference from\nBrother Gordon B. Hinckley. Our homes radiate what we are, and that radiation comes from\nwhat we say and how we act in the home. No member of this Church&mdash;husband,\nfather&mdash;has the right to utter an oath in his home or ever to express a cross word to his wife or to his\nchildren. You cannot do it as a man who holds the priesthood and be true to the spirit within\nyou by your ordination and your responsibility. You have to contribute to an ideal home by\nyour character, controlling your passion, your temper, guarding your speech, because those\nthings will make your home what it is and what it will radiate to the neighborhood.\n<\/p><p>\nI am reminded of a remark made by a man who came here and attended the board meeting of\nthe United States Steel Company in 1946. You will remember&mdash;some of you in this\naudience, some of you General Authorities will remember&mdash;that they invited\nus to attend a dinner of that board, and at the conclusion of that entertainment the chairman,\nthe master of ceremonies&mdash;I think it was Mr. Irving S. Olds&mdash;said: \"Now we are not going to\nhave any set speeches, but here is an opportunity if any of you would like to express\nyourselves.\"\n<\/p><p>\nMr. Nathan L. Miller, general counsel for that board, arose, and in substance said, \"I am one\nof those inquisitive, suspicious New Englanders, and I have been impressed with something in\nthis city that seems to be different from any other city I have ever visited.\" A radiation! He\ncontinued, \"I walked up and down Main Street and watched the people. There is something\nabout the city which is different from any other I have been in. I tried to define it and\nwondered what it was, but during an interview in the President's office today (President\nGeorge Albert Smith was their host then, and the board had invited him that morning) I think\nI discovered what it is.\" President George Albert Smith had called on some of the brethren to\nspeak to the visitors (United States Steel board members), who were sitting and standing\naround the First Presidency's board room in the Church Administration Building.\n<\/p><p>\nHe said, \"I listened to what these men said.\" One of them had referred to the pioneers and the\nspirit of the pioneers; that before they started out across the plains under the direction of\nPresident Young, they sought divine guidance first. Second, under his direction, they were\nprepared. Every man would carry a gun and must be prepared for an attack of savages or any\nother possible emergency that might come to the pioneers that day. And third, every man\nmust take just as much care of his neighbor's cattle as he did of his own.\n<i>Worship, Preparation, Service!<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nI do not know whether it was that that answered this gentleman's curiosity or not, but he said,\n\"I thought in that meeting in the President's office I detected what there is in the city which is\ndifferent&mdash;it is spirituality,\" said he. \"That's it! It is spirituality! The pioneers had it ! I am\nwondering if you younger men (he spoke to those around him) can keep that spirituality with\nthe installation of material things coming into your midst.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe was referring to that radiation of the group which we all feel. I repeat, every individual\nhas it. Every home radiates it, and every Latter-day Saint home should have it.\n<\/p><p>\nA father visited his son's new home. The son was proud to show him the new bedroom, the\nnew installations in the kitchen. After they were through with their visit, the father said, \"Yes,\nit is beautiful, but I see no signs of God in your home.\" And the son said, \"I went back, and\nas I looked through the rooms, I noticed I had nothing suggestive of the presence of the\nRedeemer or the Savior.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhat I am saying is, we leave this conference today with greater responsibility than ever\nbefore, as men of the priesthood, as women of the Church, to make our homes such as will\nradiate to our neighbors harmony, love, community duties, loyalty. Let our neighbors see it\nand hear it. Never must there be expressed in a Latter-day Saint home an oath, a\ncondemnatory term, an expression of anger or jealousy or hatred. Control it! Do not express\nit! You do what you can to produce peace and harmony, no matter what you may suffer.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior set us the example, always calm, always controlled, radiating something which\npeople could feel as they passed&mdash;the woman who touched his garment\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31588\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31588)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31588)\">Luke 8:43-48<\/a><\/span>). He felt something go\nfrom him, that radiation which is divine.\n<\/p><p>\nEach individual soul has it. That is you. The body is only the house in which you live. God\nhelp us to radiate strength, control, love, charity, which is another name for love,\nconsideration, best wishes for all human beings.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church is reaching out, radiating, not only by bodies and meetings, but now through the\nkindness of the radio owners, television owners, we have touched them from the center.\nListen to the people up in Alaska: \"Our sincere thanks for the spiritual uplift. Reception\nexcellent at both ends of this far north stake. Attendance at Anchorage, 89. Fifty prayers are\ncertainly with you. Alaska Stake President (Lloyd B. Owen).\" Fifty prayers!\nWhy, it is just radiating throughout the whole world.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us as members of the priesthood and as members of the Church to radiate faith in\nGod, love of humanity, service to his people wherever they are, I pray in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
