One evening, when my wife and I were away, our children\u2019s babysitter, intrigued by the prayer she heard them saying, asked them this question: \u201cBut what is the difference between your religion and mine?\u201d The reply from our eight-year-old daughter was immediate: \u201cIt\u2019s almost the same, except that we study a lot more than you do!\u201d Far from wanting to offend her babysitter, my little daughter just wanted to underline in her own way the importance that Latter-day Saints attach to the search for knowledge.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/even-a-child-can-understand.p6\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith declared, \u201cIt is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117693\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117693)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117693)\">D&amp;C 131:6<\/a><\/span>).

This knowledge is founded on understanding the nature of God and Jesus Christ and the plan of salvation that They have prepared to allow us to return to Their presence. \u201cAnd this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117323\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117323)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117323)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/even-a-child-can-understand.p7\" class=\"\">The principle of knowledge has often been misinterpreted by men. \u201cThe glory of God is intelligence\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117651\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117651)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117651)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>).

However, a child reading this book for the first time will have at least as much, if not more, chance to understand the doctrine as the majority of those doctors of the scriptures. The Savior\u2019s teachings are adapted to everyone. At eight years of age a child can have sufficient understanding to enter the waters of baptism and make a covenant with God with complete understanding.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/even-a-child-can-understand.p17\" class=\"\">What would a child understand from reading the story of the baptism of Jesus? Jesus was baptized in the river Jordan by John the Baptist.

In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Jacob denounced those in ancient times who \u201cdespised the words of plainness, and killed the prophets, and sought for things that they could not understand. Wherefore, because of their blindness, which blindness came by looking beyond the mark, they must needs fall; for God hath taken away his plainness from them, and delivered unto them many things which they cannot understand, because they desired it\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117431\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117431)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117431)\">Jacob 4:14<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/even-a-child-can-understand.p19\" class=\"\">Sometimes we may be tempted to think, \u201cIt\u2019s too easy,\u201d just like Naaman, the Syrian captain who, constrained by his pride, hesitated to obey the counsel of Elisha, which was too simple, in his eyes, to cure his leprosy.

After all, all the knowledge of the gospel which is meaningful for our salvation can be summarized in a few points of doctrine, principles, and essential commandments, which are already there in the missionary lessons we receive before baptism. Knowing God is a matter of opening our hearts to gain a spiritual understanding and a fervent testimony of the truth of these few fundamental points of doctrine. Knowing God is having a testimony of His existence and feeling in one\u2019s heart that He loves us. It is accepting Jesus Christ as our Savior and having a fervent desire to follow His example. In serving God and our neighbor, we witness of Christ and allow those around us to get to know Him better.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/even-a-child-can-understand.p31\" class=\"\">These principles find concrete application in the teaching which is given in our wards and branches.
