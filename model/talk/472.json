I have the high honor and\nprivilege of laboring with the youth of the Church; and it is a distinction and an honor to\nassociate with Bishop Richards and Bishop Isaacson, who have the welfare of the young\npeople at heart.\n<\/p><p>\nPAUL'S ADMONITION\n<\/p><p>\nThe admonition of the Apostle Paul to his younger associate Timothy is so applicable to\nyouth: \n<\/p><p>\nLet no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in\nconversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2805\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2805)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2805)\">1 Tim. 4:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThrough the great youth program of the Church, the admonition of Paul to Timothy is being\nadhered to. On every hand we see the evidence in the lives of these young people of their\nbelief, faith, charity, and purity.\n<\/p><p>\nFAITH OF YOUNG PEOPLE\n<\/p><p>\nSometime ago while I was visiting in the southern part of the state with Sister Wirthlin, we\ndecided to remain overnight at Bryce Canyon. We arrived in the afternoon, meeting some of\nthe young people who were employed there. They came to our cabin and held what I would\ncall a fireside chat. These young men and women told us of ambitions and objectives to be\nachieved and of their great faith in the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I remember one young\nman who told us that he came to Bryce Canyon with the hope of earning enough money to\npay his school expenses for the coming year. He was promised a certain salary, but later the\nmanager indicated that the salary could not be paid in the amount first mentioned. The young\nman was deeply worried, knowing that the income for the summer would not be adequate. He\nsaid he worried about it for several days and wondered whether or not he should seek\nemployment elsewhere.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Finally, one day,\" he declared, \"as I was driving out among the cedars to gather firewood for\nthe lodge, I said to myself, 'Why not ask the Lord about it?' So I stopped the truck and\nwalked out among the cedars, knelt down, and talked to my Heavenly Father. And there came\nto my heart a feeling of assurance that I should remain at Bryce Canyon and things would\nwork out. A few days later the manager came to me and said, 'We have decided to give you\nthe salary promised you in the first place.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nYou couldn't convince that young man that the Lord hadn't answered his prayer. He believed\nimplicitly in God, and because of that great faith he took his problem to the Lord and found\nthe solution.\n<\/p><p>\nThe next morning when we went to the lodge for our breakfast I noticed on the table the\nname of the waitress, an old familiar Latter-day Saint name. When the young lady came in, I\nasked her where she lived, and she answered, \"I live in Bountiful.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI asked, \"I suppose you are a member of this so-called Mormon Church?\"\n<\/p><p>\nShe replied, \"Yes, I am.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen I asked, \"What kind of church is it?\"\n<\/p><p>\nShe declared rather emphatically, \"It's a good church.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then I put the next question quite strongly and asked her if she thought it was the only\ntrue church (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12763\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12763)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12763)\">D&amp;C 1:30<\/a><\/span>).\nIn a very positive way she gave me to understand that it was the true church. At\nthat point Sister Wirthlin told the young lady who I was, and that ended it. But the thrill of\nthe whole thing was that this young woman, talking to a stranger, was willing to bear\ntestimony to the fact that she belongs to the restored Church of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nFAITH OF SERVICEMAN\n<\/p><p>\nSome four weeks ago I had a rather interesting and inspiring experience. A young man whom\nI have known since he was a boy came into my office. He said, \"I'm a reserve officer, and I\nhave been called into the army.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe had been married only about four or five years and has two lovely children, and I\nsorrowfully replied, \"Paul, I'm sorry, in a way.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe said, \"Brother Wirthlin, don't worry about me, I have come here this morning to get some\ntracts that I might do some missionary work among my companions in the army; and\nfurthermore, I have a promise, which I look upon as a divine promise, that I shall live to see\nthe day when my father, who is not a member of the Church, will join it. I'm so impressed\nwith that promise, I'm not worrying about the experiences that are immediately ahead of me.\"\nSuch faith&mdash;so simple, and so profound! This young man will enjoy the blessings of our\nHeavenly Father because of his sweet, clean life and his faith in the gospel of the Lord Jesus\nChrist, and in the priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nWe often hear young people bear their testimonies to the divinity of this great work, and what\na thrill it is; although, at times, there are evidences of a negative attitude on the part of older\npeople. They say these young people cannot stand up and testify that they know this is the\nChurch of God, that God lives, that Jesus is his Son, and that Joseph Smith was a true\nprophet. Brothers and sisters, young people, even a child at the age of eight who has been\nbaptized, can stand up under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and bear sincere testimony that\nhe knows the Heavenly Father lives, that Jesus is his Son, and that Joseph Smith was his\nchosen instrument. There is no question about that in my mind.\n<\/p><p>\nDAY OF PENTECOST\n<\/p><p>\nGo back to the days of Peter, the Apostle, after Christ had left the disciples, and they had\nreceived the Holy Ghost. They stood before a great multitude of people on the Day of\nPentecost and preached to them the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. The throng of people\nwere so pricked in their hearts that they arose as one man and asked, \". . . Men and brethren,\nwhat shall we do?\" Peter answered them and said,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the\nremission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\n<\/p><p>\nFor the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as\nmany as the Lord our God shall call\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7628\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7628)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7628)\">Acts 2:37-39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAny child who attains the right age, who has faith and repents of his sins and is baptized for\nthe remission of sin under the hands of authorized servants of God, can receive the gift of the\nHoly Ghost; and under the inspiration of that sweet spirit, he can bear his testimony. Did not\nthe Christ declare: \n<\/p><p>\nBut when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even\nthe Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father he shall testify of me\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27456\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27456)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27456)\">John 15:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSPIRIT OF TESTIMONY\n<\/p><p>\nI recall a friend of mine who had a great sorrow to bear. He had sought solace in many\nplaces. Finally, one fast Sunday he said to his wife, \"Let us go over to fast meeting.\" He\nhadn't been too active in the Church. In the fast meeting he saw many of the young people\nbearing their testimonies. The spirit of testimony took hold of him, and he stood up and bore\nhis testimony. That same afternoon he asked another associate of mine if he could have some\nplace in the activities of the Church, and he was called to serve. Today he is a loyal, devoted,\nand fruitful servant of our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, what about the young men who are being called into the armed forces of the nation?\nAfter all, we use this axiom: Old men for counsel and young men for battle. In the bloody\nstruggle of war, it is youth who suffer. Their blood is spilt; their lives are sacrificed; and\nmany are denied the blessings of having a companion and rearing a family. We owe much to\nthese young men. First, we owe them encouragement. We owe to them letters in a constant\nstream to keep them encouraged, to keep their faith built up. Then if death should come,\nbecause of their sweet, clean lives, they will regardless of what happens to them if death\nshould come, because of their sweet, clean lives, they will be able to meet the great Judge\nwho will extend his hand to them and give them that heavenly salutation: \"Well done, thou\ngood and faithful servant\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34383\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34383)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34383)\">Matt. 25:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAARONIC PRIESTHOOD PROGRAM\n<\/p><p>\nThe Aaronic Priesthood program of the Church is most vital. It is a training field for the\nyoung men of the Church. And what a grand and glorious thing it is to know that a boy at the\ntender age of twelve can receive divine authority from on high and become a servant of God.\nWhenever I think of these twelve-year-old boys, I always think of another one who lived\nnearly two thousand years ago&mdash;the boy Savior of the world, Jesus Christ. At the age of\ntwelve we find him attending the Feast of the Passover with his parents in\nthe city of Jerusalem, and in the course of events he found his way to the temple. There he\nwas discussing the problems of the day with the great, the wise, and the learned. Later his\nmother missed him, and in looking for him, found him in the temple. In effect, she said to\nhim, \"Do you not know that you have caused your father and me a good deal of sorrow and\ngrief?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31254\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31254)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31254)\">Luke 2:48<\/a><\/span>).\nThen he gave her that memorable answer, \". . . wist ye not that I must be about my\nFather's business?\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31255\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31255)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31255)\">Luke 2:49<\/a><\/span>).\nThat should be the slogan of the Aaronic Priesthood, in\nwhich every boy at the age of twelve commences his ministry in the Church of Jesus Christ\nof Latter-day Saints. The Aaronic Priesthood affords opportunities that young boys cannot\nafford to miss, if they will take advantage of them; just as Paul said to Timothy,\n<\/p><p>\nLet no man despise thy youth: but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in\nconversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2806\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2806)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2806)\">1 Tim. 4:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAUXILIARY ORGANIZATIONS\n<\/p><p>\nThen, too, we have the great auxiliary organizations of the Church. We have the Sunday\nSchool which provides lessons covering the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ; we have the\nYoung Men's Mutual Improvement Association and the Young Women's Mutual\nImprovement Association. We have our seminaries and institutes. We have our great welfare\nprogram, too, which should play a pertinent part in training our youth to be thrifty, ambitious,\nand willing to sustain themselves by the sweat of their brows and the toil of their hands. The\nPrimary Association of the Church makes a great contribution in the spiritual, vocational, and\nrecreational training of our children. It is the Primary that takes the child at a tender age and\nguides his footsteps in the paths of prayer and faith; and it teaches him how to use his hands\neffectively. The Primary Association is closely related to the young men who become holders\nof the Aaronic Priesthood, as it provides a preparatory course for all young men of the\nChurch who anticipate receiving the Aaronic Priesthood. May I say, emphatically, the Primary\nAssociation has been one of the great factors in giving young men a vision of their\nresponsibilities in the future. May God always bless and sustain the fine sisters who have been\nand who are carrying on this splendid work.\n<\/p><p>\nBOY SCOUT PROGRAM\n<\/p><p>\nAnother great and very important project of which little is said is that of the Boy Scout\nprogram. I want to say to you, as the vocational and recreational program of the Church for\nthe Aaronic Priesthood, there is nothing finer than scouting. I say this because I have three\nsons, two of them are Eagle Scouts, and the other one a Life Scout. As I\nhave observed their work in scouting, to me it has been almost comparable to a college\neducation. Many times there are those of us who feel scouting is strictly a recreational\nprogram, but that is only a part of it. We are faced today with a big problem in knowing what\nto do with the leisure time of our boys, especially during the vacation period. The scouting\nprogram will take up all of this leisure time, provided we encourage our boys to participate in\nit.\n<\/p><p>\nAbout a year ago a Scout was sent to me for an oral examination covering the project of\nproducing beef. I asked many questions of the scout pertaining to the production of beef, and\nI was quite surprised when he answered every one of them correctly. With the knowledge he\nhas accumulated through the merit badge project in scouting, he will be able to go forward in\nthe beef industry on his own, although he is tender in years.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many other projects which can be most helpful to young men in working out their\nfuture vocations.\n<\/p><p>\nAs a father of three sons, and all of them Scouts, if I were to choose someone to supervise\ntheir recreation, I would choose the scouters of my own ward, because I know they would be\nin good hands and nothing would happen that would be detrimental to their character.\n<\/p><p>\nWhere we have the right kind of Aaronic Priesthood work, we will have the great scouting\nprogram supplementing it; and where there is good scouting, there is good Aaronic Priesthood\nwork. I plead with you to support the Boy Scouts.\n<\/p><p>\nMISSIONARIES\n<\/p><p>\nI haven't forgotten the 5800 young men and young women out in the world, meeting people\nfar beyond them in age and experience. With the sword of truth in their hands for defense and\noffense, they are convincing men they have a great message, and as a result thousands of\npeople are accepting the gospel of Jesus Christ in this nation and all over the world.\n<\/p><p>\nSUPPORT OF YOUTH\n<\/p><p>\nSo, we plead for your support, for your help in encouraging the youth of the Church to\nparticipate in the great Church youth program, with the aim that they may be prepared when\nthe time comes to take over the responsibilities that we older people now have. Returning to\nPaul's admonition to Timothy, \"Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the\nbelievers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2807\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2807)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2807)\">1 Tim. 4:12<\/a><\/span>). Impress every\nyoung man with his responsibilities and obligations in the priesthood, that when temptation\ncrosses his path, he may remember the answer of the boy Savior in the temple when he said,\n\" . . . wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31256\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31256)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31256)\">Luke 2:49<\/a><\/span>). This I humbly\npray, will be the blessing of every young man and every young woman in the Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
