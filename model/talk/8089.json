Helaman must have known and respected this about his brother, for he gave Shiblon custody of the sacred records he had received from his father.

But callings come and go. Even more impressive to me are the many who without formal callings find ways to consistently serve and lift others. One brother shows up early for church to set up chairs and stays after to straighten up the chapel. One sister purposely selects a seat near a blind sister in her ward not only so she can greet her but also so she can sing the hymns loudly enough that the blind sister can hear the words and sing along. If you look closely in your ward or branch, you will find examples like these. There are always members who seem to know who needs help and when to offer it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/truly-good-and-without-guile.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">Perhaps my first lesson about truly good Saints without guile was learned when I was a young missionary. I moved into an area with an elder I didn\u2019t know. I had heard other missionaries talk about how he had never received any leadership assignments and how he struggled with the Korean language despite having been in the country a long time. But as I got to know this elder, I found he was one of the most obedient and faithful missionaries I had known. He studied when it was time to study; he worked when it was time to work. He left the apartment on time and returned on time. He was diligent in studying Korean even though the language was especially difficult for him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/truly-good-and-without-guile.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">When I realized the comments I had heard were untrue, I felt like this missionary was being misjudged as unsuccessful. I wanted to tell the whole mission what I had discovered about this elder. I shared with my mission president my desire to correct this misunderstanding. His response was, \u201cHeavenly Father knows this young man is a successful missionary, and so do I.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd now you know too, so who else really matters?\u201d This wise mission president taught me what was important in service, and it wasn\u2019t praise, position, power, honor, or authority. This was a great lesson for a young missionary who was too focused on titles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/truly-good-and-without-guile.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">With this lesson in mind, I began to look back on my life and see how often I had been influenced by men and women who at the time held no great title or position. One of those Shiblon-like souls was my seminary teacher during my junior year in high school. This good man taught seminary for only two or three years, but he opened my heart in a way that helped me gain a testimony. He may not have been the most popular teacher at the school, but he was always prepared and his influence on me was powerful and lasting. One of the few times I saw this man in the 40 years since he taught me was when he came to see me at my father\u2019s funeral. Truly, that was an act not motivated by title or power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/truly-good-and-without-guile.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">I honor that dedicated teacher and many like him who are truly good and without guile. I honor the Sunday School teacher who doesn\u2019t teach his students just during class on Sunday but also teaches and influences these same students by inviting them to join his family for breakfast. I honor youth leaders who attend the sporting and cultural activities of the young men and young women in their wards. I honor the man who writes notes of encouragement to neighbors and the woman who doesn\u2019t just mail Christmas cards but hand delivers them to family members and friends who need a visit. I honor the brother who routinely took a neighbor for a ride during that neighbor\u2019s dark days of Alzheimer\u2019s\u2014giving both him and his wife a much-needed change of pace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/truly-good-and-without-guile.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">These things are not done for praise or accolades. These men and women are not motivated by the possibility of receiving titles or authority. They are disciples of Christ, going about doing good continually, and like Shiblon, they are trying to please their Father in Heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/truly-good-and-without-guile.p22\" class=\"\" id=\"p22\">It saddens me when I hear of some who stop serving or even attending church because they are released from a calling or feel overlooked for a position or title. I hope they will one day learn the same lesson I learned as a young missionary\u2014that the service that counts most is usually recognized by God alone. In our pursuit of me and mine, have we forgotten Thee and Thine?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-afternoon-session\/truly-good-and-without-guile.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">Some may say, \u201cBut I have so far to go to become like those you describe.\u201d The good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that the desires of our hearts can be transformed and our motives can be educated and refined.

The plan of salvation is marked by covenants. We promise to obey commandments. In return, God promises blessings in this life and for eternity. He is exact in what he requires, and he is perfect in keeping his word. Because he loves us and because the purpose of the plan is to become like him, he requires exactness of us. And the promises he makes to us always include the power to grow in our capacity to keep covenants. He makes it possible for us to know his rules. When we try with all our hearts to meet his standards, he gives us the companionship of the Holy Ghost. That in turn both increases our power to keep commitments and to discern what is good and true.

The plan of salvation is marked by covenants. We promise to obey commandments. In return, God promises blessings in this life and for eternity. He is exact in what he requires, and he is perfect in keeping his word. Because he loves us and because the purpose of the plan is to become like him, he requires exactness of us. And the promises he makes to us always include the power to grow in our capacity to keep covenants. He makes it possible for us to know his rules. When we try with all our hearts to meet his standards, he gives us the companionship of the Holy Ghost. That in turn both increases our power to keep commitments and to discern what is good and true. And that is the power to learn, both in our temporal studies and in the learning we need for eternity\u201d (Henry\u00a0B.
