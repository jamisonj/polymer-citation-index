I use them as a basis for something I wish to say particularly to the youth and young adults of the Church, many thousands of whom are joined with us in this great world conference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p5\" class=\"\">A few weeks ago I looked into the faces of a huge fireside congregation who had gathered on a Sunday evening on the campus of Brigham Young University. I was told there were about eighteen thousand in attendance. They were bright-eyed and attentive. They were eager and alert. They gave their undivided attention, and when the meeting was over they were generous in their expressions of appreciation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p6\" class=\"\">A few months before that I met with students of the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Southern California, who gathered in our institute building in Los Angeles. Most of these are involved in graduate studies. They are in a challenging and wonderful season of their lives, concerned with great and serious undertakings. I have no doubt they will become leaders in their chosen disciplines. But they are also young men and women with faith who gathered that Sunday to listen and learn of the things of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p7\" class=\"\">Within the past month I have met with other comparable groups in Spain and Italy, in Switzerland and Denmark. In each place they were clean, neatly dressed, with an eagerness that was wonderful and infectious. It mattered not that they spoke a different language from mine and that they live in a different part of the world. They are partakers of the same gospel of Jesus Christ with a tremendous understanding of that gospel and a deep and abiding sense of gratitude for it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p8\" class=\"\">Then two weeks ago, I was in southern Utah on the campus of Southern Utah University. Sprinkled all through that congregation were young men and women, many of whom are enrolled in that school and who again reflect in their appearance and manner something that is wholesome and uplifting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p9\" class=\"\">These are some of our young people of whom I am proud and concerning whom I have a great sense of gratitude and a compelling sense of optimism. In saying this, I do not wish to infer that all is well with all of them. There are many who have troubles, and many who live far beneath the high expectations we have concerning them. There are also those who waver in their faith and who are troubled and frustrated within themselves. There are some, I regret to say, who step over the line of acceptable moral behavior and suffer great tragedies in their lives. But even considering these, I have great confidence in our young people as a whole. I regard you as the finest generation in the history of the Church. I compliment you, and I have in my heart a great feeling of love and respect and appreciation for you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p10\" class=\"\">Each time I have stood before such a group, there has come into my mind the great and prophetic statement made by Peter of old. Said he: \u201cYe are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2431\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2431)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2431)\">1 Pet. 2:9<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p11\" class=\"\">I know of no other statement which more aptly describes you, nor which sets before you a higher ideal by which to shape and guide your lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p12\" class=\"\">Some time ago I read a letter to a newspaper editor which was highly critical of the Church. I have forgotten the exact language, but it included a question something like this: \u201cWhen are the Mormons going to stop being different and become a part of the mainstream of America?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p13\" class=\"\">About this same time there came to my desk a copy of an address given by Senator Dan Coats of Indiana. He spoke of a study made by \u201ca commission of educational, political, medical and business leaders\u201d dealing with the problems of American youth. The committee issued a report called <span class=\"emphasis\">Code Blue. <\/span>That report, according to the Senator, concluded: \u201cNever before has one generation of American teenagers been less healthy, less cared for, or less prepared for life than their parents were at the same age.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p14\" class=\"\">He went on to say, \u201cI have seen the parade of pathologies\u2014they are unending and increasing:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cSuicide is now the second leading cause of death among adolescents, increasing 300 percent since 1950.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cTeen pregnancy has risen 621 percent since 1940. More than a million teenage girls get pregnant each year. Eighty-five percent of teenage boys who impregnate teenage girls eventually abandon them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cThe teen homicide rate has increased 232 percent since 1950.

A third of high school seniors get drunk once a week. The average age for first-time drug use is now thirteen years old.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p19\" class=\"\">The report reached a shocking conclusion. It said: \u201cThe challenges to the health and well-being of America\u2019s youth are not primarily rooted in illness or economics. Unlike the past, the problem is not childhood disease or unsanitary slums. The most basic cause of suffering \u2026 is profoundly self-destructive <span class=\"emphasis\">behavior. <\/span>Drinking. Drugs. Violence. Promiscuity. A crisis of behavior and belief. A crisis of character.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Imprimis, <\/span>Sept. 1991, p. 1.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p20\" class=\"\">When I read those statements, I said to myself, If that is the mainstream of American youth, then I want to do all in my power to persuade and encourage our young people to stay away from it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p21\" class=\"\">Now I know, as do you, that there are millions of young people in this nation and in every nation who live wholesome, good lives and who are ambitious to make something of themselves. But no one can blink at the fact that in this land, and in other lands across the world, there is an epidemic affecting the lives of millions of youth. It is a sickness that comes of a loss of values, of an abandonment of moral absolutes. The virus which has infected them comes of leaderless families, leaderless schools, leaderless communities. It comes of an attitude that says, \u201cWe will not teach moral values. We will leave the determination of such to the individual.\u201d Parents, in all too many cases, have abdicated their responsibility to \u201ctrain up a child in the way he should go\u201d so that \u201cwhen he is old, he will not depart from it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41632\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41632)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41632)\">Prov. 22:6<\/a><\/span>.) Educators in all too many cases have adopted an attitude of moral neutrality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p22\" class=\"\">Many public officers have abandoned any reverent use of the name of God in public meetings, thereby closing the door to Deity when it is plainly evident there is a need for wisdom beyond their own.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p23\" class=\"\">If we deny the one sure source of moral truth, then from whence will it come?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p24\" class=\"\">Lately we have been following in our papers the trial of a group of young men in New York City who attacked a family from Provo, Utah, to rob them to get money to go to a discotheque. A son in that family, in trying to defend his mother, was killed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p25\" class=\"\">I do not pretend to know all of the facts. But if what I have read is true, that tragedy finds its roots in the absence of a proper set of values implanted in the lives of those young men. They are now faced with tragic consequences, the spending of years in prison.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p26\" class=\"\">In a recent year more than four hundred youth were killed in Los Angeles by other young people, in many instances the result of gang warfare.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p27\" class=\"\">And so I might continue with a picture familiar to all of you, but I return to Peter\u2019s great statement as I make a plea and offer a challenge: \u201cYe are a chosen generation.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2432\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2432)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2432)\">1 Pet. 2:9<\/a><\/span>] How very true that is. Notwithstanding all of the problems that we have, this, I believe, is the greatest age in the history of the world. And you young people of this generation are a part of it.

Its fruits are here to bless your lives if you will grasp them and live worthy of them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/a-chosen-generation.p28\" class=\"\">We today enjoy more of comfort, more of opportunity, more of the blessings of science and research than any generation in the history of the earth. We live longer to enjoy these things. When I was born, the life expectancy in the United States was fifty years. Today it is seventy-five-plus years. It is difficult for me to believe that during the seemingly short time I have lived, the average life expectancy in this nation has increased by a quarter of a century. There has been more of scientific discovery in my lifetime than in all the previous years of the history of mankind. I do not know why I has been so blessed as to have been born in this favored season. But I am grateful, profoundly grateful.
