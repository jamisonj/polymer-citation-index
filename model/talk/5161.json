I would prefer a private setting to discuss this sensitive subject and ask that the Holy Spirit help us both that you may receive the relief of the Lord from the cruelty that has scarred your life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p5\" class=\"\">Unless healed by the Lord, mental, physical, or sexual abuse can cause you serious, enduring consequences. As a victim you have experienced some of them. They include fear, depression, guilt, self-hatred, destruction of self-esteem, and alienation from normal human relationships. When aggravated by continued abuse, powerful emotions of rebellion, anger, and hatred are generated. These feelings often are focused against oneself, others, life itself, and even Heavenly Father. Frustrated efforts to fight back can degenerate into drug abuse, immorality, abandonment of home, and, tragically in extreme cases, suicide. Unless corrected, these feelings lead to despondent lives, discordant marriages, and even the transition from victim to abuser. One awful result is a deepening lack of trust in others which becomes a barrier to healing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p6\" class=\"\">To be helped, you must understand some things about eternal law. Your abuse results from another\u2019s unrighteous attack on your freedom. Since all of Father in Heaven\u2019s children enjoy agency, there can be some who choose willfully to violate the commandments and harm you. Such acts temporarily restrict your freedom. In justice, and to compensate, the Lord has provided a way for you to overcome the destructive results of others\u2019 acts against your will. That relief comes by applying eternal truths with priesthood assistance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p7\" class=\"\">Know that the wicked choice of others cannot completely destroy your agency unless you permit it. Their acts may cause pain, anguish, even physical harm, but they cannot destroy your eternal possibilities in this brief but crucial life on earth. You must understand that <span class=\"emphasis\">you are free to determine to overcome the harmful results of abuse. <\/span>Your attitude can control the change for good in your life. It allows you to have the help the Lord intends you to receive. No one can take away your ultimate opportunities when you understand and live eternal law. The laws of your Heavenly Father and the atonement of the Lord have made it possible that you will not be robbed of the opportunities which come to the children of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p8\" class=\"\">You may feel threatened by one who is in a position of power or control over you. You may feel trapped and see no escape. Please believe that <span class=\"emphasis\">your Heavenly Father does not want you to be held captive by unrighteous influence, by threats of reprisal, or by fear of repercussion to the family member who abuses you. <\/span>Trust that the Lord will lead you to a solution. Ask in faith, nothing doubting.

Perhaps you distrust others and feel that there is no reliable help anywhere. Begin with your Eternal Father and his beloved Son, your Savior. Strive to comprehend their commandments and follow them. They will lead you to others who will strengthen and encourage you. There is available to you a priesthood leader, normally a bishop, at times a member of the stake presidency. They can build a bridge to greater understanding and healing. Joseph Smith taught: \u201cA man can do nothing for himself unless God direct him in the right way; and the Priesthood is for that purpose.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, <\/span>p. 364.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p12\" class=\"\">Talk to your bishop in confidence. His calling allows him to act as an instrument of the Lord in your behalf. He can provide a doctrinal foundation to guide you to recovery. An understanding and application of eternal law will provide the healing you require. He has the right to be inspired of the Lord in your behalf. He can use the priesthood to bless you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p13\" class=\"\">Your bishop can help you identify trustworthy friends to support you.

He is the consummate healer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p17\" class=\"\">Gain trust in the love and compassion of your elder brother, Jesus Christ, by pondering the scriptures.

That use of your agency allows divine intervention. When you permit it, the love of the Savior will soften your heart, break the cycle of abuse that can transform a victim into an aggressor. Adversity, even when caused willfully by others\u2019 unrestrained appetite, can be a source of growth when viewed from the perspective of eternal principle. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"19718\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19718)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19718)\">D&amp;C 122:7<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p19\" class=\"\">The victim must do all in his or her power to stop the abuse. Most often, the victim is innocent because of being disabled by fear or the power or authority of the offender. At some point in time, however, the Lord may prompt a victim to recognize a degree of responsibility for abuse. Your priesthood leader will help assess your responsibility so that, if needed, it can be addressed. Otherwise the seeds of guilt will remain and sprout into bitter fruit. Yet no matter what degree of responsibility, from absolutely none to increasing consent, the healing power of the atonement of Jesus Christ can provide a complete cure. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"19727\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19727)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19727)\">D&amp;C 138:1\u20134<\/a><\/span>.) Forgiveness can be obtained for all involved in abuse. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"7022\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7022)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7022)\">A of F 1:3<\/a><\/span>.) Then comes a restoration of self-respect, self-worth, and a renewal of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p20\" class=\"\">As a victim, do not waste effort in revenge or retribution against your aggressor. Focus on your responsibility to do what is in your power to correct. Leave the handling of the offender to civil and Church authorities. Whatever they do, eventually the guilty will face the Perfect Judge. Ultimately the unrepentant abuser will be punished by a just God. The purveyors of filth and harmful substances who knowingly incite others to acts of violence and depravation and those who promote a climate of permissiveness and corruption will be sentenced. Predators who victimize the innocent and justify their own corrupted life by enticing others to adopt their depraved ways will be held accountable.

He does not always understand the importance of the treatment prescribed, but his obedience speeds recovery. So it is with you struggling to heal the scars of abuse. Forgiveness, for example, can be hard to understand, even more difficult to give. <span class=\"emphasis\">Begin by withholding judgment. <\/span>You don\u2019t know what abusers may have suffered as victims when innocent. The way to repentance must be kept open for them. Leave the handling of aggressors to others. As you experience an easing of your own pain, full forgiveness will come more easily.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p25\" class=\"\">You cannot erase what has been done, but you can forgive.

Forgiveness heals terrible, tragic wounds, for it allows the love of God to purge your heart and mind of the poison of hate. It cleanses your consciousness of the desire for revenge.

They are: Excessive probing into every minute detail of your past experiences, particularly when this involves penetrating dialogue in group discussion; and blaming the abuser for every difficulty in your life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p31\" class=\"\">While some discovery is vital to the healing process, the almost morbid probing into details of past acts, long buried and mercifully forgotten, can be shattering. There is no need to pick at healing wounds to open them and cause them to fester. The Lord and his teachings can help you without destroying self-respect.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p32\" class=\"\">There is another danger. Detailed leading questions that probe your past may unwittingly trigger thoughts that are more imagination or fantasy than reality. They could lead to condemnation of another for acts that were not committed. While likely few in number, I know of cases where such therapy has caused great injustice to the innocent from unwittingly stimulated accusations that were later proven false. Memory, particularly adult memory of childhood experiences, is fallible. Remember, false accusation is also a sin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p33\" class=\"\">Stated more simply, if someone intentionally poured a bucket of filth on your carpet, would you invite the neighbors to determine each ingredient that contributed to the ugly stain?

There must be sufficient discussion of the general nature of abuse to allow you to be given appropriate counsel and to prevent the aggressor from committing more violence. Then, with the help of the Lord, bury the past.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/05\/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse.p35\" class=\"\">I humbly testify that what I have told you is true.
