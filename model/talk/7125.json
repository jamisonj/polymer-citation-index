If you ever find yourself in its presence\u2014which can happen to anyone in the world in which we live\u2014follow the example of Joseph of Egypt.

Parents install alarms to warn if their household is threatened by smoke or carbon monoxide. We should also install protections against spiritual threats, protections like filters on Internet connections and locating access so others can see what is being viewed. And we should build the spiritual strength of our families by loving relationships, family prayer, and scripture study.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/pornography.p48\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Finally,<\/span> do not patronize pornography. Do not use your purchasing power to support moral degradation.
