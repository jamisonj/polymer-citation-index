This is a delightful extension of our family life which we celebrate and love and which the world is beginning to recognize as a basic family pattern\u2014to have fathers and sons together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p4\" class=\"\">We are grateful to have you present, and our appreciation for you is great and our affection sincere.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p5\" class=\"\">First, may we commend you for your devotion and faithfulness. The temples are generally full. The chapels are filling, and there is an increase in attendance and devotion. The families holding home evening are increasing, and we are happy with the display of faith and love which is manifested throughout the Church. We are particularly happy with the growth in numbers and effective activity in the stakes and missions overseas.

The First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve have approved the organization of an elders quorum in every ward and independent branch. The elders, regardless of number, up to 96, residing in a particular ward or independent branch, may be constituted as an elders quorum, with a presidency. Where there are more than 96 elders, the quorum should be divided. It is felt by the Brethren that this great reservoir of power and strength can best be used to its greatest value to have strong, active quorums of elders in the more local jurisdictions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p7\" class=\"\">Another priesthood item: Effective immediately, stake presidents may ordain seventies and set apart presidents of seventy in their stakes when such men have been properly processed and approved by the First Council of the Seventy.

Enlarging this answer we say: Certainly every male member of the Church <span class=\"underline\">should<\/span> fill a mission, like he <span class=\"underline\">should<\/span> pay his tithing, like he <span class=\"underline\">should<\/span> attend his meetings, like he <span class=\"underline\">should<\/span> keep his life clean and free from the ugliness of the world and plan a celestial marriage in the temple of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p15\" class=\"\">While there is no compulsion for him to do any of these things, he <span class=\"underline\">should<\/span> do them for his own good.

When I heard a Church leader from Salt Lake City tell us at conference that we should read the scriptures, and I recognized that I had never read the Bible, that very night at the conclusion of that very sermon I walked to my home a block away and climbed up in my little attic room in the top of the house and lighted a little coal-oil lamp that was on the little table, and I read the first chapters of Genesis. A year later I closed the Bible, having read every chapter in that big and glorious book.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p39\" class=\"\">I found that this Bible that I was reading had in it 66 books, and then I was nearly dissuaded when I found that it had in it 1,189 chapters, and then I also found that it had 1,519 pages.

I had seen people chewing tobacco, and it was repulsive to me. I had seen men waste much time in \u201crolling their own\u201d cigarettes. They would buy a sack of \u201cBull Durham\u201d tobacco or some other brand and then some papers, and then they would stop numerous times in a day to fill the paper with tobacco and then roll it and then bend over the little end of it and then smoke it. It seemed foolish to me and seemed such a waste of time and energy. Later when the practice became more sophisticated, they bought their cigarettes readymade.

And so I made up my mind firmly and solidly that I would never touch those harmful things. Having made up my mind fully and unequivocably, I found it not too difficult to keep the promise to myself and to my Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p48\" class=\"\">I remember once in later years when I was district governor of the Rotary Clubs of Arizona that I went to Nice, France, to the international convention.

Seven glass goblets were filled at every plate. The drinks were colorful. I was a long way from home; I knew many of the district governors; they knew me. But they probably did not know my religion nor of my stand on the Word of Wisdom. At any rate, the evil one seemed to whisper to me, \u201cThis is your chance. You are thousands of miles from home. There is no one here to watch you. No one will ever know if you drink the contents of those goblets. This is your chance!\u201d And then a sweeter spirit seemed to whisper, \u201cYou have a covenant with yourself; you promised yourself you would never do it; and with your Heavenly Father you made a covenant, and you have gone these years without breaking it, and you would be stupid to break this covenant after all these years.\u201d Suffice it to say that when I got up from the table an hour later, the seven goblets were still full of colorful material that had been poured into them but never touched an hour earlier.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p50\" class=\"\">Again, my young brethren, in my boyhood I remember one time when the sheriff startled us when he came and announced that under the floorboards of the porch of the home just up the street from where we lived they had found a considerable cache of stolen articles.

As we moved around in the home, a young boy came to me and said, \u201cBrother Kimball, I\u2019m thinking about a mission. Would you give me a blessing?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p56\" class=\"\">I said, \u201cWhy, of course. I\u2019d be very happy to give you a blessing, but isn\u2019t that your father I met in the other room?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p57\" class=\"\">He said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s Dad.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p58\" class=\"\">I said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you ask him to give you your blessing?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p59\" class=\"\">\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cDad wouldn\u2019t want to give a blessing to me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p60\" class=\"\">So I excused myself. In time I ran into the father, and I said, \u201cYou have a wonderful boy there. I think he would like to have a blessing from his father. Wouldn\u2019t you like to give him a blessing?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p61\" class=\"\">He said, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think my boy would want me to give him a blessing.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p62\" class=\"\">But as I mingled among these people and saw the father and the son a little later, close together, I could understand that they had come together in their thoughts and that the boy was proud to have his father bless him, and the father was delighted to be asked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p63\" class=\"\">I hope you boys in this audience will keep that in mind. You have the best dad in the world, you know. He holds the priesthood; he would be delighted to give you a blessing. He would like you to indicate it, and we would like you fathers to remember that your boys are a little timid maybe. They know you are the best men in the world, but probably if you just made the advance, there would be some glorious moments for you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life.p64\" class=\"\">Brethren, it is wonderful to be with you here tonight. And may peace be with you, and as has been said so many times in these days, only righteousness pays dividends. God bless you, and I bear my testimony to you boys, to you men, that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. It is a great program of salvation and exaltation, and it is the only way, and there never was found happiness in unrighteousness. I bear my testimony to you in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
