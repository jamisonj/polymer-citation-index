Callis, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1945, pp. 80-83<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nAs I witnessed that impressive vote sustaining the General Authorities of the Church, a Latin\nphrase came to my mind which runs as follows: \"The voice of the people is the voice of\nGod.\" While this does not hold strictly true in all cases, yet yesterday morning the voice of\nGod was heard in this great tabernacle. It is a wonderful thing, a blessing of comfort that we\nhave the more sure word of prophecy in this Church. In fact this Church is the treasure house\nof all the gifts of God, and gives the knowledge that will make men eligible for entrance into\nthe celestial kingdom of God. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a universal\nChurch; it is not only a worldwide Church, but it is as wide as eternity.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE DAWNING OF A NEW ERA\n<\/p><p>\nThe prophet Isaiah&mdash;and of this prophet, Jesus said that his words were\ngreat (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5453\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5453)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5453)\">3 Ne. 23:1<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;had\na vision so glorious and splendid that in heavenly rapture he exclaimed:\n<\/p><p>\nWho hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring\nforth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once?\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25028\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25028)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25028)\">Isa. 66:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe are on the threshold of remarkable events. If God, centuries ago, could incline the hearts\nof the people to seek him so that they had no disposition to do evil\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40199\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40199)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40199)\">Mosiah 5:2<\/a><\/span>), why cannot he do that\ntoday? The inhabitants of the earth are his children, and God loves mercy more than\njudgment. I believe that we are entering upon an era of conversion so great that the human\nmind cannot conceive its magnitude. We are told in holy writ that every knee must bow and\nevery tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41227\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41227)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41227)\">Philip. 2:10-11<\/a><\/span>).\nWith all my heart I believe that divine prediction\nwill come true, for Jesus Christ is the King of kings and the Lord of lords\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42172\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42172)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42172)\">Rev. 19:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE APPEARANCE OF JESUS TO THE JEWS\n<\/p><p>\nOrson Pratt and Charles W. Penrose declared that prior to the glorious coming of the Son of\nGod, the Jews are going to be beleaguered by the nations who threaten the very existence of\nthe Jewish race. Then, according to Zechariah, down through the gates of heaven shall come\nthe Lord Jesus Christ, the Captain and King for whom the Jews have wept and prayed so\nlong, and he shall set his feet upon the Mount of Olives, and the Mount shall cleave asunder,\nand the Jews shall escape destruction (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43065\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43065)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43065)\">Zech. 14:4-5<\/a><\/span>).\nThe God of heaven shall then, with the armies of\nheaven, have judgment upon the wicked, and the wicked shall be destroyed. When Jesus\nstands before the Jews, they will see the wounds in his hands and, recognizing their Lord and\nGod, they shall say: \". . . What are these wounds in thine hands?\" And then Jesus shall break\nthe hearts of the Jews by saying: \"Those with which I was wounded in the house of my\nfriends\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43064\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43064)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43064)\">Zech. 13:6<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd that nation then, and not until then, shall be born in a day\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25029\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25029)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25029)\">Isa. 66:8<\/a><\/span>). By\nthe authorized servants of God they shall receive the baptism of repentance; they shall receive\nthe gift of the Holy Ghost, and become the children of God their Father and the servants of\nthe great Jehovah. At that time a fountain shall be opened up unto the Jews and the\ninhabitants of Jerusalem (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43063\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43063)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43063)\">Zech. 13:1<\/a><\/span>),\na fountain for the cleansing of sin and iniquity, and that fountain\nshall be as it always has been, the Lord Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nWe read in the Book of Mormon:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in. . .\nour hearts, . . . we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40200\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40200)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40200)\">Mosiah 5:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE DESTINY OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS\n<\/p><p>\nAnd if the elders of Israel will preach the gospel in its plainness, not worldly philosophy, but\nthe gospel of faith, repentance, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, and the laying\non of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, then shall the hearts of the people be changed by\nthe almighty power of God and they will press into the kingdom of God. This Church is\ndestined to evangelize the whole earth. That is its mission, and by the grace of God we are\ngoing to accomplish it.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a wonderful prophecy in First Nephi, fourteenth chapter, uttered about the time that\nIsaiah delivered his great prophecy. Listen to it:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended\nupon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who\nwere scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and\nwith the power of God in great glory\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1461\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1461)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1461)\">1 Ne. 14:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHow rapidly this wonderful prophecy is being fulfilled! President Joseph F. Smith in Bern,\nSwitzerland, declared that \"there will be churches built here [that is, in Europe], and temples\nbuilt here and there all over Europe.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a glorious destiny God sent us here to perform. Brethren and sisters, how can we be\ndilatory, how can we be negligent, when, shining as the sun in heaven, is the purpose and the\ndestiny of this people? A people that has not an ideal or a noble purpose is like a painted ship\non a painted ocean, but we must cherish and nourish these wonderful ideals that God has\ngiven and press on to the mark of eternal perfection. And the elders in the field ought not to\nbe kept coddling the Saints, but they should be sent out among the Gentiles and derive that\nstrength and power which comes from preaching the everlasting gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nRIGHTEOUSNESS REQUIRED TO MAKE A MIGHTY NATION\n<\/p><p>\nGod be praised for this mighty republic! Oh, if the leaders of this\nnation could realize the purpose for which this nation is created, a might nation, the greatest\nin the world, that stands preeminent among\nall the nations, I believe that they would highly resolve in their hearts that corruption,\nextravagance, infidelity, Sabbath-breaking, and all the evils which form the accursed things in\nthis nation, would be removed. I believe that this nation would then receive such a mighty\nuplift that it would be the wonder of all the world, that it would go forth assisting God and\nJesus in establishing the religion which can bring permanent and perpetual peace and lasting\nglory to this nation.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren and sisters, let us go forward. We are trying to awaken the world for the conflict of\njustice, preaching the gospel as a special witness for the second coming of the Son of God.\nStanding in the front ranks of this battle, we shall know, we do know now, that we are\nbattling for the Lord through rendering service for our fellow creatures.\n<\/p><p>\n\"O God, our help in ages past, our hope for years to come,\" be thou our guide we pray thee,\nlead us on to victory in this great spiritual battle. May we be thy humble instruments in\nbringing repentance into the world and salvation to our fellow beings, we humbly pray in the\nname of Jesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
