Through the miracle of life, we planted the seeds and produced delicious fresh peas, corn, carrots, turnips, onions, and potatoes from our own garden. I clearly remember a most meaningful experience when my grandfather showed us how to sow alfalfa seeds by hand. He had plowed and harrowed the ground to prepare the seedbed. Then he took a handful of seeds, and with a wide swing of his arm he artfully scattered them as he paced across the field in geometric patterns. Although birds ate some of the alfalfa seed, the crop grew, and the stand was rich and plentiful for many years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/of-seeds-and-soils.p6\" class=\"\">This experience helped me later, as a missionary, to understand the Savior\u2019s parable of the sower, which is actually a parable about different kinds of soil.

The Savior also explained the meaning of the parable. The seed that \u201cfell by the way side\u201d represents those who hear the word of God but do not understand it and fall into the clutches of Satan. The second seed, which \u201cfell upon stony places,\u201d describes those who joyfully hear the word and thrive as long as all goes well. But when trials come and they feel peer pressure because of their beliefs, they are offended and do not endure. The third seed, which \u201cfell among thorns,\u201d represents those who hear the word, but worldliness and riches are more important to them, and they fall away from the truth. The last seed, however, which \u201cfell into good ground,\u201d represents those who hear the word, understand it, live it, and reap great eternal rewards.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-99911_000_021\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"37837\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37837)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37837)\">Matt. 13:19\u201323<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/of-seeds-and-soils.p12\" class=\"\">The Book of Mormon provides several examples of seed that fell by the wayside.

We meet wonderful, stalwart members of the Church who are faithful and dedicated. Some of us who have sown seeds as missionaries may have felt that those seeds fell on hard ground. It is not always possible to know the consequences of one single contact. For years William R. Wagstaff, who served in the North Central States Mission from 1928 to 1930, felt disappointed he had not baptized more people.

The miracles of modern technology have brought efficiency into our lives in ways not dreamed of a generation ago, yet with this new technology has come a deluge of new challenges to our morals and our values. Some tend to rely more on technology than on theology. I hasten to add that scientific knowledge, the marvels of communication, and the wonders of modern medicine have come from the Lord to enhance His work throughout the world. As an example, the Church\u2019s FamilySearch\u00ae Web site has more than seven million hits a day. But Satan, of course, is aware of this great progress in technology and likewise takes advantage of it for his purposes, which are to destroy and despoil. He delights in the pornography on the Internet and the sleaze in many of our movies and television shows. He has even engineered some of his own satanic messages into some of our modern music. For the seeds of faith to sprout in our lives, we must avoid Satan\u2019s grasp.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/of-seeds-and-soils.p30\" class=\"\">We also need to prepare our own seedbed of faith. To do this we need to plow the soil through daily humble prayer, asking for strength and forgiveness. We need to harrow the soil by overcoming our feelings of pride. We need to prepare the seedbed by keeping the commandments to the best of our ability. We need to be honest with the Lord in the payment of our tithing and our other offerings. We need to be worthy and able to call forth the great powers of the priesthood to bless ourselves, our families, and others for whom we have responsibility. There is no better place for the spiritual seeds of our faith to be nurtured than within the hallowed sanctuaries of our temples and in our homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/of-seeds-and-soils.p31\" class=\"\">You young men of the Aaronic Priesthood should strive very diligently to acquire a skill and as much education as possible. You deacons and teachers do not have to determine your ultimate careers, yet you do need to lay the groundwork in preparation to meet life\u2019s challenges and ultimately to provide for your future wives and families. In a way, young men who do not awaken early to their God-given talents and possibilities are not fully honoring their priesthood. I know that in some parts of the world this is a most difficult challenge, but opportunities for you young men will be enhanced if you will learn well a basic skill. It would benefit you young men if you would also learn another language.
