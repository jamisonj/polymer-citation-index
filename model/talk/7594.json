It is the only Sabbath meeting the entire family can attend together. Its content in addition to the sacrament should always be planned and presented to focus our attention on the Atonement and teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/sacrament-meeting-and-the-sacrament.p12\" class=\"\">My first memories of sacrament meeting are set in the small Utah town where I was ordained a deacon and participated in passing the sacrament. Measured against those memories, the sacrament meetings I now attend in many different wards are greatly improved. Typically the sacrament is administered, passed, and received by the members in an atmosphere of quiet reverence. The conducting of the meeting, including the necessary business, is brief and dignified, and the talks are spiritual in content and delivery. The music is appropriate, and so are the prayers. This is the standard, and it represents great progress since the experiences of my youth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/sacrament-meeting-and-the-sacrament.p13\" class=\"\">There are occasional exceptions. I sense that some in the rising generation and even some adults have not yet come to understand the significance of this meeting and the importance of individual reverence and worship in it. The things I feel impressed to teach here are addressed to those who are not yet understanding and practicing these important principles and not yet enjoying the promised spiritual blessings of always having His guiding Spirit to be with them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>II.<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/sacrament-meeting-and-the-sacrament.p15\" class=\"\">I begin with how members of the Church should prepare themselves to participate in the ordinance of the sacrament. In a worldwide leadership training meeting five years ago, Elder Russell\u00a0M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught the priesthood leaders of the Church how to plan and conduct sacrament meetings. \u201cWe commemorate His Atonement in a very personal way,\u201d Elder Nelson said. \u201cWe bring a broken heart and a contrite spirit to our sacrament meeting. It is the highlight of our Sabbath-day observance\u201d (\u201cWorshiping at Sacrament Meeting,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Aug. 2004, 12; <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Aug. 2004, 26).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/sacrament-meeting-and-the-sacrament.p16\" class=\"\">We are seated well before the meeting begins. \u201cDuring that quiet interval, prelude music is subdued. This is not a time for conversation or transmission of messages but a period of prayerful meditation as leaders and members prepare spiritually for the sacrament\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Aug. 2004, 13; <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Aug. 2004, 27).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/sacrament-meeting-and-the-sacrament.p17\" class=\"\">When the Savior appeared to the Nephites following His Resurrection, He taught them that they should stop the practice of sacrifice by the shedding of blood. Instead, \u201cye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117501\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117501)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117501)\">3\u00a0Nephi 9:20<\/a><\/span>). That commandment, repeated in the modern revelation directing us to partake of the sacrament each week, tells us how we should prepare. As Elder Nelson taught, \u201cEach member of the Church bears responsibility for the spiritual enrichment that can come from a sacrament meeting\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Aug. 2004, 14; <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Aug. 2004, 28).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/sacrament-meeting-and-the-sacrament.p18\" class=\"\">In his writings on the doctrines of salvation, President Joseph Fielding Smith teaches that we partake of the sacrament as our part of commemorating the Savior\u2019s death and sufferings for the redemption of the world. This ordinance was introduced so that we can renew our covenants to serve Him, to obey Him, and to always remember Him. President Smith adds: \u201cWe cannot retain the Spirit of the Lord if we do not consistently comply with this commandment\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Doctrines of Salvation,<\/span> comp. Bruce\u00a0R. McConkie, 3\u00a0vols.

If we are going swimming or hiking or playing on the beach, our clothing, including our footwear, will indicate this. The same should be true of how we dress when we are to participate in the ordinance of the sacrament. It is like going to the temple. Our manner of dress indicates the degree to which we understand and honor the ordinance in which we will participate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/sacrament-meeting-and-the-sacrament.p21\" class=\"\">During sacrament meeting\u2014and especially during the sacrament service\u2014we should concentrate on worship and refrain from all other activities, especially from behavior that could interfere with the worship of others. Even a person who slips into quiet slumber does not interfere with others. Sacrament meeting is not a time for reading books or magazines. Young people, it is not a time for whispered conversations on cell phones or for texting persons at other locations. When we partake of the sacrament, we make a sacred covenant that we will always remember the Savior. How sad to see persons obviously violating that covenant in the very meeting where they are making it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/sacrament-meeting-and-the-sacrament.p22\" class=\"\">The music of sacrament meeting is a vital part of our worship. The scriptures teach that the song of the righteous is a prayer unto the Lord (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"117586\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117586)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117586)\">D&amp;C 25:12<\/a><\/span>). The First Presidency has declared that \u201csome of the greatest sermons are preached by the singing of hymns\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> ix). How wonderful when every person in attendance joins in the worship of singing\u2014especially in the hymn that helps us prepare to partake of the sacrament. All sacrament meeting music requires careful planning, always remembering that this music is for worship, not for performance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/sacrament-meeting-and-the-sacrament.p23\" class=\"\">President Joseph Fielding Smith taught: \u201cThis is an occasion when <span class=\"emphasis\">the gospel should be presented,<\/span> when <span class=\"emphasis\">we should be called upon to exercise faith,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">to reflect on the mission of our Redeemer,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">to spend time in the consideration of the saving principles of the gospel,<\/span> and not for other purposes. Amusement, laughter, light-mindedness, are all out of place in the sacrament meetings of the Latter-day Saints. We should assemble in the spirit of prayer, of meekness, with devotion in our hearts\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Doctrines of Salvation,<\/span> 2:342).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/sacrament-meeting-and-the-sacrament.p24\" class=\"\">When we do this\u2014when we join in the solemnity that should always accompany the ordinance of the sacrament and the worship of this meeting\u2014we are qualified for the companionship and revelation of the Spirit.

I love President Thomas\u00a0S.

Since most of our current deacons were not even born when these words were last spoken here, I repeat them for their benefit and that of their parents and teachers: \u201cMay I suggest that wherever possible a white shirt be worn by the deacons, teachers, and priests who handle the sacrament. For sacred ordinances in the Church we often use ceremonial clothing, and a white shirt could be seen as a gentle reminder of the white clothing you wore in the baptismal font and an anticipation of the white shirt you will soon wear into the temple and onto your missions\u201d (\u201cThis Do in Remembrance of Me,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1995, 68).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/sacrament-meeting-and-the-sacrament.p37\" class=\"\">Finally, the sacrament is administered only when authorized by the one holding the keys to this priesthood ordinance.
