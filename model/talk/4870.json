Blessings were given, prayers were offered. The spirit of his fellow missionaries soared. Their hearts were full. They lived closer to God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-little-child-shall-lead-them.p66\" class=\"\">Elder Wilson\u2019s physical condition deteriorated. The end drew near. He was to return home. He asked to serve but one additional month. What a month this was! Like a child trusting implicitly its parents, Elder Wilson put his trust in God. He whom Thomas Michael Wilson silently trusted opened the windows of heaven and abundantly blessed him. His parents, Willie and Julia Wilson, and his brother Tony came to Salt Lake City to help their son and brother home to Alabama. However, there was yet a prayed-for, a yearned-for, blessing to be bestowed. The family invited me to come with them to the Jordan River Temple, where those sacred ordinances which bind families for eternity, as well as for time, were performed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-little-child-shall-lead-them.p67\" class=\"\">I said good-bye to the Wilson family. I can see Elder Wilson yet as he thanked me for being with him and his loved ones. He said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what happens to us in this life as long as we have the gospel of Jesus Christ and live it.\u201d What courage. What confidence. What love. The Wilson family made the long trek home to Lafayette, where Elder Thomas Michael Wilson slipped from here to eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-little-child-shall-lead-them.p68\" class=\"\">President Kevin K. Meadows, Elder Wilson\u2019s branch president, presided at the funeral services. The words of his subsequent letter to me I share with you today: \u201cOn the day of the funeral, I took the family aside and expressed to them, President Monson, the sentiments you sent to me. I reminded them of what Elder Wilson had told you that day in the temple, that it did not matter whether he taught the gospel on this or the other side of the veil, so long as he could teach the gospel. I gave to them the inspiration you provided from the writings of President Joseph F. Smith\u2014that Elder Wilson had completed his earthly mission and that he, as all \u2018faithful elders of this dispensation, when they depart from mortal life, continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel of repentance and redemption, through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son of God, among those who are in darkness and under the bondage of sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead\u2019 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"19361\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 19361)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(19361)\">D&amp;C 138:57<\/a><\/span>]. The spirit bore record that this was the case. Elder Thomas Michael Wilson was buried with his missionary name tag in place.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-little-child-shall-lead-them.p69\" class=\"\">When Elder Wilson\u2019s mother and his father visit that rural cemetery and place flowers of remembrance on the grave of their son, I feel certain they will remember the day he was born, the pride they felt, and the genuine joy that was theirs. This tiny child they will remember became the mighty man who later brought to them the opportunity to achieve celestial glory. Perhaps on these pilgrimages, when emotions are close to the surface and tears cannot be restrained, they will again thank God for their missionary son, who never lost the faith of a child, and then ponder deep within their hearts the Master\u2019s words, \u201cAnd a little child shall lead them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25672\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25672)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25672)\">Isa. 11:6<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/a-little-child-shall-lead-them.p70\" class=\"\">Peace will then be their blessing. It will be our blessing, also, as we remember and follow the Prince of Peace. That we may do so is my sincere prayer. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
