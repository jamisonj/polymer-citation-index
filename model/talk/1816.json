It is the plan of salvation. It is that Christ hath abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.

It is a voice of joy and gladness and thanksgiving; of glory and honor; of immortality and eternal life. And it is destined to make of this earth, a heaven; and of man, a god.\n<\/p><p>\nKnown to the apostles and prophets of old, this glorious message was first revealed in modern times to the Prophet Joseph Smith and has since been planted in the hearts of all the true servants of the Lord by the revelation of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Proclaim saving truths<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so now, obedient to the divine command, we proclaim the saving truths of the gospel, not in the spirit of contention or debate, but by way of announcement, of exhortation, and of testimony.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are bold to say that there is a God in heaven, an infinite and holy being who is our Eternal Father and whose offspring we are in the spirit; that he ordained the plan of salvation whereby we, his spirit children, might advance and progress and become like him; that he chose his First-born in the spirit to be the Savior and Redeemer in his great plan of salvation; and that ever thereafter, to honor its chief advocate and exponent, this plan of salvation has been known as the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Salvation in Christ<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe testify that according to the terms and conditions of God's eternal plan, salvation is in Christ. He is the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world whose blood atoneth for the sins of all those who believe in his name.

We accept him as the Son of God, as the Savior and Redeemer of the world. We are grateful that he has seen fit to add to the canon of holy scripture, revealing anew, with a plainness and perfection which surpass the record of old, those things which men must do to be justified through faith in him and to work out their salvation with fear and trembling before him.

The world today has the record of part of what the saints of old possessed.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The gospel restored again<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nBut thanks be to God, we have the gospel, with all its saving power, restored again. God has given us the same doctrines, the same keys, and also the same powers possessed by those of old. All these things have been dispensed anew in this final, glorious gospel dispensation.\n<\/p><p>\nI shall call your attention to three heavenly visions which are part of this restoration of the gospel:\n<\/p><p>\nFirst: In the spring of 1820, Joseph Smith sought wisdom from God. In the providences of the Lord, he then received one of the most marvelous visions of all time, which he recorded in these words:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other&mdash;<i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!<\/i>\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30525\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30525)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30525)\">JS&mdash;H 1:16-17<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nSecond: Nearly twelve years later, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon \"beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father,\" together with a great concourse of \"holy angels,\" and recorded their testimony in these words:\n<\/p><p>\n\"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!\n<\/p><p>\n\"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15573\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15573)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15573)\">D&amp;C 76:20-23<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nThird: In April 1836, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery saw the Lord of heaven, of which this is the scriptural account:\n<\/p><p>\n\"The veil was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding were opened.\n<\/p><p>\n\"We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber.\n<\/p><p>\n\"His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah, saying:\n<\/p><p>\n\"I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15636\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15636)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15636)\">D&amp;C 110:1-4<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Visions real and true<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nNow, as servants of the Lord, we announce and testify that these three visions were as real and true as any ever received by any prophet in any age.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is no room for contention or debate. We are not quoting the Bible to prove what happened any more than Peter turned to the writings of Isaiah to prove he had felt the nail marks in the hands and feet of the risen Lord. We are saying with words of soberness that men in our day have heard the voice of God and seen the visions of eternity, and that the power of God whereby salvation comes is once more held by living apostles and prophets.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd all men everywhere have exactly the same obligation to heed and believe our testimony as men had in former days to accept the witness of the prophets of old.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Knowledge by personal revelation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe issue in Peter's day was: Did Christ rise from the dead? If so, he was the Son of God, and the religion of the ancient saints had saving power. To prove their message, the Lord's ancient servants reasoned out of the scriptures and bore testimony of what they knew by personal revelation.\n<\/p><p>\nThe issue today is: Was Joseph Smith called of God? If so, the religion of the Latter-day Saints has saving power. And to prove our message, like our brethren of old, we reason out of the scriptures and bear testimony of what we know by personal revelation.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so we testify that the Holy Ghost certifies to us that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God; that Joseph Smith is the great latter-day prophet through whom the knowledge of Christ and of salvation was restored; and that this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is in very deed the kingdom of God on earth, the one place where men may come to find peace in this life and become inheritors of eternal glory in the life to come.

And of that message we now testify that as our Lord and our God liveth, it is true.
