There is much evidence that there are those who still do not understand or at least do not take seriously the counsel that has been given for many years. It appears that some have the notion that the Church will care for them regardless of what they have done for themselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-church-and-the-family-in-welfare-services.p6\" class=\"\">We simply must recognize that the foundation of the Welfare Services program of the Church rests on the degree of preparedness of the individual and family to take care of themselves.

They also help other members with social, emotional, and economic problems as they live the second great commandment of loving their neighbor as themselves. In addition, they help the Church meet the needs of the poor through contributing a generous fast offering each month. These efforts, however, are geared to care for only a limited number of Saints, only those who genuinely cannot care for themselves\u2014the widow, the orphan, the temporarily unemployed, the emotionally distressed, the sick, and so forth. But even these are helped only after they and their families have done as much as they can for themselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-church-and-the-family-in-welfare-services.p19\" class=\"\">A year ago in this Welfare Services meeting, President Marion G.

Let me share the panorama of conditions that could befall each of us individually and the Church collectively. I would like you to see what might happen under three hypothetical but potentially real conditions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-church-and-the-family-in-welfare-services.p24\" class=\"\">Condition One is characterized by a relatively stable economy, modest unemployment, and only limited natural disasters\u2014a condition much like that which we now experience in this and many other countries. Only a small number of families or individuals in the Church would need to call upon their bishops for temporary health, emotional, or economic assistance. For those families or individuals unable to fully care for themselves, we would use our production projects, storehouses, employment efforts, and fast offering funds to help meet their needs. Appropriate health and social services capabilities of the Church would support the priesthood in administering to these special needs. Our present state of Church preparedness allows us to meet the claims on the Church which Condition One seems to imply.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-church-and-the-family-in-welfare-services.p25\" class=\"\">Condition Two is characterized by more serious health, social, and economic stress. This could include a depressed economy with serious unemployment, or perhaps localized natural disasters. Society would be unstable and disunited. In order for the Church to meet the needs of those who could not care for themselves, we would be required to produce the maximum from our production projects, reduce the variety of items produced and distributed, provide broad-scale work opportunities, and organize special quorum relief efforts. Health and social services would be needed in many places. Clearly, the material resources of the Church would be taxed heavily to meet this burden, particularly if Condition Two lasted very long or were very widespread.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-church-and-the-family-in-welfare-services.p26\" class=\"\">Under Condition Three, circumstances would be very serious. The economy would be very depressed, perhaps even suffering a near breakdown. Unemployment would be widespread. There would probably be widespread social disunity. This condition could be the result of either economic problems such as severe crop loss, broad-scale natural disasters, or possibly international conflict. <span class=\"emphasis\">Under such circumstances, the Church, relying on its present resources, would very likely not be able to provide any more assistance than that rendered under Condition Two, and therefore could not meet the total welfare needs of the people.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-church-and-the-family-in-welfare-services.p27\" class=\"\">If we were to place these three conditions on a progressive scale and estimate only the commodity cost to the Church during each condition, it would be approximately $25 million at the extremes of Condition One, approximately $95 million per year under Condition Two, and as much as $600 million under Condition Three. The sobering fact is, brothers and sisters, that presently the productive capacity from which we could distribute commodities to needy families and individuals is about $45 million. Therefore, if the time comes that we move out of Condition One into a widespread Condition-Two situation, we are well beyond the current capacity of the Church alone to meet the temporal needs of the Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-church-and-the-family-in-welfare-services.p28\" class=\"\">I would like to stress that this preparedness includes more than temporal preparedness. Particularly in Conditions Two and Three we would encounter social disunity, worry, fear, depression, and all the emotional stresses that accompany such economic and social conditions. Health conditions would be precarious. Families and individuals would need to be prepared emotionally and physically to weather this condition. Members would have greater need than every to rely on each other for strength and support.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-church-and-the-family-in-welfare-services.p29\" class=\"\">These examples and figures, though only projections, illustrate quite graphically that our temporal salvation will come only in following the counsel of the Brethren to be prepared as families and individuals, as wards and as stakes.
