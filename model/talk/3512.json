I think it is time we are thinking about these fundamentals because these are the days that lie ahead, when we are going to need more and more the blessings of the Lord, when the judgments are poured out without mixture upon the whole earth.\u201d (\u201cListen and Obey,\u201d Welfare Agricultural Meeting, 3 April 1971, copy of typescript, p. 14; Church Historical Library.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/fast-offerings-fulfilling-our-responsibility-to-others.p13\" class=\"\">President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., had this to say: \u201cThe fundamental principle of all Church relief work is that it must be carried on by fast offerings and other voluntary donations and contributions. This is the order established by the Lord. Tithing is not primarily designed for that purpose and must not be used except in the last extremity.\u201d (As quoted by Marion G. Romney, \u201cOur Primary Purpose,\u201d Welfare Agricultural Meeting, 3 April 1971, copy of typescript, p. 8; Church Historical Library.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/fast-offerings-fulfilling-our-responsibility-to-others.p14\" class=\"\">Fast offering is the Lord\u2019s financial law given for the blessing of the poor. For many years it was understood that fast offerings should represent the cost of the two meals not eaten. This understanding came into being because, in the early days, members were generally asked to give the actual food saved by fasting. Conditions were so desperate that money would have been of little use. Later, the understanding seemed to be that $1 per capita would be adequate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/fast-offerings-fulfilling-our-responsibility-to-others.p15\" class=\"\">However, in recent years, President Kimball has said of the fast offering: \u201cI think we should be very generous and give, instead of the amount we saved by our two meals of fasting, perhaps much, much more\u2014ten times more where we are in a position to do it.\u201d (In Conference Report, Apr. 1974, p. 184.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/fast-offerings-fulfilling-our-responsibility-to-others.p16\" class=\"\">It is important to recognize that the fast offering is a freewill offering, the amount of which each individual is responsible to determine. It is not the same as tithing, which is 10 percent of our interest annually. The amount is left up to each individual, and yet a living prophet has said we should be very generous. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if our faithfulness would generate fast offering funds sufficient to operate the entire storehouse system?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/fast-offerings-fulfilling-our-responsibility-to-others.p17\" class=\"\">Perhaps the following scriptures will give us some guidance as to how generous we should be:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/fast-offerings-fulfilling-our-responsibility-to-others.p18\" class=\"\">First, from the Doctrine and Covenants, section 42, beginning with verse 30.
