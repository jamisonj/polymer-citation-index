Some\n  people have been in the habit of calling every supernatural manifestation the effects of the Spirit of\n  God, whilst there are others that think there is no manifestation connected with it at all; and that it\n  is nothing but a mere impulse of the mind, or an inward feeling, impression, or secret testimony or\n  evidence, which men possess, and that there is no such a thing as an outward manifestation.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">It is not to be wondered at that men should be ignorant, in a great measure, of the principles of\n  salvation, and more especially of the nature, office, power, influence, gifts, and blessings of the gift\n  of the Holy Ghost, when we consider that the human family have been enveloped in gross darkness<span class=\"footRef\">3<\/span>\n  and ignorance for many centuries past, without revelation, or any just criterion [by which] to arrive\n  at a knowledge of the things of God, which can only be known by the Spirit of God.<span class=\"footRef\">4<\/span> Hence it not\n  infrequently occurs, that when the Elders of this Church preach to the inhabitants of the world, that\n  if they obey the Gospel they shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost,<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span> that the people expect to see\n  some wonderful manifestation,<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> some great display of power, or some extraordinary miracle\n  performed; and it is often the case that young members of this Church for want of better information,\n  carry along with them their old notions of things, and sometimes fall into egregious errors. We have\n  lately had some information concerning a few members that are in this dilemma, and for their\n  information make a few remarks upon the subject.<\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"106234\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 106234)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(106234)\">Lev. 25:35<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"113675\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 113675)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(113675)\">D&amp;C 38:35<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"113833\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 113833)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(113833)\">D&amp;C 44:6<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"106772\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 106772)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(106772)\">Ps. 72:13<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"115681\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 115681)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(115681)\">D&amp;C 112:23<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">4. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"109438\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 109438)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(109438)\">1 Cor. 2:11<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">5. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"109001\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 109001)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(109001)\">Acts 5:32<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">6. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"109156\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 109156)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(109156)\">Acts 19:6<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
