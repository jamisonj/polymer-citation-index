A few days ago, I attended a program celebrating the 146th anniversary of the Relief Society established by the Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr. Until then, I did not have a feeling or inspiration about what I wanted to say at conference. As I sat in that meeting attended by over three hundred sisters and saw the outstanding presentation\u2014the choir of mothers and children singing and the testimonies of half a dozen of those sisters about the joys and goodness that had come into their lives because of Relief Society\u2014I knew what I wanted to say to you today. And that is to seek the blessings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Listen to some of their comments in that meeting about the Church and its organization.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/seek-the-blessings-of-the-church.p4\" class=\"\">One sister said, \u201cI will never forget the first time the missionaries took me to church in the little branch in my home town of Santa Rosa, Philippines.

Several years ago my husband died suddenly, and I felt as if my world had collapsed around me. But just as suddenly, I was surrounded by a wonderful circle of sisters who helped bear my burden. They are always there. Our weekly trips to the temple bring such peace and comfort into my life. I rejoice in this sweet sisterhood.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/seek-the-blessings-of-the-church.p6\" class=\"\">Truly, they were no more strangers, but fellow citizens with the Saints (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"21989\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21989)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21989)\">Eph. 2:19<\/a><\/span>).

Those few minutes that day touched my spirit, and I felt like a child who had discovered a treasure. There were feelings within me that I cannot fully explain, but I recognized what the Church had done to bless my life and everyone around me who had truly accepted it and become involved in it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/seek-the-blessings-of-the-church.p8\" class=\"\">Central to everything that Christ would have us understand and receive is the great power that comes to us when we draw close to Him through our acts, our compassion, and our personal change in becoming like Him.

He has given us His Spirit to guide us and His truth and His church to influence us to recognize these powers and use them. One great man in Book of Mormon days who fought against these principles and teachings of the church was Alma the Younger, who was struck dumb and, after the Church spent days of fasting and prayer, was revived and spoke these words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/seek-the-blessings-of-the-church.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cFor, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/seek-the-blessings-of-the-church.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/seek-the-blessings-of-the-church.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40714\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40714)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40714)\">Mosiah 27:24\u201326<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/seek-the-blessings-of-the-church.p12\" class=\"\">Alma had become a new creature, born of the spirit.

I don\u2019t remember one child who didn\u2019t love the Savior or who didn\u2019t understand and live the law of tithing.

Loving leaders and teachers provide warmth, security, activities, music, theater, and athletics, as well as the teachings of the Savior to help us to learn how to love Him, to try to be like Him, and to serve others. Our seven-year-old grandson has, through the Primary and the example of his father, found the wonder and blessing of the New Testament and now carries his little edition around, reading it often.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Our young women are trying to put faith, prayer, individual worth, knowledge, choice, accountability, integrity, the divine nature, and good works into their lives to get understanding about their future roles in this world and forever. Through many service projects they share their lives, their testimonies, and their influence to help others come unto Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A young man in Michigan several years ago fell in love with an LDS girl. He was told forthrightly and with great love that she wanted the power of the priesthood in her home and the blessings of an eternal family, and she would only marry someone who could give her those blessings. The teachings she had received had taken root, and the seeds of faith, knowledge, and choice had grown, and she knew that they were true. The young man felt her spirit and agreed to be taught the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>And after he had learned that the gospel was true, his father would not approve his baptism. A great shepherd, a bishop of the young girl, went to the father and helped him to see the value of that young woman, her standards, the Church, and the really truly important things in life. The father was touched that day as he attended the baptism and saw about twenty young men and women of the Church. Following the service, he asked that the missionaries come teach him. A young woman had taken on the divine nature and was able to share the priceless truths with others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>And what about our young men, all men actually, as they learn how to exercise the priesthood of God?

And we saw the results a few months ago as nearly all of those Scouts he had led assembled and stood in this Tabernacle\u2014a witness of what had been done for them in this church.

In these quorums and in the auxiliaries of the Church, I see opportunities for intellectual development, for social efficiency. In the judicial phase of the Church I see ample means of settling difficulties, of establishing harmony in society, of administering justice, and of perpetuating peace among individuals and groups.
