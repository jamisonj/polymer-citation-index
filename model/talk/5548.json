A spirit of quiet reverence permeated the gathering as an organ prelude of hymns was played. I gazed at those who sat before me. There were mothers and fathers and relatively few children. The majority of those who sat on crowded benches were women about middle age\u2014and alone. Suddenly it dawned on me that perhaps these were widows, having lost their husbands during World War II. My curiosity demanded an answer to my unexpressed thought, so I asked the conducting officer to take a sort of standing roll call. When he asked all those who were widows to please arise, it seemed that half the vast throng stood. Their faces reflected the grim effect of war\u2019s cruelty. Their hopes had been shattered, their lives altered, and their future had in a way been taken from them. Behind each countenance was a personal travail of tears. I addressed my remarks to them and to all who have loved, then lost, those most dear.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-fatherless-and-the-widows-beloved-of-god.p4\" class=\"\">Frederick W. Babbel, who accompanied Elder Ezra Taft Benson on his postwar visit to Europe to assist the struggling Saints, recounts in his book <span class=\"emphasis\">On Wings of Faith<\/span> one heartrending account. A woman, even the mother of four small children, had been newly widowed. Her husband, young and handsome, whom she loved more than life itself, had been killed during the final days of the frightful battles in their homeland of East Prussia. She and her children were forced to flee to West Germany, a distance of a thousand miles. The weather was mild as they began their long and difficult trek on foot. Constantly being faced with dangers from panicky refugees and marauding troops was difficult enough, but then came the cold of winter, with its accompanying snow and ice. Her resources were meager; now they were gone. All she had was her strong faith in God and in the gospel as revealed to the latter-day prophet Joseph Smith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-fatherless-and-the-widows-beloved-of-god.p5\" class=\"\">And then one morning the unthinkable happened. She awakened with a chill in her heart. The tiny form of her three-year-old daughter was cold and still, and she realized that death had claimed her. With great effort the mother prepared a shallow grave and buried her precious child.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-fatherless-and-the-widows-beloved-of-god.p6\" class=\"\">Death, however, was to be her companion again and again on the journey. Her seven-year-old perished, and then her five-year-old. Her despair was all-consuming. Finally, as she was reaching the end of her travel, the baby died in her arms. She had lost her husband and all her children. She had given up all her earthly goods, her home, and even her homeland.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-fatherless-and-the-widows-beloved-of-god.p7\" class=\"\">From the depths of her despair, she knelt and prayed more fervently than she had ever prayed in her life: \u201cDear Heavenly Father, I do not know how I can go on. I have nothing left\u2014except my faith in thee. I feel amidst the desolation of my soul an overwhelming gratitude for the atoning sacrifice of thy Son, Jesus Christ. I know that because he suffered and died, I shall live again with my family; that because he broke the chains of death, I shall see my children again in the flesh and will have the joy of raising them. Though I do not at this moment wish to live, I will do so, that we may be reunited as a family and return, together, to thee.\u201d This prayer, this testimony sustained her until finally she reached Karlsruhe, her destination.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-fatherless-and-the-widows-beloved-of-god.p8\" class=\"\">Though perhaps not so cruel and dramatic, yet equally poignant, are the lives described in the obituaries of our day and time when the uninvited enemy called death enters the stage of our mortal existence and snatches from our grasp a loving husband or precious wife and frequently, in the young exuberance of life, our children and grandchildren. Death shows no mercy. Death is no respecter of persons, but in its insidious way it visits all. At times it is after long-suffering and is a blessing, while in other instances those in the prime of life are taken by its grasp.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-fatherless-and-the-widows-beloved-of-god.p9\" class=\"\">As of old, the heartbroken frequently and silently repeat the ancient question: \u201cIs there no balm in Gilead \u2026 ?\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-94911_000_027\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26598\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26598)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26598)\">Jer. 8:22<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> \u201cWhy me; why now?\u201d The words of a beautiful hymn provide a partial answer:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Where can I turn for peace?

It is what my missionary-minded husband would like.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-fatherless-and-the-widows-beloved-of-god.p50\" class=\"\">The gift was received and entered as a most substantial donation to missionary service. I saw the receipt made in her name, but I believe in my heart it was also recorded in heaven. I invited her and President Richards to follow me to the unoccupied First Presidency Council room in the Church Administration Building. The room is beautiful and peaceful. I asked this sweet widow to sit in the chair usually occupied by our church President. I felt he would not mind, for I knew his heart. As she sat ever so humbly in the large leather chair, she gripped each armrest with a hand and declared, \u201cThis is one of the happiest days of my life.\u201d It was also such for President Richards and for me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-fatherless-and-the-widows-beloved-of-god.p51\" class=\"\">I never travel to work along busy Seventh East in Salt Lake City but what I see in my mind\u2019s eye a thoughtful daughter, afflicted with arthritis and carrying in her hand a plate of warm food to her aged mother who lived across the busy thoroughfare. She has now gone home to that mother who preceded her in passing. But her lesson was not lost on her daughters, who delight their widowed father by cleaning his house each week, inviting him to dinners in their homes, and sharing with him the laughter of good times together, leaving in that widower\u2019s heart a prayer of gratitude for his daughters, the light of his life. Fathers experience loneliness as well as mothers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-fatherless-and-the-widows-beloved-of-god.p52\" class=\"\">One evening at Christmastime, my wife and I visited a nursing home in Salt Lake City. We looked in vain for a 95-year-old widow whose memory had become clouded and who could not speak a word. An attendant led us in our search, and we found Nell in the dining room. She had eaten her meal; she was sitting silently, staring into space. She did not show us any sign of recognition. As I reached to take her hand, she withdrew it. I noticed that she held firmly to a Christmas greeting card. The attendant smiled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know who sent that card, but she will not lay it aside. She doesn\u2019t speak, but pats the card and holds it to her lips and kisses it.\u201d I recognized the card. It was one my wife, Frances, had sent to Nell the week before. We left Maytime Manor more filled with the Christmas spirit than when we entered. We kept to ourselves the mystery of that special card and the life it had gladdened and the heart it had touched. Heaven was nearby.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-fatherless-and-the-widows-beloved-of-god.p53\" class=\"\">We need not wait for Christmas, we need not postpone till Thanksgiving Day our response to the Savior\u2019s tender admonition: \u201cGo, and do thou likewise.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote13-94911_000_027\">13<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32500\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32500)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32500)\">Luke 10:37<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-fatherless-and-the-widows-beloved-of-god.p54\" class=\"\">As we follow in his footsteps, as we ponder his thoughts and his deeds, as we keep his commandments, we will be blessed.
