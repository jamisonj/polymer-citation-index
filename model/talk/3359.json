A small number of men and women, including the Prophet Joseph Smith, gathered in the home of Peter Whitmer, Sr., to witness and participate in the official organization of the Church. Today there are over 4 1\/2 million members in eighty-one countries. We now look in retrospect on 150 years of the history of the Church and are led to exclaim with Isaiah, \u201cTruly the work is marvelous and wonderful!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/a-marvelous-work-and-a-wonder.p5\" class=\"\">That the Church of Jesus Christ would have an inconspicuous beginning and then enjoy phenomenal growth was likewise predicted. Jesus used the comparison of the small mustard seed to describe the early beginning of His church. But eventually, He declared, that insignificant seed would become a great tree and many would find refuge in its branches (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"36708\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36708)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36708)\">Matt. 13:31\u201332<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/a-marvelous-work-and-a-wonder.p6\" class=\"\">The prophet Daniel described the beginning and remarkable growth of the Church as a small stone which would become a great mountain and fill the entire earth!

The growth of the Church, like the growth of grass or trees, has been almost imperceptible to the eye, but little by little, line by line, precept by precept, the Church has matured.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/a-marvelous-work-and-a-wonder.p8\" class=\"\">Simultaneous with the early development of the Church was a spirit of opposition and persecution. Wherever the tiny \u201cmustard seed\u201d was planted, attempts were made to frustrate its growth. But notwithstanding all the efforts to destroy the work\u2014even the murder of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother\u2014the Church prospered and grew. There were those who thought the Church would fail with the deaths of the martyrs Joseph and Hyrum, but they did not perceive, as Daniel foretold, that this latter-day kingdom should \u201cnever be destroyed\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10768\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10768)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10768)\">Dan. 2:44<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/a-marvelous-work-and-a-wonder.p9\" class=\"\">Just before the Prophet\u2019s death, Brigham Young said, \u201cThe kingdom is organized; and, although as yet no bigger than a grain of mustard seed, the little plant is in a flourishing condition\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 6:354).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/a-marvelous-work-and-a-wonder.p10\" class=\"\">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is, as Daniel prophesied, a spiritual kingdom \u201ccut out of the mountain without hands\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10771\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10771)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10771)\">Dan. 2:45<\/a><\/span>), meaning that it was begun through the intervention of God. It is not just another human institution. What other organizations or churches ascribe their founding to the declaration that messengers have come to human beings from the God of heaven with authority and power to restore ordinances and keys lost by apostasy?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/a-marvelous-work-and-a-wonder.p11\" class=\"\">The Church has survived exile from four states, the harassment and persecution of its members, an extermination order from a governor, the execution of its prophet, disenfranchisement by the government, and continuous persecution of its leaders and people. That is what this church endured and survived in the first sixty years of its history\u2014and it was through such adversity, persecution, and impoverishment that the Church gained strength and matured. By the time Joseph F. Smith, the son of the Prophet Joseph\u2019s brother Hyrum, became President, he could say, \u201cWe have passed through the stages of infancy \u2026 , and are indeed approaching \u2026 manhood and womanhood\u201d (in Conference Report, Apr. 1909, p. 2).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/a-marvelous-work-and-a-wonder.p12\" class=\"\">Opposition to the Church did not subside with the twentieth century, but gradually people came to see us for what we stood for, rather than what our enemies said about us. Our Mormon boys fought in two world wars and were recognized for their standards and principles. During the Great Depression of the thirties, the Church came to be known for independence, self-reliance, and taking care of its own. And over the century, Latter-day Saints distinguished themselves in the fields of science, education, medicine, business, and other endeavors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/a-marvelous-work-and-a-wonder.p13\" class=\"\">The missionary force brought a harvest of converts from all over the world.

When Joseph Fielding Smith, son of President Joseph F. Smith, became President of the Church, he declared: \u201cWe are coming of age as a church and as a people. We have attained the stature and strength that are enabling us to fulfill the commission given us by the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith that we should carry the glad tidings of the restoration to every nation and to all people\u201d (in Conference Report, Manchester England Area Conference 1971, p. 5).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/a-marvelous-work-and-a-wonder.p14\" class=\"\">Two years later, President Smith\u2019s successor, President Harold B.

Never in this dispensation, and perhaps never before in any single period, has there been such a feeling of urgency among the members of this church as today.

Opposition has been and will be the lot of the Saints of the kingdom in any age. The finger of scorn has been pointed at us in the past, and we may expect it in the future. We also expect to see men in high places defend the Church; there will also be \u201cpharaohs\u201d who know neither Joseph nor his brethren. The seed planted and watered in 1830 has now matured to a fully grown tree for all to see.

The mission of the Church is to herald the message of salvation and make unmistakably clear the pathway to exaltation. Our mission is to prepare a people for the coming of the Lord. As the world drifts further away from God and standards of virtue and honor, we may expect opposition to the work of the Church. We may expect to see the time, as the Book of Mormon forecasts, when \u201cmultitudes \u2026 among all the nations of the Gentiles [will gather] to fight against the Lamb of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1769\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1769)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1769)\">1 Ne. 14:13<\/a><\/span>).
