This saying it would be well for the\npeople of America to remember.\n<\/p><p>\nOUR COUNTRY UNDER DIVINE GUIDANCE\n<\/p><p>\nNo nation has been more greatly blessed than has the United States. We live in a land which\nhas been called choice above all other lands by divine pronouncement\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1438\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1438)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1438)\">1 Ne. 2:20<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3454\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3454)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3454)\">2 Ne. 10:19<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22151\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22151)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22151)\">Ether 2:7<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Lord has watched\nover it with a jealous care and has commanded its people to serve Him lest His wrath be\nkindled against them and His blessings be withdrawn. Our government came into existence\nthrough divine guidance. The inspiration of the Lord rested upon the patriots who established\nit, and inspired them through the dark days of their struggle for independence and through the\ncritical period which followed that struggle when they framed our glorious Constitution which\nguarantees to all the self-evident truth proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence, \"that all\nmen are created equal: that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights:\nthat among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" That is to say, it is the right\nof every soul to have equal and unrestricted justice before the law, equal rights to worship\naccording to the dictates of conscience and to labor according to the individual inclinations,\nindependently of coercion or compulsion. That this might be, the Lord has said, \"I established\nthe Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very\npurpose and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11905\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11905)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11905)\">D&amp;C 101:80<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe founders of this nation were men of humble faith. Many of them saw in vision a glorious\ndestiny for our government, provided we would faithfully continue in the path of justice and\nright with contrite spirits and humble hearts, accepting the divine truths which are found in\nthe Holy Scriptures. The appeal of these men has echoed down the passing years with\nprophetic warning to the succeeding generations, pleading with them to be true to all these\nstandards which lay at the foundation of our government. This country was founded as a\nChristian nation, with the acceptance of Jesus Christ as the Redeemer of the world. It was\npredicted by a prophet of old that this land would be a land of liberty and it would be\nfortified against all other nations as long as its inhabitants would serve Jesus Christ; but\nshould they stray from the Son of God, it would cease to be a land of liberty and His anger\nbe kindled against them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3453\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3453)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3453)\">2 Ne. 1:7<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22152\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22152)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22152)\">Ether 2:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nDANGER IN FORSAKING RIGHTEOUSNESS\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a sad reflection, but one that cannot be successfully refuted, that we have forgotten the\nadmonition which has come down to us, just as Israel forgot the commandments which would\nhave blessed that nation in the land of Canaan forever had they been observed. In forsaking\nthese laws we stand in danger of punishment as the people of Israel stood in danger of\npunishment because they forsook the Lord and failed to repent and accept the warnings of\ntheir prophets.\n<\/p><p>\nSince the days of our fathers there has been a gradual straying froth the sacred teachings\nwhich we have received. In later years we have, in fact, fulfilled the prophecy of Paul:\n<\/p><p>\nThis know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.<br \/>\nFor men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,\ndisobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,<br \/>\nWithout natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those\nthat are good,<br \/>\nTraitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;<br \/>\nHaving a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5089\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5089)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5089)\">2 Tim. 3:1-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis is a very severe indictment made by Paul; but can we honestly deny the charge? The Ten\nCommandments (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22521\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22521)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22521)\">Ex. 20:3-17<\/a><\/span>)\nare just as much the word of the Lord today as they were when written by\nthe finger of God on Sinai. They have not been abrogated; they have not been modified and\nare binding upon the people with all the force which accompanied them when first uttered. As\nsure as we live, we are to be judged by them and all other divine commandments, for God\nwill not permit us to mock Him and hold His laws in contempt with impunity\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23220\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23220)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23220)\">Gal. 6:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHave not the people of this land ignored the first commandment?\n<\/p><p>\nThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy\nmind.<br \/>\nThis is the first and great commandment.<br \/>\nAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<br \/>\nOn these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33855\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33855)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33855)\">Matt. 22:37-40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn other words, all that has been revealed for the salvation of man from the beginning to our\nown time is circumscribed, included in, and a part of these two great laws. If we love the\nLord with all the heart, with all the soul, and with all the mind, and our neighbors as\nourselves (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33850\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33850)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33850)\">Matt. 22:36-39<\/a><\/span>),\nthen there is nothing more to be desired. Then we will be in harmony with the total\nof sacred law. If we were willing to live in harmony with these two great\ncommandments&mdash;and we must do so eventually if we are worthy to live in the presence of\nGod&mdash;then wickedness, jealousy, ambition, covetousness, bloodshed, and all sin of every\nnature would be banished from the earth. Then would come a day of eternal peace and\nhappiness. What a glorious day that would be! We have been endowed with sufficient reason\nto know that such a state is most desirable and would establish among men the Fatherhood of\nGod and the perfect brotherhood of man.\n<\/p><p>\nBut as a people have we not forsaken these commandments? Can we say that we love the\nLord with all the soul? Can we say we are as Solicitous for the welfare of our neighbor as we\nare for our own? As we look about us, we cannot fail to see the selfishness, the unbelief,\nblasphemy, and love of evil which are found everywhere among the people, all revealing to\nus our weakness and unwillingness to obey these laws. We are not ignorant of the things of\nGod, for they have been made known to us from the days of Adam until now and are\nrecorded in the Holy Scriptures. Messengers from the presence of God have been sent to the\nearth from the beginning to establish in the hearts of men and to reveal to them all that is\nessential for man's salvation. If any among us is ignorant of these things, it is due to wilful\nrebellion. The Son of God came to earth Himself to show us by example the way to eternal\nlife, and was Himself free from all sin. We cannot excuse ourselves for the violation of the\nlaws of God on the ground of ignorance. With all of these commandments before us, we are\nmoral agents responsible to the Most High and under obligation to be obedient. Nevertheless,\nbecause of the love of the things of the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1020\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1020)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1020)\">1 Jn. 2:15<\/a><\/span>)\nand the enticing influence of the powers of\ndarkness, we have departed from the strait path which leads to life and which our Lord has\nsaid few men find because they love darkness rather than light, their deeds being evil\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27092\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27092)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27092)\">John 3:19<\/a><\/span>). We\nhave permitted the philosophies of men, which deny the divinity of Jesus Christ and mock at\nthe sacred ordinances of the gospel, to enter into our schools, our businesses, and our homes,\nthus weakening our faith and our reverence for our Creator. We have forgotten that man was\ncreated in the image of God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23461\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23461)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23461)\">Gen. 1:26-27<\/a><\/span>),\nthat the scriptures declare that we are His offspring\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7509\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7509)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7509)\">Acts 17:29<\/a><\/span>), and that we\nare commanded to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33835\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33835)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33835)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLAWS OF GOD TO BE OBEYED\n<\/p><p>\nAre we keeping our bodies clean and free from all contaminating influences?

Unfortunately\nthere are many selfish, greedy agencies at work playing upon the credulity and ignorance of\nthe people, enticing them to indulge in many evil habits which weaken and impair their\nvitality and drive them from the spiritual guidance promised them through their humility and\nfaith.\n<\/p><p>\nHave we observed the Sabbath day and kept it holy\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22522\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22522)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22522)\">Ex. 20:8<\/a><\/span>)? Is it not a fact that we have looked upon\nthis law as being obsolete; something suited, perhaps to the needs of a primitive people, who,\nlike little children, need special care, but not necessary for us to observe in this modern world\nof superior wisdom? Is it not the fact that through the length and breadth of our land, this\nsacred commandment has been treated, and is being treated, with absolute contempt? Have we\nnot made of it a day of pleasure, of indulgence, and have we not lost all love for its\nsacredness? How can we expect the Lord to bless us when we ignore so universally this holy\nlaw?\n<\/p><p>\nHave we not forgotten to pray and to thank the Lord for His mercies and for His guidance in\nall that we do? If at times we have been requested to seek the help of the Lord in this great\nstruggle which has deluged the world, have we prayed in the true spirit of prayer? What good\ndoes it do for us to petition the Lord, if we have no intention of keeping His commandments?\nSuch praying is hollow mockery and an insult before the throne of grace. How dare we\npresume to expect a favorable answer if such is the case? \"Seek ye the Lord while he may be\nfound, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous\nman his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to\nour God, for he will abundantly pardon.\" So said Isaiah\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25003\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25003)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25003)\">Isa. 55:6-7<\/a><\/span>). But is not the Lord\nalways near when we petition Him? Verily no! He has said, \"They were slow to hearken unto\nthe voice of the Lord their God; therefore, the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their\nprayers, to answer them in the day of their trouble. In the day of their peace they esteemed\nlightly my counsel; but, in the day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11900\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11900)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11900)\">D&amp;C 101:7-8<\/a><\/span>).\nIf we draw near unto Him, He will draw near unto us\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11889\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11889)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11889)\">D&amp;C 88:63<\/a><\/span>), and we will not be forsaken;\nbut if we do not draw near to Him, we have no promise that He will answer us in our\nrebellion.\n<\/p><p>\nAre we free from all covetousness? Do we refrain from desiring to possess unjustly the\nproperty of others? Have we permitted the lusts of the flesh and the desire to possess that\nwhich is not our honest due, to canker our souls?\n<\/p><p>\nHave we not come to look upon the sacred and holy bonds of matrimony as merely a civil\ncontract which may be broken at will on the slightest whim by either covenanting party? Has\nnot divorce become a blot upon the nation? How can we reconcile our practices and the\nstatutes of many states with the commandments given us by Jesus Christ in relation to the\nmarriage covenant? The home is the foundation of civilization and vital to the safety of our\ncountry. When the home is destroyed, the foundation of the country is in danger of\ndestruction. Such has been the history of the past among nations. Marriage is a sacred\nordinance instituted before death came into the world when the Lord said, \"It is not good that\nthe man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23465\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23465)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23465)\">Gen. 2:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSUFFERING COMES THROUGH LOSS OF BLESSINGS\n<\/p><p>\nThroughout our land we see the tragedy of broken homes, fathers and mothers separated,\nchildren denied the natural affections. Children have a right to the blessings coming from this\nsacred union. They are entitled to the love and care of faithful parents and the happiness and\ndevotion which true worship brings. When these blessings are lost, the whole community\nsuffers and the integrity of government is weakened. It is a shame and a disgrace that so\nmuch evil is coming out of broken homes, and this comes largely because we have forgotten\nGod and our obligations to serve and honor Him. Truly we have much room for repentance\nand a return to the simple worship of true Christianity.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE NEED FOR RELIGION\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Calvin Coolidge once said:\n<\/p><p>\nOur government rests upon religion. It is from that source that we derive our reverence for\ntruth and justice, for equality and liberality and for the rights of mankind. Unless the people\nbelieve in these principles they cannot believe in our government. There are only two main\ntheories of government in the world. One rests on righteousness and the other on force One\nappeals to reason, the other appeals to the sword. One is exemplified in a republic, the other\nis represented by a despotism.\n<\/p><p>\nThe government of a country never gets ahead of the religion of a country. There is no way\nby which we can substitute the authority of law for the virtue of men. Of course we can help\nto restrain the vicious and furnish a fair degree of security and protection by legislation and\npolice control, but the real reform which society in these days is seeking will come as a result\nof religious convictions, or they will not come at all. Peace, justice, charity&mdash;these cannot be\nlegislated into being. They are the result of Divine Grace.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is true that a country cannot get ahead of its religion. The higher our ideals, the nearer we\nobserve divine law, and the stronger are our spiritual forces. No Christian country can forsake\nthe divinity of Jesus Christ and not suffer. In those lands in Europe where paganism has\nsuperseded the Christian ideals, there is bound to come decay and eventually, if there is no\nrepentance, their former greatness will be forgotten. Jesus said: \"And why call ye me, Lord,\nLord, and do not the things which I say?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31105\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31105)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31105)\">Luke 6:46<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHere is another inspiring thought. It was copied from a panel on the wall in the chapel at\nStanford University.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is no narrowing so deadly as the narrowing of man's horizon of spiritual things. No\nworse evil could befall him in his course on earth than to lose sight of heaven; and it is not\ncivilization that can prevent this; it is not civilization that can compensate for it. No widening\nof science, no possession of abstract truth, can indemnify for an enfeebled hold on the highest\nand eternal truth of humanity.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat shall a man give in exchange for his soul? (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33847\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33847)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33847)\">Matt. 16:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBut some one will say: \"Are we not living in the most enlightened age the world has ever\nseen? Is it not true that great progress is being made to lessen the burdens and increase the\nhappiness of man?\" Yes, this is true in regard to many material things. Great progress has\nbeen made in mechanics, chemistry, physics, surgery, and other things. Men have built great\ntelescopes that have brought the hidden galaxies to view. They have, by the aid of the\nmicroscope, discovered vast worlds of microorganisms, some of which are as deadly as are\nmen towards their fellow men. They have discovered means to control disease; they have, by\nthe aid of anesthesia, made men insensible to pain, thus permitting major and delicate\noperations which could not otherwise be performed. They have invented machines more\nsensitive than the human touch, more far-seeing than the human eye. They have controlled\nelements and made machinery that can move mountains, and many other things have they\ndone too numerous to mention. Yes, this is a wonderful age. However, all of these\ndiscoveries and inventions have not drawn men nearer to God! \n<\/p><p>\nNor created in their hearts humility and the spirit of repentance, but to the contrary, to their\ncondemnation. Nearly everything, it seems, which has been given that should be a blessing to\nmen, has been turned to evil. Many of these discoveries and inventions are now being used\nto bring destruction to the human race. They are being used in the most cruel, most inhuman,\ngodless war this world has ever seen. They are employed by criminals to aid them in their\ncrimes, by the ambitious in their efforts to destroy the agency of man, and by despots who\nare endeavoring to subjugate the world to an unholy, wicked rule. \n<\/p><p>\nFaith has not increased in the world, nor has righteousness, nor obedience to God. What the\nworld needs today is to draw nearer to the Lord. We need more humble, abiding faith in our\nRedeemer, more love in our hearts for our Eternal Father and for our fellow men. Yes, this is\na good time, a vital time&mdash;if we are to survive the forces of evil&mdash;for every man every man to\nforsake the paths of sin and turn unto the Lord who will abundantly pardon\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25005\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25005)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25005)\">Isa. 55:7<\/a><\/span>).
