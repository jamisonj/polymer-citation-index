And it made such an impression upon me as a boy that it has been a guiding star to me all my life, and I could hardly wait until I was old enough to go on a mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/a-testimony.p6\" class=\"\">When I went on my first mission back in 1905, my cousin and I traveled together to Liverpool; he was sent up into Norway and I was sent to Holland. After we had been in the mission field a few months, I received a letter from him, addressing me by name, and he said: \u201cI met a man the other day who knows more about religion than I ever dreamed of.

If he has something better than you have, you ought to join his church.\u201d Then I quoted some of the experiences that Brother Fyans related to us this morning. I said: \u201cDoes he have something better than a personal visitation of God the Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ, in a pillar of light, after centuries of spiritual darkness, to open the dispensation of the fulness of times and to reveal the true personality of the Godhead\u2014that they are glorified personages?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/a-testimony.p8\" class=\"\">I said: \u201cDoes he have something better than the coming of Moroni with the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated?

Does he have something better than the coming of Peter, James, and John\u2014Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ\u2014with the holy Melchizedek Priesthood, the holy Apostleship, the authority to organize the church and kingdom of God for the last time to prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man and to convey the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/11\/a-testimony.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cDoes he have something better than the coming of Moses with the keys of the latter-day gathering of Israel that has brought us here into these valleys of the mountains?

And if they had the truth, they would all be alike; and so there had to be a restitution.
