The two shared a special bond from these hours together. Lachelle soon turned five years old and was preparing to begin school. On their last morning together, Grandma Squire read her granddaughter a story and rocked her in the big rocking chair. \u201cWe have had so much fun together, Lachelle,\u201d she told her, \u201cand now it is time for you to go to school. I love you so much; what will I ever do without you?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p6\" class=\"\">With wisdom beyond her five years, Lachelle looked up at her grandmother with big brown eyes. \u201cGrandma,\u201d she said, \u201cI love you too, but it is time I got on with my life.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p7\" class=\"\">That is good counsel for all of us. We too need to \u201cget on with our lives.\u201d Most of us do not seek or even welcome dramatic changes. But change is an essential part of life\u2019s experiences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p8\" class=\"\">Many of these changes come as we naturally make our way through our earthly journey. Our lives change as we progress from childhood through youth and on into adulthood and finally old age. Schooling, missions, marriage, employment, and retirement are all examples of milestones of change.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p9\" class=\"\">Too often we are reluctant to enter the next stage, begin the next challenge. Maybe we are too comfortable, fearful, or lacking in faith. Grandmother\u2019s lap is often more comfortable than the trials of kindergarten. Our parents\u2019 basement, with unlimited video games, may be more appealing than college, marriage, or a career.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p10\" class=\"\">How can we then best prepare for the changes we must inevitably face as we progress through life?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p11\" class=\"\">First, follow the prophets. Listen to and abide by the counsel of the Brethren. Prophets often raise a voice of warning but also provide steady, pragmatic counsel to help us weather the storms of life. In the opening section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord reminds us, \u201cWhether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"118085\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 118085)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(118085)\">D&amp;C 1:38<\/a><\/span>). Prophets help us confront the changes and challenges we constantly face. The popular Primary song \u201cFollow the Prophet\u201d reminds us of this important principle: \u201cWe can get direction all along our way, if we heed the prophets\u2014follow what they say\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Children\u2019s Songbook,<\/span> 111).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p12\" class=\"\">Second, keep an eternal perspective. Understand that change and challenges are part of God\u2019s plan. By design this mortal existence is a time of testing or a time \u201cto see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"118211\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 118211)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(118211)\">Abraham 3:25<\/a><\/span>). In order to test our use of our God-given agency, we as mortals undergo a series of changes, challenges, trials, and temptations as we proceed through life. Only then are we properly tested.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p13\" class=\"\">In 2\u00a0Nephi we read: \u201cFor it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, \u2026 righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117965\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117965)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117965)\">2\u00a0Nephi 2:11<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p14\" class=\"\">Life\u2019s challenges and changes provide opportunities for us to grow as we exercise our agency in making righteous decisions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p15\" class=\"\">Third, have faith. President Gordon\u00a0B. Hinckley always encouraged members of the Church to move forward with faith (see \u201cGod Hath Not Given Us the Spirit of Fear,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Oct. 1984, 4). As we daily confront a world full of negativity, doubt, fear, and even dread can creep into our hearts. President Thomas\u00a0S. Monson has counseled us that \u201cfaith and doubt cannot exist in the same mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other\u201d (\u201cCome unto Him in Prayer and Faith,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Mar. 2009, 4; <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Mar. 2009, 6). In Moroni we read that \u201cwithout faith there cannot be any hope\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"118078\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 118078)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(118078)\">Moroni 7:42<\/a><\/span>). We must exercise faith to take on life\u2019s challenges and changes. It is how we learn and progress.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p16\" class=\"\">Fourth, be of good cheer. Many of our members across the globe are facing challenges, economic and otherwise. At such times it is easy to feel despondent and forgotten. During the early, difficult days of the Church, the Lord counseled the Saints to be happy: \u201cBe of good cheer, little children; for I am in your midst, and I have not forsaken you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"118124\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 118124)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(118124)\">D&amp;C 61:36<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p17\" class=\"\">In his last conference talk, six months ago, Elder Joseph\u00a0B. Wirthlin taught how to respond to adversity. Part of his counsel included: \u201cThe next time you\u2019re tempted to groan, you might try to laugh instead. It will extend your life and make the lives of all those around you more enjoyable\u201d (\u201cCome What May, and Love It,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 2008, 27). Laughter and a good sense of humor can soften the bumps along life\u2019s journey.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p18\" class=\"\">It would be nice if we could anticipate all the changes that would occur in a lifetime. Some changes we see coming. Certainly all Latter-day Saint young men are taught to prepare for a full-time mission, a life-changing experience. Every worthy young single adult understands the importance of choosing a spouse and being sealed in the holy temple. We know these changes are coming, and we can plan for them. But what about the changes which are thrust upon us rather unexpectedly? These are changes over which we seemingly have no control. Economic downturn, unemployment, debilitating sickness or injury, divorce, and death are examples of change we do not expect, anticipate, or welcome. How do we deal with such unexpected setbacks in life\u2019s journey?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p19\" class=\"\">The answer is the same. By listening to the prophets, keeping an eternal perspective, having faith, and being of good cheer, we can face life\u2019s unexpected challenges and \u201cget on with our lives.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p20\" class=\"\">The lives of the early pioneers are excellent examples of how we should accept change and overcome challenges and difficulties.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p21\" class=\"\">Robert Gardner Jr. was baptized into the Church in January of 1845 in a frozen pond in the backwoods of eastern Canada. Faithful and industrious, he made his way with his family to Nauvoo and, after much hardship, arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in October of 1847. After entering the valley, they camped at a place called Old Fort, located a few blocks from this Conference Center. In his handwritten history, he recorded, \u201cI unyoked my oxen and sat down on my broken wagon tongue, and said I could not go another day\u2019s journey\u201d (\u201cRobert Gardner Jr. Self History and Journal,\u201d Church History Library, 23).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p22\" class=\"\">Starting with nothing, Robert began to create a new life for himself and his family. The first years were hard, but gradually things improved as he and his brother Archibald began to develop mills on Mill Creek and the Jordan River. A few years later he suffered a reversal of fortune. The water powering his mill was taken upstream, leaving his portion of the stream dry. An attempt to build a six-mile (10-km) canal to the mill failed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p23\" class=\"\">Again from his history: \u201cThe canal kept breaking until it proved a failure. The failure caused me to lose all my crops and my mill would not run. My stock was all gone and I was flat broke\u201d (\u201cRobert Gardner Jr. Self History and Journal,\u201d 26).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p24\" class=\"\">If that was not test enough, his next entry in his history informs us he has been called on a mission to Canada. A few months later he left his family and with a contingent of missionaries traveled by handcart, steamboat, and railroad to his field of labor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p25\" class=\"\">He completed this mission, returned to his family, and through hard work and diligence once again established himself and began to prosper.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p26\" class=\"\">Just a few years later Brother Gardner was entertaining some friends at his farm in Millcreek in the Salt Lake Valley. One remarked, \u201cI am glad to see you so well recovered from being broke. You are nearly as well off as you were before you lost your property and went on your mission.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p27\" class=\"\">Robert\u2019s history records: \u201cMy reply was; \u2018Yes I was well off once and it all went off, and I am almost afraid of another [mission] call.\u2019 Sure enough, a few hours later some of my neighbors, who had been to a meeting in Salt Lake City called in and told me that my name was amongst a number of names who were called today to go south on a mission to make a new settlement and raise cotton. We were to start right away.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p28\" class=\"\">He records, <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cI looked and spit, took off my hat and scratched [my head] and thought and said; \u2018All right\u2019\u201d<\/span> (\u201cRobert Gardner Jr. Self History and Journal,\u201d 35; emphasis added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/get-on-with-our-lives.p29\" class=\"\">Robert Gardner knew what it meant to deal with change in his life. He followed the counsel of the Brethren, accepting calls to serve when it was not convenient. He had a great love for the Lord and demonstrated strong, unbending faith with amazing good humor and grace. Robert Gardner Jr. went on to become a leading pioneer in the colonization effort of southern Utah. It is he and countless pioneers like him who give us inspiration to carry on and confront fearlessly the many changes and challenges which come into our lives. As we move forward and \u201cget on with our lives,\u201d may we be obedient, faithful, and cheerful is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
