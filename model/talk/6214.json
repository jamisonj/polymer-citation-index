May we be blessed and guided by the Spirit to hear and feel this evening.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/fellowshipping.p5\" class=\"\">A number of years ago I received a telephone call that would change my life\u2014my eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/fellowshipping.p6\" class=\"\">A good sister from my ward called to invite me to perform a dance floor show number at a Mutual activity evening that was being held in a couple of weeks. Dancing was a hobby of mine, and I was studying ballroom dancing at a studio in Salt Lake City. I had never been to a youth MIA dance before, and I was excited to accept the invitation to perform.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/fellowshipping.p7\" class=\"\">My partner and I arrived on the appointed evening and were greeted enthusiastically. I was surprised to find that we were the only ones on the program. It was an exciting experience, and I thoroughly enjoyed the evening.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/fellowshipping.p8\" class=\"\">The following Sunday morning, I decided to go to church in our ward for the first time since I was ordained a deacon. At that time, none of my family was active. I found people who welcomed me warmly, and they demonstrated a genuine friendship and caring. These experiences started me on the road to activity and service in the Church that has been a joy to me throughout the years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/fellowshipping.p9\" class=\"\">The senior Aaronic Priesthood committee, as it was called then, was a group of brethren who worked with men who were older than the normal Aaronic Priesthood age. These were just regular men who were doing what the Lord wanted them to do. They took me under their wing, and we became good friends. A wonderful returned missionary gave our class instruction. He taught the basics of the gospel and helped prepare me to serve a mission. During this same time I was asked to help teach dancing in the ward, which gave me a feeling of being needed, and it also gave me a responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/fellowshipping.p10\" class=\"\">The next 15 months flew by, filled with growth and happiness as I progressed. I soon received a call to serve a mission in Mexico. I quickly grew to love the language, the country, and its people. Sharing the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ gave me a foundation upon which to build the rest of my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/fellowshipping.p11\" class=\"\">I know what it means to have a friend, a responsibility, and to be nurtured by the good word of God. There are many that do not understand what is missing in their lives and hunger for those tender feelings that come from knowing the love of our Savior. They are good people who lie dormant, as it were, awaiting the awakening of their soul by those who bring the \u201cgood news.\u201d There are others who watch us, observe our examples, and say, \u201cI like what I see; how can I become a part of it?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/fellowshipping.p12\" class=\"\">I invite you brethren of the priesthood, both young and old, to look around you, seek out, and extend a warm hand of friendship to those less active and nonmembers.
