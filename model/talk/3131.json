I was more interested in watching them and many others of their kind than in watching the man on the flying trapeze. I looked at them in wonder as they alternately laughed and stared wide-eyed at the exciting things before them. And I thought of the miracle of children who become the world\u2019s constant renewal of life and purpose. Observing them in the intensity of their interest, even in this atmosphere, my mind reverted to that beautiful and touching scene recorded in the book of Third Nephi when the resurrected Lord took little children in his arms and wept as he blessed them and said to the people, \u201cBehold your little ones\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5881\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5881)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5881)\">3 Ne. 17:23<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p5\" class=\"\">It is so obvious that the great good and the terrible evil in the world today are the sweet and the bitter fruits of the rearing of yesterday\u2019s children. As we train a new generation, so will the world be in a few years. If you are worried about the future, then look to the upbringing of your children. Wisely did the writer of Proverbs declare, \u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41543\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41543)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41543)\">Prov. 22:6<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p6\" class=\"\">When I was a boy, we lived in the summer on a fruit farm. We grew great quantities of peaches\u2014carloads of them. Our father took us to tree pruning demonstrations put on by the Agricultural College. Each Saturday during January and February we would go out to the farm and prune the trees. We learned that by clipping and sawing in the right places, even when snow was on the ground and the wood appeared dead, we could shape a tree so that the sun would touch the fruit which was to come with spring and summer. We learned that in February we could pretty well determine the kind of fruit we would pick in September.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p7\" class=\"\">E. T. Sullivan once wrote these interesting words: \u201cWhen God wants a great work done in the world or a great wrong righted, he goes about it in a very unusual way. He doesn\u2019t stir up his earthquakes or send forth his thunderbolts. Instead, he has a helpless baby born, perhaps in a simple home out of some obscure mother. And then God puts the idea into the mother\u2019s heart, and she puts it into the baby\u2019s mind. And then God waits. The greatest forces in the world are not the earthquakes and the thunderbolts. The greatest forces in the world are babies.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Treasure Chest,<\/span> p. 53.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p8\" class=\"\">And those babies, I should like to add, will become forces for good or ill, depending in large measure on how they are reared.

That warmth, that love will bear sweet fruit in the years that follow. In large measure the harshness that characterizes so much of our society is an outgrowth of harshness imposed on children years ago.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p11\" class=\"\">When I met one of my childhood friends the other day, there came a train of memories of the neighborhood in which we grew up. It was a microcosm of the world, with many varieties of people. They were a close-knit group, and I think we knew them all. I think, also, we loved them all\u2014that is, except for one man. I must make a confession: I detested that man. I have since repented of that emotion, but as I look back, I can sense again the intensity of my feeling. His young boys were our friends, but he was my enemy. Why this strong antipathy? Because he whipped his children with strap or stick or whatever came to hand as his vicious anger flared on the slightest provocation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p12\" class=\"\">Perhaps it was because of the home in which I lived, where there was a father who, by some quiet magic, was able to discipline his family without the use of any instrument of punishment, though on occasion they may have deserved it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p13\" class=\"\">I have seen the fruits of that neighbor\u2019s temper come alive again in the troubled lives of his children. I have since discovered that he was one of that very substantial body of parents who seem incapable of anything but harshness toward those for whose coming into the world they are responsible. I have also come to realize that this man, who walks in the memories of my childhood, is but an example of tens of thousands in this land and uncounted thousands across the world who are known as child abusers. Every social worker, every duty officer in the emergency room of a large hospital, every policeman and judge in a large city can tell you of them. The whole tragic picture is one of beatings, kicking, slamming, and even of sexual assault on small children. And akin to these are those vicious men and women who exploit children for pornographic purposes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p14\" class=\"\">I have no disposition to dwell on this ugly picture. I wish only to say that no man who is a professed follower of Christ and no man who is a professed member of this church can engage in such practices without offending God and repudiating the teachings of his Son. It was Jesus himself who, while holding before us the example of the purity and innocence of children, declared, \u201cWhoso shall offend one of these little ones \u2026 , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36603\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36603)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36603)\">Matt. 18:6<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/behold-your-little-ones.p15\" class=\"\">Could there be a stronger denunciation of those who abuse children than these words spoken by the Savior of mankind?

But discipline with severity, discipline with cruelty, inevitably leads not to correction, but rather to resentment and bitterness. It cures nothing and only aggravates the problem.
