We acknowledge any and all who have had anything to do with the great work that has been done in this building. We especially thank the Presiding Bishopric\u2014Bishop H. David Burton, Bishop Richard C. Edgley, and Bishop Keith B. McMullin\u2014for their excellent leadership in directing the work of updating and restoring the Salt Lake Tabernacle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/salt-lake-tabernacle-rededication.p6\" class=\"\">I have fond memories as a boy coming to this Tabernacle. I was baptized here. When I became a deacon, my father brought me here to attend general priesthood meeting.

Both were built according to revelation. The first recorded Church-constructed building designated as a meetinghouse was also intended to be used as a schoolhouse. It was built of logs in Missouri in 1831.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-00605_000_017\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Richard W.

The Prophet Joseph Smith regretfully recorded that the building would not accommodate more.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-00605_000_017\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 2:410\u201311.]<\/span><\/sup> However, as violence against the Saints and their leaders escalated in Kirtland, the main body of the Church moved to Missouri in 1838, leaving this precious building behind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/salt-lake-tabernacle-rededication.p9\" class=\"\">The Nauvoo Temple followed essentially the same pattern as the Kirtland Temple with respect to the assembly rooms on the first and second floors. However, before the Nauvoo Temple was completed in 1846 the Saints would meet outside, often near the temple, to hear Joseph and the other Church leaders speak. Sometimes thousands attended those meetings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/salt-lake-tabernacle-rededication.p10\" class=\"\">As George A. Smith observed in his humorous way, \u201cIn the days of the Prophet Joseph \u2026 Mormonism flourished best out of doors.\u201d This was because \u201cwe failed to erect a building big enough to hold the Saints previous to the death of the Prophet.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-00605_000_017\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News,<\/span> Aug. 29, 1855, 194.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/salt-lake-tabernacle-rededication.p11\" class=\"\">Occasionally bad weather would interrupt those outdoor services, and both the speakers and congregation were uncomfortable. President Joseph F. Smith, who remembered well the discomfort of those outdoor meetings held near the temple in Nauvoo, said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/salt-lake-tabernacle-rededication.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cMy first recollection of a place of worship was in Nauvoo. It was in a little grove of trees near the site of the temple. In company with my mother I listened here to such men as Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, the Prophet Joseph and the Patriarch Hyrum. I remember quite well attending one meeting in this grove, that a wagon had been drawn up in front of the audience and the Prophet Joseph stood in the box speaking, when it began to rain. Some one or two persons got up and held umbrellas over him, to shield him from the wet. Many of the people had no umbrellas, and it was very annoying and disagreeable to sit there, but I remember very well, though but a little boy, that there was no one went away from the ground while he spoke.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-00605_000_017\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cThe Spirit of Worship,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> June 1910, 749\u201350.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/salt-lake-tabernacle-rededication.p13\" class=\"\">Before his death, the Prophet Joseph directed that a canvas tabernacle be built to shelter the Saints during large meetings.

As with other matters, such as the great migration to the West, Joseph Smith envisioned a great tabernacle, and Brigham Young made it a reality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/salt-lake-tabernacle-rededication.p18\" class=\"\">So the tabernacle contemplated for Nauvoo, although never built, was a prototype for this historic building.

This came about because of the inspiration that came to the Brethren to meet the needs of the people in our day and time. This is a good example of how the Lord makes it possible to meet the needs of the members of the Church. I testify that the Lord will continue to reveal through His prophet, Gordon B. Hinckley, the ways and means to meet the needs of all members in an ever-growing Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/salt-lake-tabernacle-rededication.p19\" class=\"\">I am grateful this magnificent building has been strengthened and renewed so it can continue to be used to instruct and edify the children of God.
