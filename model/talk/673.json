I have\nenjoyed the proceedings of this conference a very great deal. I feel that the Lord has been\nnear to us, and if we return to our fields of labor and observe the counsel and the advice that\nhas been given, it will prove to be a great uplift to the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nI earnestly pray that I might enjoy the spirit of the Lord during the few moments that I stand\nbefore you. It has been suggested that I say a few words on the missionary work of the\nChurch. Those of you who have attended the sessions of this conference will know that a\nnumber of the brethren have already spoken on this important subject. I cannot think of\nanything I would rather talk about. I love the missionary work. I have had the privilege of\nfilling four missions for the Church, and I just would not want to raise a boy and not have\nhim enjoy that opportunity, even though he might have to serve his country.\n<\/p><p>\nI wonder if we really appreciate the great importance of the missionary system of the Church.\nI have often said that to me it is the greatest organization or institution in the world&mdash;without\nit the kingdom could not be built. I was thinking about it this morning, and I wondered what\nthe Savior would say if he were here tonight and talking to this body of Priesthood, the\ninstruments in his hands for carrying on his work in the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nWe might ask him his opinion as to the importance of the work, something like this: \"Master,\nis it because you thought the missionary work was so very, very important that you started\nout the first few verses of your introduction to the revelations contained in the Doctrine and\nCovenants with a message on the missionary work?\" I preface what I want to say by reading\nthose few verses: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose\neyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon\nthe islands of the sea, listen together.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no\neye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be\npenetrated\" . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I\nhave chosen in these last days.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have commanded them\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13068\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13068)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13068)\">D&amp;C 1:1-2,4-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat is the beginning of the introduction to the Lord's revelations to guide his church and\nkingdom in this dispensation as he spake these words unto the Prophet Joseph Smith.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then we might say, \"Master when you bade your apostles farewell following your\nresurrection, was the importance of this missionary work indicated in your last command to\nthem &lsquo;Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature . . . and these signs\nshall follow them that believe . . . (and then he named the signs)\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33067\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33067)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33067)\">Mark 16:15-18<\/a><\/span>) and, lo, I am with you\nalway even unto the end of the world&rsquo;\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34606\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34606)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34606)\">Matt. 28:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to bear my testimony to you tonight, that my experience has taught me that the\nChrist has never rescinded that promise. Wherever the missionaries go, bearing his holy\nPriesthood, bearing witness of the truth, the Lord goes with them. He goes with them and fills\ntheir hearts to overflowing.\n<\/p><p>\nI have had many a letter from missionaries while president of a mission indicating that. I have\nan excerpt from a letter from a widow in the mission field in which she said that five souls\nwere about to be brought into the Church and the very thought of it filled\nher heart with such joy that she felt like it would burst, and then she added, \"such happiness I\nhave never known in my life.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIs it because the Lord promised that he would be with them unto the end of the world, and\nwe are approaching the end of the world, that a missionary can make a statement like one that\nI heard in Oregon a few weeks ago by a missionary who had just returned from his mission?\nHe came down with his fist on the pulpit and said, \"Brothers and sisters, I would not take a\ncheck for a million dollars today, for the experience of my mission.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIs it because the Lord is keeping his promise, \"And, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the\nend of the world,\" that when we meet for hours and hours, six and eight hours at a time, in\nthe mission field with a missionary group bearing their testimonies and reporting their work,\nthat there is often not a dry eye there? Is it because the Savior has made good his promise\nthat he is with them? After all, he creates the feelings of the human breast, and as I have\noften said, he is the best paymaster in all the world. His servants are better paid, without their\nsalaries, than others who are paid large salaries for preaching.\n<\/p><p>\nI heard President Grant say in Europe, when he was president of the European Mission, that\nnotwithstanding the years he had served as an apostle in the Church, the greatest joy he had\never had in his ministry was in the mission field. And after we had met in a Priesthood\nmeeting at Rotterdam for a whole day, because he brought a hundred missionaries with him\nout of England, and each one had had an opportunity to speak, and there had not been a dry\neye there, he turned to us missionaries and said, \"Now, brethren, today we have feasted on the\nfat things of the spirit of the Lord. Now go out,\" he said, \"and give it away, give it to the\npeople, the more you give away, the more you will have left.\" Is it not wonderful? I have\nbeen in missionary meetings where I felt like I was lifted up into another world, and that\nshould I open my eyes I could see the angels of heaven there. That, to me, is an evidence of\nhow the Lord values this work.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen he stood upon the Mount of Olives and told his disciples that the temple should be\nbroken down and not one stone should be left upon another, they enquired of him saying,\n\"Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end\nof the world?\" He told them of the coming of wars and rumors of wars and tempests and\nearthquakes and so forth, and then he said, \"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached\nin all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34595\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34595)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34595)\">Matt. 24:2,14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd how shall it be preached? Paul said that \"faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the\nword of God.\" And how shall they hear except it be preached unto them, and how shall it be\npreached, except they be sent (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42709\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42709)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42709)\">Rom. 10:14-17<\/a><\/span>).\nSo, if the Master is to come and claim his\nkingdom, the Gospel must be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.\n<\/p><p>\nIs it because this missionary work is so important in his mind that when He said to one,\n\"Follow me, But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father,\" Jesus, as if he\nwould say to the Priesthood of his Church, that they should not find excuses not to preach the\nkingdom, said, \"Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.\"\nAnd then \"another also said, Lord I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell\nwhich are at home at my house, and Jesus said unto him, No man having put his hand to the\nplough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31330\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31330)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31330)\">Luke 9:59-62<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then he sent the Seventy out. Is it because the work is so important that he said unto\nthem: \"The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the\nharvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31333\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31333)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31333)\">Luke 10:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd, brethren, in this dispensation, when men were first converted to the Church they went to\nthe Prophet Joseph to find out through him from the Lord what thing they should do that\nwould be the most pleasing unto the Lord and almost invariably the answer came back from\nthe Lord through the Prophet of this dispensation, that they should thrust in their sickles and\nreap because the harvest was white already to be garnered, and then he added, and if it so be\nthat ye shall labor all your days and bring save one soul unto me, how great shall be your\nreward in the kingdom of my Father\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13082\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13082)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13082)\">D&amp;C 14:1-11<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13086\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13086)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13086)\">D&amp;C 15:1-6<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13087\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13087)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13087)\">D&amp;C 18:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI have thought of that promise and have reached the conclusion that I would not exchange the\nfriendships that have been mine with those whom I have had the privilege of bringing into\nthis Church, with the help of the Lord, as one of his missionaries, for all the wealth of this\nworld. When the Lord said, \"If you bring save one soul unto me how great shall be your joy,\"\nI never realized just what that meant until I had a letter from a man from Phoenix while I was\npresident of the Southern States Mission, in which he indicated that his father was one of the\nfirst converts out of the State of Mississippi back in 1840, and said \"Since that time my\nfather's own descendants have given 100 years of missionary service to this Church,\" and\nthere were 15 then in the mission-field, and we had three of them. I told that story here in the\nBarratt Hall at a Missionary Conference in 1940, just 100 years after that man had been\ngathered into the fold by the efforts of a missionary, and this good brother happened to be\npresent, and at the close of the meeting he came up and said \"Brother Richards, it is now 160\nyears.\" When you get to adding 15 or 20 years, a year, it soon runs into figures.\n<\/p><p>\nThink of the young missionary who might have traveled through the swamps of Mississippi in\nthose early days, when many of the missionaries contracted the malaria fever, and if he only\nbrought, say, this one soul into the Church, he might have felt that his labors had been in\nvain. But in 100 years time there are 160 years of missionary service from the descendants of\nthat one man, alone not counting all the converts they had made, and their converts, and their\nconverts, until you would have, literally an empire of people who had joined the Church\nbecause this missionary brought this one man into the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIs it because of the importance of this great missionary work that when the Savior asked the\ntwelve Nephite disciples what thing they desired at his hands, all but three expressed the\ndesire that they might live to the allotted age of man, and then come unto him in his\nkingdom, but three of them hesitated, and he told them that he perceived that their desire was\nthe same as that of his Apostle John, that they might tarry to bring souls unto him, until he\nshould come in his kingdom and for this desire he commended them.\n<\/p><p>\nHe indicated that the desire of the nine was good, but the desire of the three was a greater\ndesire, to have in their hearts a desire to bring souls unto him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5528\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5528)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5528)\">3 Ne. 28:1-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, I feel that every man who bears the priesthood of God should desire to contribute to\nthe missionary work of this Church. I think every father in Israel ought to raise his boys with\na desire to be missionaries. When we think of the blessings that we have, the priesthood that\nwe bear, it is worth more than all the wealth and the success of the world. Why should we\nnot want to share with those who know not the truth and make it possible for them to enjoy\nthe glorious blessings that are ours which we enjoy as members of this Church.\n<\/p><p>\nI remind you of the story that President Grant used to tell about the good Scandinavian\nbrother who came to Utah. He had not been taught very much about the Gospel, but he loved\nit. The bishop went to him and taught him the law of tithing, and he paid his tithing; he\ntaught him the fast offering, and he paid his fast offering; and then he went\nto get a contribution for the erection of a meeting house, and the brother did not know why\nthat could not be taken out of the tithing, but before the bishop got through with him, he paid\nhis contribution for the meeting house; and then the bishop went to him to get his son to go\non a mission and the brother said, \"That is the straw that breaks the camel's back. He is our\nonly child. We just can't let him go.\" And then the bishop countered, \"Brother so-and-so,\nwhom do you love in this world more than anyone else outside of your immediate family?\"\nAnd he thought a minute, then he said, \"I guess I love that young missionary who came up to\nthe Land of the Midnight Sun and taught me the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.\" And then\nthe bishop countered, \"How would you like someone to love your boy just like you love that\nboy?\" \"Yes,\" he said \"Bishop, you win again. Take him.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I went on my first mission, President Anthon H. Lund told us missionaries that the\npeople over there would love us. \"Now don't get lifted up in the pride of your hearts,\" he\nsaid, \"and think that they love you because you are better than others, they will love you\nbecause of your calling, and the Spirit of the Lord that rests upon you.\" I did not know just\nwhat Brother Lund meant by that, but when I went to leave Holland to return home, I shed a\nlot more tears than I did when I left my loved ones to go to Holland. I went to one home;\nand a man old enough to be my father, in the government service all of his life, with a long\nbeard, knelt down on the ground and took my hand in his and hugged it and kissed it and\nbathed it with his tears, and then I knew what Brother Lund meant, and then I went into\nanother home where the woman said, with the tears rolling down her cheeks, \"Brother\nRichards, it was hard to see my daughter leave for Zion a few weeks ago, but it is much\nharder to see you go.\" And then I realized what Brother Lund really meant, that they should\nlove us because of the Spirit that we take with us into the world.\n<\/p><p>\nI feel that every father in Israel ought to want to see his boy go on a mission, and if he has\nnot been himself, I think he ought to want to go, or else help with the stake missionary work.\nI think we all ought to want to have to our credit, when a count is finally taken, that we have\ndone something in the great missionary cause of this Church.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay threw out a challenge to us in the temple at Logan the other day, that each\none of us ought to try and bring one soul into the Church during the next year. If every\nmember of this Church would try and do that just think what a harvest there would be, and\nwhen you stop to think about it, here in this stake missionary work, we have all of our\nbuildings to offer to our friends, we have a great program. I think now of a man who came\ninto my office a few months ago. He was here from Michigan with his family, and he said,\n\"Bishop, how can I get my family into your Church. I have seen so much and heard so much\nabout your activities for youth, and we do not have any,\" he said, \"and I must have my\nchildren enjoying these things.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, right here in our midst, if we will just carry the message to our neighbors and our\nfriends, many of them will join the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nSince the close of the afternoon meeting, I visited with a man for nearly an hour in my office.\nHe lived in one of our towns here in Utah for three years and no one ever offered him the\nGospel or told him anything about it or invited him to come to one of our meetings, and then\nhe moved off down to California and years later he got into a good man's office who gave\nhim a book to read and now he is an Elder in this Church.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not know whether this story is true or not, but it is a good story, and I like to tell it, and\nI heard it when I was young. The story is told of an Englishman who bought a farm up here\nin Davis County, he was not a member of the Church and all around him\nwere Mormons, but, you know when they met this Englishman neighbor they did not want to\nimpose their religion upon him and so they passed the time of day and talked about current\nevents, and finally one of the neighbors was called on a mission to Great Britain, and while\nhe was there, his English friend decided to go back and visit his relatives in England, and\nwhile there he picked up a newspaper one evening and read an announcement of a Mormon\nConference to be held and everybody invited and no collection&mdash;you know how that goes.\n\"Well,\" he said, to himself, \"after living out there among them for all this time, I do not know\na thing about what they believe. I guess I had better go and listen to them.\" So he went, and\nto his surprise the principal speaker that evening was his neighbor from next door, from over\nin Davis County, and he had to go all the way back to Great Britain to get that neighbor to\ntell him of the marvelous work and a wonder the Lord had set his hand to do in our day.\n<\/p><p>\nI met a Stake Mission President in one of our stakes outside of Utah, and learned that he was\na convert to the Church; that he had lived in Salt Lake City for twelve years, but he had\nnever attended one of our meetings, nor did he join the Church until he moved away, and the\nmissionaries contacted him. I said, \"Why didn't you join when you were in Salt Lake?\" He\nsaid, \"No one ever invited me.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, I hope that right here at home we will do some good missionary work. You bishops,\ndon't be too stingy in giving these mission presidents the help they need, where you have\nnonmembers living within the confines of your stake. Some of these stakes are going to be\ncomparable to our foreign missions through the missionary work that is being done and the\nspirit of missionary work that is coming into the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a great loss to a man to miss the experience of a mission. It is a great loss to a home to\nmiss having their boys go on missions. A short time ago one of our mission presidents\nreported that they had eighteen missionaries come into their mission out of homes where the\nparents were not active in the Church, but in a short time, in fifteen of those homes the\nparents had become active, so that the missionary work is not done only with the ones we\nmeet in the mission-field, but in our own homes, in the lives of the missionaries, in the\ncommunities in which we reside, the wards and stakes we help to lift the spirituality by the\nmissionary work that is rendered in these wards and in these stakes.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are also trying to reach out to what we call the minority groups. I like the spirit that\nBrother Kimball has with these Lamanites. I believe it is because of the importance of this\ngreat missionary work that he loves them like he does. I was in a stake president's home not\nso long ago, and there was a picture of his missionary boy on the piano, and I said, \"Where is\nhe laboring?\" And the wife said \"Down among the Indians.\" And I hardly dared ask the next\nquestion, I was afraid. Finally, I got up courage and said, \"How is he enjoying it?\" \"Oh,\nBishop,\" she said, \"He thinks they are wonderful. He is even talking of going back to live\nthere when he gets released from his mission.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI think that is what the Lord meant when he said, \"And, lo, I will be with you alway even\nuntil the end of the world\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34607\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34607)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34607)\">Matt. 28:20<\/a><\/span>).\nHe plants that love in their hearts.\n<\/p><p>\nI heard a young girl reporting her mission among the Indians just recently and she just wept\nwhen she told of the souls of those women among whom she had labored. We might not have\nthought that they were worth saving. And so we have the Indians and the Mexicans and the\nChinese and the Japanese and other races of people here in our midst, and remember the Lord\nsaid, \"And this Gospel of the Kingdom should be preached in all the world for a witness unto\nall nations\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34599\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34599)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34599)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd when John saw the angel flying in the midst of heaven with the\neverlasting Gospel, it was to be preached to every nation, every kindred, every tongue, and\nevery people (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42240\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42240)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42240)\">Rev. 14:6-7<\/a><\/span>).\nDoes that leave anybody out? If not that is a part of the great\nmissionary responsibility that we bear to the world.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear you my testimony that it is one of the sweetest experiences that can come, and I hope\nthat even our boys who have been in the armed forces will not be robbed of the privilege of\ngoing on missions. I think the bishops ought to interview them all, and if they are worthy,\ngive them an opportunity and even if they cannot go, they will feel drawn to the Church\nbecause they have been invited.\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to say in parting to the bishops, do not just sit in your offices and decide that\nboys cannot afford to go on missions. I will tell you a story that was told to me. A good\nbrother, a friend of mine, who aims to keep a missionary in the field all the time, decided to\ngo to a poor section of the city and see if the bishop would like to furnish him a missionary,\nso he said, \"Do you have a young man that you think would like to go on a mission and you\nhave not called him because you did not think he would have the money?\" The bishop said,\n\"We have just such a man as that.\" My friend said, \"Well, you talk to him about it.\" So the\nbishop went to him and when he told this young man that he wanted him to go on a mission,\nthe young man's face lighted up and he said, \"Bishop, I have the money in the savings bank\nfor my mission. I have been waiting two years for you to tell me you would like me to go on\na mission.\" I wonder how many men in Israel there are who have waited on their bishops and\nthe call never came.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to arise to the importance of this great missionary work, I humbly pray, and\nleave my love and blessings with you all, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
