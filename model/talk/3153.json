I am certain and bear the witness, by applying the principle just stated by Brother McConkie, that the calling which has come to me and my colleagues in the last two days is as much the inspiration of the Lord as was my call thirty-three years ago. I should like you to know that.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/he-hath-showed-thee-o-man-what-is-good.p4\" class=\"\">In this day of mechanical marvels my mind harkens back to the days of my childhood.

This particular ward was one of the gathering places for members from Denmark. The bishop, Heber C. Iverson, could speak their language. In fast day meetings, testimonies were often unintelligible to me as the Saints struggled to testify in English, their new tongue. In Sunday School the room was divided into classrooms by green curtains hanging from wires overhead. If I was not interested in what my teacher was saying, I could choose from five other classes, all of which I could hear. It was always interesting to try to solve the problem of the identity of the boy who kept poking me in the back through the curtain at my rear.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/he-hath-showed-thee-o-man-what-is-good.p6\" class=\"\">Even in those early years I somehow grasped the idea that I alone must work out my salvation, and that I could not blame anyone else if I didn\u2019t. Today I cannot identify the exact teaching of this principle, but I suspect that it came from those testimonies I heard in the Second Ward, the Sunday School class, my parents, and the repetition of the second Article of Faith [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6950\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6950)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6950)\">A of F 1:2<\/a><\/span>], which I repeated many times in that day. This article states: \u201cWe believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam\u2019s transgression.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/he-hath-showed-thee-o-man-what-is-good.p7\" class=\"\">I made an early resolve to be good and thus escape the punishment. The word <span class=\"emphasis\">punish<\/span> was also quite common. My father and mother used it to explain to me why I was being spanked, both before the event and after. I grew up with the sure knowledge that I was responsible for my own acts of good and evil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/he-hath-showed-thee-o-man-what-is-good.p8\" class=\"\">I have come to know that the acts of men, once governed by the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount, are in my day to a great extent governed by the whims of the persons committing the act. The excuse is that one has to \u201cdo his own thing.\u201d And apparently the commandments are forgotten. But they have not been cancelled. They still stand as a beacon light on the way to eternal life\u2014which is, of course, eternal happiness and joy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">The stern, short statements of the Ten Commandments have always held me in awe.

Anyone who ever heard her sing those words was lifted into resolve to make his life conform to the teaching. In the words from Psalm 24 the Psalmist first asks two questions: \u201cWho shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?\u201d The answer comes with startling simplicity: \u201cHe that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.\u201d Then comes the promise: \u201cHe shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41953\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41953)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41953)\">Ps. 24:3\u20135<\/a><\/span>.)
