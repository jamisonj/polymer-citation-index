Let your voice help fulfill Moroni\u2019s prophetic words to speak good of the Prophet. Here are two ideas: First, find scriptures in the Book of Mormon that you feel and know are absolutely true. Then share them with family and friends in family home evening, seminary, and your Young Men and Young Women classes, acknowledging that Joseph was an instrument in God\u2019s hands. Next, read the testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Pearl of Great Price or in this pamphlet, now in 158 languages. You can find it online at LDS.org or with the missionaries. This is Joseph\u2019s own testimony of what actually occurred. Read it often. Consider recording the testimony of Joseph Smith in your own voice, listening to it regularly, and sharing it with friends. Listening to the Prophet\u2019s testimony in your own voice will help bring the witness you seek.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/joseph-smith.p41\" class=\"\" id=\"p41\">There are great and wonderful days ahead.
