I don't\nbelieve many of the people who use that phrase have any very clear idea about what they\nmean by it. It sounds good, seeming to imply a penetrating insight into the portent of the\ntimes, no matter how nebulous or muddy the thinking behind it may be, so it is freely used.\n<\/p><p>\nBut I don't want to talk about that. A companion phrase is that we can't go back&mdash;we'll never\ngo back to things as they were before. Well, the man who finds himself finally hanged on the\ngallows is the man who, when he got started off wrong, wouldn't go back. My judgment is\nthat when we get started on the wrong way the sooner we turn back the better. The whole\ndoctrine of repentance assumes a turning back from wrong to right.\n<\/p><p>\nBut I don't want to go into that, either. I merely want to remind you that, amid all the\nchanges in an ever-changing world there are some immutable things which do not change.\nThey are as steadfast and unchanging as the heavens, which are the same now as when the\nfirst man looked out upon them. They are the basis of the moral order of the world which is\nthe foundation upon which our civilization itself is built. The task of today is to preserve,\nthough all else change, man's allegiance, unshaken, to those eternal foundations.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Ten Commandments (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50098\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50098)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50098)\">Ex. 20:3-17<\/a><\/span>),\nfor instance. They cannot be abrogated without abrogating the\nmoral order of the world, shaking down the very foundations upon which our civilization\nrests. They set forth the law of life and can never be outmoded or rendered obsolete while life\nendures. They are of just as much binding force today as they were on the day when they\nwere spoken with the voice of thunder out of the clouds on Sinai. They can no more be\nviolated without disastrous consequences than one can violate any law governing in the\nphysical world without being visited with the inescapable penalty.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I listened to the powerful message of the Presidency, delivered this morning, I was\nimpressed with the importance of that idea. From that message, if we were attentive to it, we\nlearned that as to basic things there is no middle ground. Either we live by them or we pay\nthe penalty of departure from their inexorable commands. They are not subject to\nmodification or interpretation, but stand wholly as given, to be accepted in whole and lived\ncompletely.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the same with the basic things upon which we have rested our faith. Either a thing is, or\nit is not. To illustrate: This Church is founded upon the proposition that Jesus Christ is the\nSon of God, that through His mediation it became possible for us to attain immortality and\neternal life. We cannot deviate from that. He is the Son of the Living God, the author of our\nsalvation (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24203\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24203)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24203)\">Heb. 5:9<\/a><\/span>),\nand must be accepted in that light solely and completely. The whole structure of\nour own Church revolves about that basic fact. We say that the God of heaven came down in\nanswer to the prayer of a boy and that He brought with Him a personage whom He\nintroduced as His son, and He commanded that praying boy to hear His Son\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30209\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30209)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30209)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>). And out of the\nteachings which were then given, and followed up by subsequent instructions, this Church was\nestablished. Now, that admits of no explanation, of no modification. Either those things\nhappened or they did not happen. There is no middle ground; and if they did not happen then\nwe have nothing, because our whole structure is foundationed upon that assumed fact. We\naccept it as a fact, and we may not temporize with it, try to explain it away, modify it, or\nliberalize about it. It stands as the basic thing upon which our whole faith is founded. And\nour whole system of belief exacts of us that we accept those basic truths, without modification\nor change. As with the moral order of the world so those things may not be changed. They\nare as binding today as when they were first declared by the voice of God out of the heavens,\nand they will never change.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God grant that we may hold steadfastly to them and that we may order our lives so that\nwe shall not find occasions to depart from them, I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
