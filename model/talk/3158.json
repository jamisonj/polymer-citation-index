Explaining the intended outcomes of the welfare plan, President J.

Only when achieved individually can it have its intended influence on family units and the whole body of the Church. Just as each individual\u2019s testimony adds to the strength of the Church, so also does the individual labor of each member comprise the power of unified welfare services.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/the-fruit-of-our-welfare-services-labors.p15\" class=\"\">You may ask, \u201cHow do I secure these blessings and what seeds must I sow in order to reap the fruits thereof?\u201d I believe they are found in personal, daily application of the six foundational principles of welfare services: love, service, work, self-reliance, consecration, and stewardship. The entire welfare activity structure, and for that matter the full program of the Church, provides ample opportunity for application of these principles.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/the-fruit-of-our-welfare-services-labors.p16\" class=\"\">We have said that <span class=\"emphasis\">welfare services is the gospel in action.<\/span> This implies that we achieve the fruits of welfare service not just by knowing these six principles and related gospel doctrine, but by doing, working, and putting into practice what we have been taught.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/the-fruit-of-our-welfare-services-labors.p17\" class=\"\">Often, however, some seek the fruits without the planting.

There are far too few who are willing to pay the price, in discipline and work, to cultivate hardy roots. Such cultivation should begin in our youth. Little did I know as a boy that daily chores in the garden, feeding the cattle, carrying the water, chopping the wood, mending fences, and all the labor of a small farm was an important part of sending down roots, before being called on to send out branches. I\u2019m so grateful that my parents understood the relationship between roots and branches.

We all have challenges, heartaches, and experience success and failures. It is from these that we grow, gain strength and experience while in mortality.

We are conscious of the considerable sacrifice and diligence of the Relief Society sisters, who for over a century have faithfully discharged this sacred wheat trust. We are confident that the Welfare Services Department, under the direction of the General Welfare Services Committee, which is composed of the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, the Presiding Bishopric, and the Relief Society General Presidency, will continue wheat reserves management in the same fine manner in which it has been operated by the Relief Society in the past. We will see that the Relief Society gift is used, as has been intended, for a time of need to bless the lives of Church members everywhere worldwide.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/the-fruit-of-our-welfare-services-labors.p62\" class=\"\">We are proud of the accomplishments of the women in the past and the present. Now we ask you sisters to continue in your good works and to support the programs of the Church, particularly those of your own organization, the Relief Society.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/the-fruit-of-our-welfare-services-labors.p63\" class=\"\">We ask you also to support the Brethren, and we ask them to support you and to work together as partners and companions in furthering the work of the Lord and your own salvation. Let this gift from the Relief Society today be an example of the cooperative effort and harmony that can enrich our lives in the Church and in the home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/the-fruit-of-our-welfare-services-labors.p64\" class=\"\">May the Lord bless us in this great and divinely inspired welfare work, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ.
