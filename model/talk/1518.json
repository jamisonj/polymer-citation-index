Honesty is as basic to true Christianity as baptism or the resurrection of\nthe dead. It is the foundation of all character development. Just as no man can see the\nkingdom of heaven without baptism, as explained by the Savior (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28227\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28227)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28227)\">John 3:3-5<\/a><\/span>), so it may be said with equal\ntruth that no dishonest man, except he repents, can see the kingdom of heaven.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>. . . to civilization<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOur Christian civilization is built upon integrity. Without it our way of life would collapse. If\nwe allow dishonesty to weave itself into the fabric of our lives, we invite moral suicide.\n<\/p><p>\nDishonesty in the world is appalling. The cost of major crime is shocking in the extreme, but\npetty crime involving far more people is becoming a national disgrace. It is almost incredible\nthat here in the United States, for example, shoplifting costs our stores nearly three billion\ndollars a year. Most shoplifters are women and children.\n<\/p><p>\nOther types of petty crime cost American businessmen an additional billion dollars annually.\n<\/p><p>\nOne hotel in New York last year lost 18,000 towels, 355 silver coffee pots, 15,000\nfingerbowls, and 100 Bibles.\n<\/p><p>\nSeventy-five percent of all insurance claims are estimated to be dishonest, costing insurance\ncompanies 350 million dollars a year in overpayments. Cheating in school is admitted by\nhosts of our students.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd yet, lest we think that dishonesty is completely engulfing us, we should recall that\ndepartment stores, for example, when reporting on their charge accounts, say that the rate of\ndefault is less than 2 percent. Last year fewer than 2,000 people out of 102 million taxpayers\nwere indicted for income tax fraud. It is estimated by revenue officials that 95 percent of all\nincome is reported to the government. So said the September 9 issue of <i>Time<\/i> magazine.\n<\/p><p>\nIn a recent <i>Look<\/i> magazine survey of teenagers, it was most heartening to note that these\nyoung people said they want to live honestly in what they call \"this dishonest world.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe claim to be a Christian people. But to what extent have true Christian principles become a\npart of our lives?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Conduct shows faith<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAre our daily habits indicative of a genuine Christian conversion?\n<\/p><p>\nIs our personal conduct a reflection of Christlike virtues?\n<\/p><p>\nCan any professed Christian be a Christian indeed if he is not honest?\n<\/p><p>\nWhat is the gospel for&mdash;merely to talk about?\n<\/p><p>\nOr is it something to <i>live<\/i>, to incorporate in our daily conduct?\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior said it is to assist us to become perfect in all we do, as perfect as God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35544\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35544)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35544)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen is there any place for deceit in a true Christian life?\n<\/p><p>\nIs not dishonesty an apostasy from Christ to the extent of our misbehavior?\n<\/p><p>\nCan we have a living faith in Christ without doing his works?\n<\/p><p>\nTo profess belief in him and yet refuse to live his laws seems to be a dishonest act in itself.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>No Christian life without honesty<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Christian religion cannot be separated from the Christian life, and there can be no\nChristian life without honesty.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Savior told us to love our
