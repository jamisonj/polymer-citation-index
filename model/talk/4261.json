President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., was such a man. Time and again, his fervent plea was for the priesthood of God to be united. Citing the teachings of Jesus, he inevitably admonished us, \u201cBe one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18423\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18423)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18423)\">D&amp;C 38:27<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-call-of-duty.p4\" class=\"\">It was my great privilege to know President Clark rather well. I was his printer. On occasion, he would share with me some of his most intimate thoughts, even those scriptures around which he tailored his teachings and lived his life. Late one evening I delivered some press proofs to his office situated in his home at 80 D Street here in Salt Lake City. President Clark was reading from Ecclesiastes. He was in a quiet and reflective mood. He sat back from his large desk, which was stacked with books and papers. He held the scriptures in his hand, lifted his eyes from the printed page, and read aloud to me: \u201cLet us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21447\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21447)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21447)\">Eccl. 12:13<\/a><\/span>.)

President George Albert Smith, that modest yet effective leader, declared, \u201cIt is your duty first of all to learn what the Lord wants and then by the power and strength of your holy priesthood to so magnify your calling in the presence of your fellows that the people will be glad to follow you.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Church News,<\/span> 7 Sept. 1968, p. 15.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-call-of-duty.p31\" class=\"\">What does it mean to magnify a calling? It means to build it up in dignity and importance, to make it honorable and commendable in the eyes of all men, to enlarge and strengthen it, to let the light of heaven shine through it to the view of other men. And how does one magnify a calling? Simply by performing the service that pertains to it. An elder magnifies the ordained calling of an elder by learning what his duties as an elder are and then by doing them. As with an elder, so with a deacon, a teacher, a priest, a bishop, and each who holds office in the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-call-of-duty.p32\" class=\"\">In 1950 the call of duty came to me as a bishop. The responsibilities were many and varied. The Doctrine and Covenants provided a sure guide. The words of the Apostle Paul to Timothy pertaining to the office of a bishop were sobering. The <span class=\"emphasis\">General Handbook<\/span> was helpful. The principal areas of administration were spelled out by leaders, both stake and general: The bishop (1) is the father of the ward; (2) is the president of the Aaronic Priesthood; (3) provides for the poor, the needy; (4) is responsible for keeping proper records; and (5) is the common judge in Israel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-call-of-duty.p33\" class=\"\">Then came an unusual assignment from Church headquarters. Bishops were to provide each serviceman a subscription to the <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News<\/span> and the <span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era<\/span> and were to write a personal letter to every serviceman each month. The Korean War was raging. Our ward had twenty-three members in uniform. The priesthood quorums, with effort, supplied the funds for the subscriptions to the publications. Since I had served in the Navy in World War II, I knew the importance of a letter from home. I began the task, even the duty, to write twenty-three personal letters each month. After all these years, I still have copies of many of my letters and the responses received. Tears come easily when these letters are reread. It is a joy to learn again of a soldier\u2019s pledge to live the gospel, a sailor\u2019s decision to keep faith with his family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-call-of-duty.p34\" class=\"\">One evening I handed to a lady in the ward the stack of twenty-three letters for the current month. Her assignment was to handle the mailing and to maintain the constantly changing address file. She glanced at one envelope and, with a smile, asked, \u201cBishop, don\u2019t you ever get discouraged? Here is another letter to Brother Bryson. This is the seventeenth letter you have sent to him without a reply.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/the-call-of-duty.p35\" class=\"\">I responded, \u201cWell, maybe this will be the month.\u201d And it was. His reply is a keepsake, a literal treasure. It was postmarked \u201cAPO San Francisco.\u201d He was serving far away on a distant shore, isolated, homesick, alone. He wrote: \u201cDear Bishop, I ain\u2019t much at writin\u2019 letters. [I could have told him that seventeen months earlier.] Thank you for the <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News<\/span> and magazines, but most of all thank you for the personal letters.
