During the appointment, President Clegg would mention the temple of the Lord, the saving ordinances and covenants emphasized there, and would conclude with this question: \u201cWouldn\u2019t you desire to take your sweet wife and your precious children to the house of the Lord, that you might be a forever family throughout the eternities?\u201d An acknowledgment followed, the reactivation process was pursued, and the goal was achieved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/stand-in-your-appointed-place.p26\" class=\"\">In 1952 the majority of the families in the Rose Park Third Ward were members whose fathers or husbands held only the Aaronic Priesthood, rather than the Melchizedek Priesthood.

He invited a less-active brother in the ward, Ernest Skinner, to assist in activating the 29 adult brethren in the ward who held the office of teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood and to help these men and their families get to the temple. As a less-active member himself, Brother Skinner was reluctant at first but finally indicated he would do what he could. He began personally visiting with the less-active adult teachers, trying to help them see their role as priesthood leaders in their homes and as husbands and fathers to their families. He soon enlisted some of the less-active brethren to assist him in his assignment.

With a wry smile, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m now second counselor in my ward bishopric. Your invitation to come out to church, and my negative response, so haunted me that I determined to do something about it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/stand-in-your-appointed-place.p47\" class=\"\">Harold and I visited together on numerous occasions before he passed away. The Gallachers and their children filled many callings in the Church. One of the youngest grandchildren is now serving a full-time mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/stand-in-your-appointed-place.p48\" class=\"\">To the many missionaries who may be listening this evening, I share the observation that the seeds of testimony frequently do not immediately take root and flower. Bread cast upon the water returns, at times, only after many days. But it does return.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/stand-in-your-appointed-place.p49\" class=\"\">I answered the ring of my telephone one evening to hear a voice ask, \u201cAre you related to an Elder Monson who years ago served in the New England Mission?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/stand-in-your-appointed-place.p50\" class=\"\">I answered that such was not the case. The caller introduced himself as a Brother Leonardo Gambardella and then mentioned that an Elder Monson and an Elder Bonner called at his home long ago and bore their testimonies to him and his wife. They had listened but had done nothing further to apply their teachings. Subsequently they moved to California, where, some 13 years later, they again found the truth and were converted and baptized. Brother Gambardella then asked if there were any way he could reach the elders who first had visited with them, that he might express his profound gratitude for their testimonies, which had remained with him and his wife.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/stand-in-your-appointed-place.p51\" class=\"\">I checked the records. I located the elders. Can you imagine their surprise when, now married with families of their own, I telephoned them and told them the good news\u2014even the culmination of their early efforts. They instantly remembered the Gambardellas. I arranged a conference telephone call so they could personally extend their congratulations and welcome them into the Church. They did. There were tears, but they were tears of joy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/stand-in-your-appointed-place.p52\" class=\"\">Edwin Markham penned these lines:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">There is a destiny that makes us brothers;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">None goes his way alone:<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">All that we send into the lives of others<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Comes back into our own.<\/span>\n\t    <sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote16-23905_000_022\">16<\/a>\n\t   <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cA Creed,\u201d in James Dalton, ed., <span class=\"emphasis\">Masterpieces of Religious Verse<\/span> (1948), 464.]<\/span><\/sup><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/stand-in-your-appointed-place.p57\" class=\"\">Tonight I pray that all of us who hold the priesthood may sense our responsibilities, that we, like Gideon of old, may stand every man in his appointed place and, as one, follow our Leader\u2014even the Lord Jesus Christ\u2014and His prophet, President Gordon B.
