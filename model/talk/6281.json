Many years ago, while serving as a bishop, I felt impressed to call upon Augusta Schneider, a widow from the Alsace-Lorraine area of Europe who spoke very little English, although she was fluent in French and German. For years after that first impression I would visit with her at Christmastime. On one occasion, Augusta said, \u201cBishop, I have something of great value to me which I would like to present to you.\u201d She then went to a special place in her modest apartment and retrieved the gift. It was a beautiful piece of felt, perhaps six by eight inches in size, to which she had pinned the medals her husband had been presented for his service as a member of the French forces in World War I. She said, \u201cI would like you to have this personal treasure which is so close to my heart.\u201d I protested politely and suggested there must be some member of her extended family to whom the gift should be given. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied firmly, \u201cthe gift is yours, for you have the soul of a Frenchman.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/becoming-our-best-selves.p40\" class=\"\">Shortly after presenting this special gift to me, Augusta departed mortality and went home to that God who gave her life.
