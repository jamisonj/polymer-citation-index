He has indicated that we must lengthen our stride and that he wants us to double the number of missionaries that we have. I think I have been a missionary all my life\u2014ever since I was a small boy. I remember one of the first books that I read as a boy that impressed me was the <span class=\"emphasis\">Life of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/span> by George Q. Cannon. That book made such an impression upon my mind and caused me in my heart to have such a love for the Prophet Joseph and such a testimony of the truth of his story that I have felt I wanted to tell it to all the world ever since that time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p6\" class=\"\">I was very much thrilled with President Kimball\u2019s closing remarks in our meeting last Thursday with the Regional Representatives of the Twelve, for he said that he looks for the day when we will bring in thousands of converts. Then I said to myself: Why not? We have the greatest message in all this world. The message we have for the world today is just as important in the sight of the Lord for all of his children as the message was that Peter delivered on the day of Pentecost, when the multitudes were pricked in their hearts and they cried out: \u201cMen and brethren, what shall we do?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8185\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8185)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8185)\">Acts 2:37<\/a><\/span>.)

If Paul were here, to which church would he go, for he said there is \u201cone Lord, one faith, one baptism.\u201d And so we have to look for divine guidance to know where to go to find that true church if there is only to be one church, and that is our testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p14\" class=\"\">Our message to the world today is the restoration of the gospel.

Now that is quite a statement, but Paul was not at all backward in indicating what he thought of those who didn\u2019t teach the truth that had come to them through the Savior and his teachings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p15\" class=\"\">Now I realize, as I stand here today before this great multitude and all those who are listening in on television and radio, that I will come under the condemnation that Paul spoke of if I am not preaching the same gospel that Paul preached; but I bear witness to you today that we have the only true, living church upon the face of the earth that the Lord recognizes that has divine authority to administer the saving ordinances of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p16\" class=\"\">Great was the day when the Church was organized in the days of the Savior, but it is more glorious when the final or finishing touches are added. Of course, we couldn\u2019t have that without the great redemption work that he wrought. But Paul saw \u201cthat in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21874\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21874)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21874)\">Eph. 1:10<\/a><\/span>.)

We are in the dispensation of the fulness of times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p17\" class=\"\">It was a glorious thing when the Savior, following his resurrection, ascended to heaven in the presence of 500 of the brethren, and two men in white apparel said: \u201cYe men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8184\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8184)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8184)\">Acts 1:11<\/a><\/span>.)

In other words, if he were to establish his work in the earth in the latter days, in that dispensation of the fulness of times, in order to bring together in one in Christ all that which is in heaven above and that which is in the earth beneath, he would have to have a prophet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p19\" class=\"\">There has never been a time, when God has had a work in the earth, that he has recognized without a prophet at its head. We sing in our song, \u201cWe thank thee, O God, for a prophet To guide us in these latter days\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 196), for we have living prophets; we don\u2019t have to depend on the dead prophets alone. We have the living prophets to guide and direct us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p20\" class=\"\">Jesus was quite definite in his statements too.

He didn\u2019t say that, just because they were blind, they would arrive at their destination. And so we have to be sure and prepare ourselves and know that we have found that one and only true church that Paul spoke about. In order to do that, we have to turn to the words of the holy prophets.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p25\" class=\"\">Jesus said: \u201cSearch the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28837\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28837)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28837)\">John 5:39<\/a><\/span>.) And this is by studying the scriptures.

I had a call last week from a minister who lives in Los Angeles, who served, as he told me, for 20 years as a Baptist minister. Then he met the Mormon elders and they taught him the gospel as it has been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and he gave up his ministry and became a member of the Church. He is now working in the temple there, and he called me to thank me for writing the missionary book that helped him to understand what the Lord has done in restoring his truth to the earth in this dispensation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p28\" class=\"\">Just a few years ago, we converted a minister from up in the Northwest.

Now,\u201d he said, \u201cthey won\u2019t listen to me; I am an apostate from their church.\u201d But he gave up his ministry and ran the elevator here in our capitol building so that he could support himself and join the Church. He sat in my office and said: \u201cI can\u2019t wait until I can go into that temple with my wife,\u201d and I have since met him in the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p29\" class=\"\">He also said: \u201cWhen I joined the Church, I didn\u2019t feel that I could say that I <span class=\"emphasis\">knew<\/span> that Joseph Smith was a prophet, but I <span class=\"emphasis\">believed<\/span> that he was a prophet.\u201d Then he added: \u201cBut when Brother Burrows [and I know Brother Burrows] laid his hands on my head, and ordained me to the priesthood, something went through my being such as I had never felt before in all my life, and I knew that no man could do that for me. It had to come from the Lord.\u201d That is what we find when people are open-minded enough to be willing to listen and understand what the Lord has really done in restoring his truth to the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p30\" class=\"\">I would like to read a little statement here that I published in the book I wrote. It is taken from a pamphlet entitled <span class=\"emphasis\">The Strength of the \u2018Mormon\u2019 Position<\/span> (Orson F. Whitney, Independence, Mo.: Zion\u2019s Printing and Publishing Co., 1917). The late Elder Orson F. Whitney of the Council of the Twelve Apostles related the following incident under the heading, \u201cA Catholic Utterance\u201d:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cMany years ago a learned man, a member of the Roman Catholic Church, came to Utah and spoke from the stand of the Salt Lake Tabernacle. I became well acquainted with him, and we conversed freely and frankly. A great scholar, with perhaps a dozen languages at his tongue\u2019s end, he seemed to know all about theology, law, literature, science and philosophy. One day he said to me: \u2018You Mormons are all ignoramuses. You don\u2019t even know the strength of your own position. It is so strong that there is only one other tenable in the whole Christian world, and that is the position of the Catholic Church. The issue is between Catholicism and Mormonism. If we are right, you are wrong; if you are right, we are wrong; and that\u2019s all there is to it. The Protestants haven\u2019t a leg to stand on. For if we are wrong, they are wrong with us, since they were a part of us and went out from us; while if we are right, they are apostates whom we cut off long ago. If we have the apostolic succession from St. Peter, as we claim, there is no need of Joseph Smith and Mormonism; but if we have not that succession, then such a man as Joseph Smith was necessary, and Mormonism\u2019s attitude is the only consistent one. It is either the perpetuation of the gospel from ancient times, or the restoration of the gospel in latter days.\u2019\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,<\/span> LeGrand Richards, Deseret Book Co., 1958, pp. 3\u20134.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p32\" class=\"\">Now if the members of these 697 different churches could realize the consistency of that statement, they would want to know by what authority their ministers are performing the ordinances in their churches, because if the statement of this prelate is true, they either must be Catholics or Mormons. Then I always add that the Catholics and the Bible can\u2019t both be right because the Bible definitely proclaims an apostasy from the original church and a restoration in the latter days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/one-lord-one-faith-one-baptism.p33\" class=\"\">You remember when John was banished upon the Isle of Patmos, the angel of the Lord said: \u201cCome up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125036\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125036)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125036)\">Rev. 4:1<\/a><\/span>.) This was 30 years after the death of the Savior. The angel showed John the power that would be given to Satan \u201cto make war with the saints [and the saints were the followers of Jesus] and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42484\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42484)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42484)\">Rev. 13:7<\/a><\/span>.) That doesn\u2019t leave anybody out.
