This early warning system applies to children of all ages and contains three basic components: (1) reading and talking about the Book of Mormon with your children, (2) bearing testimony of gospel truths spontaneously with your children, and (3) inviting children as gospel learners to act and not merely be acted upon. Parents who do these things faithfully will be blessed to recognize early signals of spiritual growth in or challenges with their children and be better prepared to receive inspiration to strengthen and help those children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Component Number One: Reading and Talking about the Book of Mormon<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/watching-with-all-perseverance.p14\" class=\"\">The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the Savior\u2019s gospel and is the only book the Lord Himself has testified to be true (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120467\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120467)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120467)\">D&amp;C 17:6<\/a><\/span>; see also Russell\u00a0M.

The root word <span class=\"emphasis\">plain<\/span> in this verse does not refer to things that are ordinary or simple; rather, it denotes instruction that is clear and easily understood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/watching-with-all-perseverance.p16\" class=\"\">The Book of Mormon is the most correct of any book on earth because it centers upon the Truth (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120260\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120260)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120260)\">John 14:6<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120322\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120322)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120322)\">1\u00a0Nephi 13:40<\/a><\/span>), even Jesus Christ, and restores the plain and precious things that have been taken away from the true gospel (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120321\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120321)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120321)\">1\u00a0Nephi 13:26, 28\u201329, 32, 34\u201335, 40<\/a><\/span>). The unique combination of these two factors\u2014a focus on the Savior and the plainness of the teachings\u2014powerfully invites the confirming witness of the third member of the Godhead, even the Holy Ghost. Consequently, the Book of Mormon speaks to the spirit and to the heart of the reader like no other volume of scripture.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/watching-with-all-perseverance.p17\" class=\"\">The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that abiding by the precepts found in the Book of Mormon would help us \u201cget nearer to God\u201d than any other book (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith<\/span> [2007], 64). Regular reading of and talking about the Book of Mormon invite the power to resist temptation and to produce feelings of love within our families.

And the questions a child asks, the observations a child shares, and the discussions that occur provide crucial spiritual early warning signals.

And a testimony need not always begin with the phrase \u201cI bear you my testimony.\u201d Our witness can be declared as simply as \u201cI know I was blessed with inspiration at work today\u201d or \u201cThe truth in this scripture always has been a powerful source of direction for me.\u201d Similar opportunities to bear testimony also can arise while traveling together in a car or bus or in a multitude of other settings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/watching-with-all-perseverance.p24\" class=\"\">The reactions of children to such impromptu testimony bearing and their eagerness or reluctance to participate are potent sources of spiritual early warning signals. A child\u2019s expression about a lesson learned in family scripture study or a candid statement of concern about a gospel principle or practice can be most illuminating and help parents better understand a child\u2019s specific question or needs. Such discussions\u2014especially when parents are as eager to listen intently as they are to talk\u2014can foster a supportive and secure environment in the home and encourage ongoing communication about difficult topics.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Component Number Three: Inviting Children to Act<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/watching-with-all-perseverance.p26\" class=\"\">In the grand division of all of God\u2019s creations, there are \u201cthings to act and things to be acted upon\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120333\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120333)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120333)\">2\u00a0Nephi 2:14<\/a><\/span>).

And imagine further that the children ask questions the parents are not prepared adequately to answer. Some parents might be apprehensive about such an unstructured approach to home evening. But the best family home evenings are not necessarily the product of preprepared, purchased, or downloaded packets of outlines and visual aids. What a glorious opportunity for family members to search the scriptures together and to be tutored by the Holy Ghost. \u201cFor the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; \u2026 and they did all labor, every man according to his strength\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120370\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120370)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120370)\">Alma 1:26<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/watching-with-all-perseverance.p30\" class=\"\">Are you and I helping our children become agents who act and seek learning by study and by faith, or have we trained our children to wait to be taught and acted upon?
