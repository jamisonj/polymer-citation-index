It is not national; it does not refer to Abraham, Israel or the\n  Gentiles, in a national capacity, as some suppose. To ascertain its meaning, we must dig up the root\n  and ascertain what it was that drew the saying out of Jesus.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">While Jesus was teaching the people, all the publicans and sinners drew near to hear Him; &ldquo;and\n  the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying: This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">1<\/span>\n  This is the keyword which unlocks the parable of the prodigal son. It was given to answer the\n  murmurings and questions of the Sadducees and Pharisees, who were querying, finding fault,<span class=\"footRef\">2<\/span> and\n  saying, &ldquo;How is it that this man as great as He pretends to be, eats with publicans and sinners?&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">3<\/span>\n  Jesus was not put to it so, but He could have found something to illustrate His subject, if He had\n  designed it for nation or nations; but He did not. It was for men in an individual capacity; and all\n  straining on this point is a bubble. &ldquo;This man receiveth sinners and eateth with them.&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">4<\/span><\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">And he spake this parable unto them&mdash;&ldquo;What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose\n  one of them doth not leave the ninety-and-nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until\n  he find it? And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he cometh\n  home, he calleth together his friends and neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have\n  found my sheep which was lost. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner\n  that repenteth, more than over ninety-and-nine just persons which need no repentance.&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span> The\n  hundred sheep represent one hundred Sadducees and Pharisees, as though Jesus had said, &ldquo;If you\n  Sadducees and Pharisees are in the sheepfold, I have no mission for you; I am sent to look up sheep\n  that are lost; and when I have found them, I will back them up and make joy in heaven.&rdquo;  This\n  represents hunting after a few individuals,<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> or one poor publican, which the Pharisees and Sadducees\n  despised.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">He also gave them the parable of the woman and her ten pieces of silver, and how she lost one,\n  and searching diligently, found it again, which gave more joy among the friends and neighbors than\n  the nine which were not lost; like I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God\n  over one sinner that repenteth,<span class=\"footRef\">7<\/span> more than over ninety-and-nine just<\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108532\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108532)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108532)\">Luke 15:1-2<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108335\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108335)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108335)\">Mark 7:2<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107914\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107914)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107914)\">Matt. 9:11<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108312\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108312)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108312)\">Mark 2:16<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108459\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108459)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108459)\">Luke 5:30<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">4. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108533\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108533)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108533)\">Luke 15:2<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">5. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108534\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108534)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108534)\">Luke 15:3-7<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">6. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107350\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107350)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107350)\">Jer. 16:16<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">7. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108537\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108537)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108537)\">Luke 15:8-10<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
