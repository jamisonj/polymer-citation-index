Theodore Tuttle, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1964, pp. 30-32<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brothers and sisters, the beautiful singing of this lovely chorus both this morning and\nthis afternoon has called to mind a statement about music which the Lord made in section 25\nof the Doctrine and Covenants. He said: \"For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea,\nthe song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon\ntheir heads\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14381\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14381)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14381)\">D&amp;C 25:12<\/a><\/span>).\nI pray that we all might be the \"righteous\" and receive the\npromised blessing of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nFor the past three years the fabric of our lives has been interwoven with the life and culture\nof the peoples of South America. These are great countries with tremendous potential for\nbringing the abundant life to their people. The people are indeed a people of promise and\ndestiny, and \"their day\" is near at hand.\n<\/p><p>\nWe return at this conference time with a firmer conviction that God lives and rules in the\naffairs of men and nations and that he has not forsaken the promise he has made concerning\nZion and its people and its protection.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Changes in South American Peoples<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nDuring our sojourn in South America we have witnessed some significant changes among\nboth men and nations. But of all of the changes that occur in the lives of the people whom\nthe gospel touches, perhaps the greatest change occurs in the life and experience of the\nfamily&mdash;the basic unit in the Church and society.\n<\/p><p>\nA recent convert expressed it this way: \"Prior to the visit of the missionaries to my home, I\nlived what I considered to be the normal role of a husband. I held a job and provided for my\nwife and children. When I came home from work, I considered myself free from further\nresponsibility to them. If I wanted to stay home, I did. If I did not want to stay home, I did\nnot. Usually it was the latter. Much of my time was spent outside of the home. I considered it\nmy wife's responsibility to rear the children. She was to see to it that they were fed and\nclothed and cared for. Occasionally she would take them to her church, but I felt that they\nshould be completely free to make up their own minds about religion, as I had been. While I\ndid not openly oppose their religious activity, I gave them no encouragement whatsoever.\n<\/p><p>\n\"My wife and I must have loved each other, but I confess, I gave little evidence of it. I really\nconsidered that ours were two separate worlds; I had mine and she and the children had theirs.\nI thought that when the boys were older, they could join me in my activities. But until then\nthey belonged in their mother's world. It was her duty to administer what discipline was\nnecessary. I did not meddle in her affairs, except occasionally when the situation needed my\nhusbandly authority, and it usually did not take me very long to settle that. Well,\" he\nconcluded, \"that was what I called my 'family life.' As I look back on it now, it seems as\nthough I were almost a stranger in my own house and a part-time husband to my wife.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAfter such an admission, I pressed him for a description of the changes that had lately\noccurred in his life. He gladly explained it this way: \"While I was being taught the restored\ngospel, I did not think that I could or would or even wanted to change my way of life. Only\nafter I began to study and pray did I realize that a change would shortly be inevitable.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Turning Point&mdash;My Testimony<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"At length I received a testimony that the gospel of Jesus Christ had indeed been restored and\nthat there is a living prophet on the earth today. This was the turning point. It was after my\nbaptism that the changes really began to occur in my, or more properly said, in our lives. For\nsomehow, now, the oneness that we were supposed to have in our life and marriage actually\nbecame a reality. I think the reason was that I began to understand the sacredness of marriage\nand the need of honoring my marriage vows. In church I was taught the importance and joy\nof being faithful to my wife and honorable and worthy before my children.\nYou know,\" he said, \"no one ever told me before that I would find joy in everyday living\nmerely by keeping the commandments of the Lord. I had been taught that our lot in this life\nwas sorrow and pain and poverty, that only in the next life would we find the joy we longed\nfor here.\n<\/p><p>\n\"As we continued to attend the meetings of the Church, we learned the practical application of\nactive church membership and how the principles of theology actually find their expression in\neveryday life. And now,\" he added, \"we have plenty of opportunity to practice all of the\nvirtues we were being taught by accepting calls of service in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>I Taught My Sons<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"For the first time,\" he continued, \"I realized what my sons could become. I realized that they\ncould be reared in the kind of atmosphere that produced the missionaries who brought the\ngospel to my home. So I set about to teach my sons moral principles. I taught them that it\nwas wrong to lie, to swear, to steal, to break any of the Ten Commandments. I taught them\nlove of neighbor, because now I understood its application. I taught them reverence for sacred\nplaces and things. I now encouraged them in their church activity. I taught them that religion\nwas not just for women, that character and faith in God were the hallmarks of a real man. We\nbegan to have fun together. I became a part of their world. I'm even beginning to speak and\nunderstand their language.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"I Know the Way to Eternal Life\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"I cannot begin to tell you,\" he said, \"all of the new things I have learned about life since\nbecoming a member of this Church. I now know the purpose of life. I know the way to\neternal life&mdash;the teachings of the Church, even in a short time, have taught me that.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But it has been in our home that the major changes occurred. I go to work, as usual, but now\nI always come home. I am not only an active participant in our family life, but I also preside\nby right of holding the priesthood. And I think I am learning something about exercising\nauthority in love and patience and understanding.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And you won't believe this,\" he continued, \"but even though I am busier than I ever was (I\nam presently a counselor in the branch presidency), I seem to have more time than ever\nbefore. Why, I even find myself occasionally helping my wife in the kitchen, and that's\nsomething I thought I'd never do. Knowing that the family unit is to be eternal has given me\na completely new view of the importance and purpose of family life.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well,\" he concluded, and his eyes were moist with tears of gratitude, \"perhaps you can\nunderstand now why I am willing to serve the Lord, work in the Church, help my fellow\nman, and share the message that has brought such happiness to my life.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>One of the Miracles of Mormonism<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe have seen this change occur not in just this one family but in literally hundreds of\nfamilies. In fact, the missionaries have told me that it is a common experience for them to\nnotice that the homes of the people they visit get cleaner each time they call to teach them\nmore about the gospel, and yet, they have said nothing about cleaning the house. This is one\nof the miracles of Mormonism. This and similar manifestations occur continually.\n<\/p><p>\nIn Job we read: \". . . there is a spirit in man; and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them\nunderstanding\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26712\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26712)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26712)\">Job 32:8<\/a><\/span>).\nWhat the light of the sun is to the flower, causing it to unfold\nfrom within and turn to the source of light, so the gospel light is to the soul of man. It\ntouches the inner life of man and without compulsion turns him to the source of light and\ntruth.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd yet, one cannot find the cause for this by looking at the unfolding of the flower; rather\none must look to the source of light which works the miracle of growth and change. Indeed, it\nis the refulgence of the First Vision, the belief and acceptance of which touches the spirit of\nman, and he responds to the inspiration of the Almighty.\n<\/p><p>\nFamily life changes, not because of any outward conditions, but because of inner convictions.\nAnd those who look for the reason for this change in outward evidences look\nin vain. It is not to be found there. It lies not in the new buildings being erected. It is not in\nthe schools we have built throughout the world. It is not found in the church organization,\nperfect as it is. It is not in the youth program, the Primary, or Relief Society where social and\ncultural programs without peer are carried on. Nor does it lie in the fraternity of the\npriesthood quorums. Whoever looks for the key to change in the exterior manifestations looks\nin vain, as did Elijah. He heard the voice of the Lord not in the wind, nor in the earthquake,\nnor in the fire, but in the still, small voice (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1228\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1228)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1228)\">1 Kgs. 19:11-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe power that changes a man's heart is inherent in the testimony that distills upon the souls\nof men, witnessing to them that the First Vision of the boy Prophet Joseph Smith was indeed\na divine reality. I quote a part of the Prophet's marvelous vision. He said:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which\ndescended gradually until it fell upon me.\n<\/p><p>\n\"It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound.\nWhen the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all\ndescription, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name\nand said, pointing to the other&mdash;<i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!<\/i>\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30454\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30454)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30454)\">JS&mdash;H 1:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Key to Improvement of Family<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHerein lies the key to improvement of the family. Herein lies the reason for expectation of\nsuccess. Herein lies the contribution of this Church to the world&mdash;the ideal family.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear humble witness that God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ actually appeared to\nJoseph Smith the Prophet. I bear testimony that they live, that Jesus Christ is the actual Son\nof God, that he is the head of this Church, that he directs it through his chosen prophet and\nmouthpiece, President David O. McKay. I bear this witness humbly in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
