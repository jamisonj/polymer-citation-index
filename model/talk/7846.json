Invisible to my untrained eyes but easily detected by lifeguards on a nearby watchtower, the powerful current posed a danger to all who left the safety of the shore and entered the water. I remember rationalizing, \u201cI\u2019m a strong swimmer. Swimming will be great exercise. I\u2019ll be safe in the shallow water.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/choose-eternal-life.p6\" class=\"\">Ignoring the warnings and feeling confident in my own judgment, I entered the water to enjoy a \u201crefreshing\u201d swim. After a few minutes I looked up to locate my family on the nearby beach, but the beach was no longer nearby! The deceptive current I had been warned of had captured me and was quickly pulling me away from my family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/choose-eternal-life.p7\" class=\"\">Confidently at first and then desperately, I tried to swim toward shore, but the unforgiving current dragged me farther and farther into deeper, rougher water. I became exhausted and began choking on inhaled water. Drowning became a real possibility. My energy gone, I frantically and finally called out for help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/choose-eternal-life.p8\" class=\"\">Miraculously, it seemed, a lifeguard was immediately at my side. I wasn\u2019t aware that he had watched me go into the water. He knew the current would capture me, and he knew where it would take me. Avoiding the current, he swam around and just beyond where I was struggling; then he patiently waited for me to call for help. Too weak to swim to shore alone, I was and still am grateful for his rescue. Without his help I never could have made it back to my family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/choose-eternal-life.p9\" class=\"\">That day I made a poor choice that produced potentially serious consequences for me and for my family.

If you choose not to eat dinner, you are choosing to go to bed now, without ice cream.\u201d Our granddaughter considered her two choices and then stated emphatically, \u201cI want <span class=\"emphasis\">this<\/span> choice\u2014to play <span class=\"emphasis\">and<\/span> eat only ice cream <span class=\"emphasis\">and<\/span> not go to bed.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/choose-eternal-life.p15\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, do we wish we could play, eat only ice cream, never go to bed, and somehow avoid consequences like malnutrition and exhaustion?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/choose-eternal-life.p16\" class=\"\">In reality we have only two eternal choices, each with eternal consequences: choose to follow the Savior of the world and thus choose eternal life with our Heavenly Father or choose to follow the world and thus choose to separate ourselves from Heavenly Father eternally.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/choose-eternal-life.p17\" class=\"\">We cannot successfully choose both the safety of righteousness and the dangers of worldliness.

They know that there is safety and ultimately joy only in and through our Savior, Jesus Christ, and living His gospel. As Elder Dallin\u00a0H.
