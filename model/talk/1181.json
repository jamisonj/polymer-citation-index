Dyer, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1962, pp. 9-13<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brothers and sisters, it has been our great privilege this morning to hear the opening\nmessage of our beloved President. I feel grateful for his words of counsel and enlightenment,\nwhich have already, through his remarks today and in meetings previous to the conference, set\nthe spirit of the conference.\n<\/p><p>\nI feel that I should be ungrateful this morning if I did not testify to you, my brethren and\nsisters, and to my fellow associates, as one with you who has come to know that President\nMcKay is truly a prophet of God, and who in the inspiration and revelation of his calling is\neffectively leading the Church in its present great period of expansion. I have witnessed his\nprophecies come true and have participated in the unerring wisdom of his counsel. Truly he is\na great missionary Apostle and President His travels throughout the world in behalf of God's\nwork have exceeded even the travels of the early-day apostles.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay is loved by each of the General Authorities who stand unitedly by his side\nand who are willing to give their all in following his inspired leadership. His guileless love\nfor the Saints finds a spring of affection in the hearts of us all. His vision is the inspiration, I\nam confident, behind the acceleration of our proselyting effort all over the world with which I\nhave been directly connected and to which I can testify. Not only this, but under his direction\nother facets of Church growth are going forward to match these increased conversions: the\nexpanded building program to provide the facilities of worship and cultural growth among the\nmembers; the increased activity in the priesthood, in the church education system whereby\nthrough universities, colleges, institutes, and in the auxiliaries, the youth of the Church, who,\nwhile safeguarding their lives, are being prepared for leadership in the Church&mdash;the integral\nexpansion of which is demanding that at least 15,000 new stake and ward leaders be called\neach year to match the growth of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThe erection of temples, particularly in foreign lands, has proved to be a great stimulus to the\nfaith of the members in these areas, and has caused thousands to remain in their native lands\nto help build the Church stronger, rather than to come to America and the West. The\neffectiveness of the Church welfare program continues. Many other phases of the Church\nprogram could be mentioned which are going forward under the inspired leadership of our\nbeloved President.\n<\/p><p>\nI am deeply grateful, my brethren and sisters, for the great honor and privilege that came to\nSister Dyer and me and our son for a part of his mission which he also spent in Europe; for\nthe privilege of serving in these ancient lands and of having the privilege of witnessing the\npower of God go forward in the expansion of his work. I have seen almost daily the witness\nof the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ in the lives of people and have seen many men and\nwomen in almost every land receive of the teachings of the gospel from the missionaries and\nthen have watched their lives change and have witnessed their preparation to become leaders\nin the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nI am most grateful this morning that here in the congregation are men who have been called\nto preside over stakes in Europe. I have been directly connected with these men. I know of\ntheir faith and their love of the gospel and of their desire to see the work of\nthe Lord go forward.\n<\/p><p>\nThe most frequent question that is asked of me since my return from Europe is this: \"What is\ncausing this tremendous growth in the Church? What is it that is causing people to accept the\ngospel more readily than ever before?\" In analyzing this, I have come to the conclusion that\nthere are three areas of activity which combine to produce the rise in converts in virtually all\nof the missions of the world. The fact that these very things are transpiring calls to mind the\nparable of the fig tree (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31571\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31571)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31571)\">Luke 21:29-33<\/a><\/span>)\nwith its symbolical indication which the Master gave as an evidence of\nthe approaches to the culmination of his work here upon the earth.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>The first reason<\/i>, I surmised, is simply that the harvest time is here. When the Prophet Joseph\nSmith was being instructed in the work which he had been called to do by holy messengers\nsent from the presence of God, it was made known to him by revelation, as our beloved\nprophet has mentioned this morning, that a great and marvelous work was about to come forth\namong the children of men, but the Lord also said that the field was white already to harvest\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14077\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14077)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14077)\">D&amp;C 4:1,4<\/a><\/span>).\nAs to the meaning of the field being white already to harvest, we are enlightened by the\nwords of the Apostle Paul, who by prophetic utterance told the Saints at Ephesus of that\nwhich would transpire in the very day in which we now live. This is his declaration: \n<\/p><p>\n\"That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in\nChrist, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be\nholy and without blame before him in love: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to\nthe good pleasure of his will\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21732\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21732)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21732)\">Eph. 1:10,4-5<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nThus, from the statement of the Lord given to Hyrum Smith\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14086\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14086)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14086)\">D&amp;C 11:1<\/a><\/span>), through the Prophet Joseph\nSmith, and from this statement of Paul, we conclude that many of the noble and valiant spirits\nof the pre-existence have been withheld as to birth into mortality until this particular time that\nthey may be here upon the earth, either born under the covenant or converted to the gospel of\nJesus Christ, that there will be strength within the Church to fulfil the divine commitments\nwhich the Lord has placed upon us as a people. These choice spirits so withheld, as could be\nexpected, respond more readily to the gospel message here in life when they hear it.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord speaks of this very thing, as referred to by the Apostle John, concerning the mission\nof the Holy Ghost whom the Master sent after his earth life departure, which was to bring\nremembrance to those who, by the spirit of conviction, would recognize the message of truth\nwhen they heard it. These are his words: \n<\/p><p>\n\"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he\nshall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said\nunto you\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28028\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28028)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28028)\">John 14:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFor the purpose of awakening interest in the hearts of people, we have learned that nearly all\nconverts to the Church today sense that the gospel message is true the first time they heard it\nproclaimed by the missionaries.\n<\/p><p>\nI recall a noted architect in Munich, mature in years, highly successful in his field of work, a\nrespected man in his city and church, who recognized, by the power of the Spirit, that Joseph\nSmith was a prophet of God the first time that the missionaries testified of it. He came to\nknow this and of the truth of the message of the restoration from this initial awakening of\ninterest, or the \"bringing of things to his remembrance\" and was led to baptism and is now\nwith his wife an active member of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nA noted attorney in Stuttgart sensed in his heart upon first contact by the missionaries that the\ngospel is true, though his baptism was delayed for several weeks while the missionaries taught\nhim the lessons, which he confessed to me later that he could not fully understand at the time.\nThis attorney knew that the elders were servants of God and that they had told him\nthe truth. He is now a member of a bishopric in the Stuttgart Stake.\n<\/p><p>\nA mature woman and her daughter, whose husband and father was dead, replied to a Danish\nmissionary, when asked if they had understood all of their teachings concerning the Godhead\nand the Holy Ghost, that they did not, but the woman said she knew they were true servants\nof God, and she accepted what they had told them to be true, and after repentance they were\nbaptized members of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>The second reason<\/i>, I believe, for the increased number of conversions is that the Church and\nits objectives stand today in a much better image before the world than ever before. There are\nmany reasons for this that have gone on through the years, and it would appear that the\nrelentless general good behavior and upstanding characteristics of the members of the Church\nis beginning to have its effect upon good men and women, civic and educational leaders, and\nother inspired men all over the world.\n<\/p><p>\nI think the relentless effectiveness of the Tabernacle Choir Broadcast, coupled with the\ngoodwill tours that have been made, has been a great contribution in breaking the crust of\nfalse concept and has established us in better image before the people of the world, along with\nthe many services which are rendered by the Church Information Service and the many\nbureaus of information at temples, historic sites, and mainly the Temple Square Bureau, where\npeople have come to know the truth about us.\n<\/p><p>\nThe outstanding representation we are now receiving from favorable newspaper and magazine\npublicity has helped. In some instances, through advertising agencies, but usually the efforts\nof mission presidents and missionaries, who in the course of their regular proselyting\nprocedures and as a part of their program, contact the various civic and educational leaders\nand keep in close touch with the newspapers, make it a definite point to get acquainted with\neditors and reporters. In Europe this has been especially effective, where more than 8,000\nnewspaper articles favorable to the Church have been obtained, many of which show pictures\nof the missionaries, most usually in the process of calling upon people, holding cottage\nmeetings, cycling on the cycle paths to and from their tracting districts and in pursuing other\ntypical missionary routines.\n<\/p><p>\nPress conferences have proved to be most helpful in getting our story before the public, and\nwe have witnessed a change come over the civic and educational leaders in Europe whereby\ntoday we have recognition, and we are finding that information about the Church is being\nsought for and not necessarily only as we offer it. It is not unusual for the mayor and the\nministers of education, presidents of universities, presidents of various states, and other\ninfluential people to be present with their wives at press receptions. We have been able to get\nmany of our generals and leaders of our Armed Forces in Europe to attend these press\nreceptions and into this atmosphere we have brought newspaper and magazine reporters and\neditors, and they have been amazed to see the influential people who have been in attendance.\n<\/p><p>\nVery often these reporters have been heard to say, \"What is the mayor doing here?\" Or, \"Why\nis the president of the university present?\" The answer is, of course, \"They are friends of the\nChurch,\" and invariably because of the high caliber and sincerity of these affairs, more\ncomprehensive articles about the Church have resulted.\n<\/p><p>\nOpportunities for free radio and television time, where the story of the Church can be told, is\nincreasing with each passing week. The correction of disparaging articles about the Church,\nand the replacement of erroneous sections in encyclopedias, in books of knowledge, is a\nconstant task, but many important steps are being taken in this regard to establish a better\nimage of the Church and our people through these sources of information in the various\ncountries of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have witnessed a vast improvement in the attitude of individuals. If time would permit, I\ncould tell of experiences with ministers of education, with editors of many of the large\nnewspapers in Europe, and with others who have actually defended the position of the Church\nand are publishing favorable articles about us, which assist the missionaries\nwith the golden question, when they ask, \"What do you know about the Mormon Church?\"\nInstead of there being a negative answer, there is a willingness to listen, and this is\ncontributing to the expansion of proselyting effectiveness in the world.\n<\/p><p>\nOf course we have a long way to go yet to gain the full effect before the world of the image\nof our people, but definite progress is being made.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>The third reason<\/i> is the concept of \"Every Member a Missionary,\" as inspired by our beloved\nPresident. This has led to more effective ways of getting the gospel message to people. If\nevery member of the Church will react to this inspiration, fulfilling the commitment that has\nbeen placed upon us as a people, there is every reason to believe that the convert expansion of\nthe Church will continue.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the preface of the Doctrine and Covenants there is recorded what the Lord made known to\nthe Prophet Joseph Smith that we are expected as a people to convey to the masses of the\nworld for the purpose \". . . that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even\nthe Savior of the world\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14066\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14066)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14066)\">D&amp;C 1:20<\/a><\/span>);\nand this means that a man who stands at the head of his household\nmay receive the priesthood through his faithfulness and then be able to speak in the name of\nthe Lord for and in behalf of his family and Church, and also \"That faith might increase in\nthe earth; \n<\/p><p>\n\"That mine everlasting covenant might be established; \n<\/p><p>\n\"That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends\nof the world, and before kings and rulers\" \n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14067\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14067)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14067)\">D&amp;C 1:20-23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe inspiration of our prophet in the projection of the idea that every member be a missionary\nforms a concept, which like a banner, must be kept high. There should be no apathy within\nthe ranks of the Church to this great challenge. The enthusiasm and spirit of missionary work\nmust be kept alive and active in the heart of every member, for this is the spirit of the\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I see it there are three kinds of missionaries in the Church. There is the full-time\nmissionary, who devotes his every waking hour in leading souls into the kingdom of our\nHeavenly Father through the waters of baptism, and then there is the part-time missionary,\nwho devotes all of his time except that which is needed to make a living and to care for his\nfamily. Then there is the member missionary who by example and his good life will provide\nan image of the Church for his neighbors and friends and relatives to observe. They will assist\nthe missionaries by opening their homes to investigators and to assist in other ways, in\nconveying the gospel message to those who do not understand the truth\n<\/p><p>\nI am most grateful, my brethren and sisters, that the message of the gospel is to the\nindividual, for each person can receive and evaluate the truth for himself. I thrilled recently as\nI attended a meeting behind the Iron Curtain in East Germany to hear one of the leaders stand\nand testify that no one could tell him how to worship God in his own heart. Jesus, in his\nparables, manifested his way of teaching which was always to the individual as evidenced by\nhis parables \"a certain nobleman,\" \"Behold the sower,\" \"The rich young ruler,\" \"The ninety\nand nine and the search for the one that is lost,\" \"The prodigal son,\" etc.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat is true of conversion is true of membership in the Church, for each of us must work out\nour own salvation, and as the Prophet Joseph Smith said, \"at times it may be with fear and\ntrembling\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41259\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41259)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41259)\">Philip. 2:12<\/a><\/span>)\nbut our obligation is to convey the message of the gospel unto the people of the\nworld. This means our neighbor, as well as those who are afar off.\n<\/p><p>\nIn conclusion may I read two statements from the revelations of the Lord concerning our\nobligation to teach the gospel. The Prophet Joseph Smith said that we are not to be ashamed\nto stand up boldly for the cause of Christ, for said he: \". . . It should be the duty of the Elder\nto stand up boldly for the cause of Christ and warn that people with one accord to repent and\nbe baptized for the remission of sins, and for the Holy Ghost, always commanding them in\nthe name of the Lord, in the spirit of meekness\" (<i>DHC<\/i>, Vol. 2, p. 263).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the other revelation the Lord directs all of the members of the Church to\nproclaim the gospel: \". . . I give unto you a commandment, that every man, both elder, priest,\nteacher, <i>and also member<\/i>, go to with his might, with the labor of his hands, to prepare and\naccomplish the things which I have commanded.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And let your preaching be the warning voice, every man to his neighbor\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14111\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14111)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14111)\">D&amp;C 38:40-41<\/a><\/span>, italics added).\n<\/p><p>\nI testify to you, my brethren and sisters, in the name of Jesus Christ, that this is the Lord's\nwork, and I pray that we may go forth in it and fulfil the commitment of extending the gospel\nin a continuing manner unto the children of the world, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
