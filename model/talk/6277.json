President Tagg suggested as part of the mission tour we include a preparation day and take a bus trip to see the beautiful Milford Sound. Part of the trip involved stopping at several beautiful scenic sites along the way. At one of those stops, as we walked back to the bus, I became curious about a group of passengers standing in a circle on the road taking photographs. As I peered over the people, I saw in the circle a frightened little baby lamb on wobbly legs. It appeared to be no more than a few hours old. I have seen a lot of sheep in my life since my father-in-law was in the sheep business. Consequently, I had no interest in taking a photograph of a solitary lamb, so I boarded the bus and waited.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p5\" class=\"\">After all the passengers finally boarded the bus, the driver picked up the frightened little lamb in his arms, held it tenderly against his chest, and brought it on the bus. He sat down, closed the door, picked up his microphone, and said to us: \u201cUndoubtedly a band of sheep has gone through here this morning, and this little lamb has strayed. Perhaps if we take it with us, we might find the band of sheep farther up the road and return this baby lamb to its mother.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p6\" class=\"\">We drove through several kilometers of beautiful forests and finally came to a beautiful meadow of tall, flowing grass. Sure enough, there in the meadow was a band of sheep feeding. The bus driver stopped the bus and excused himself. We all thought he would put the lamb down on the side of the road and come back, but he didn\u2019t. With the lamb in his arms, he carefully and quietly walked out through the grass toward the band of sheep. When he got as close as he could without disturbing them, he gently put the lamb down and then remained in the field to make sure the baby lamb returned to the fold.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p7\" class=\"\">As he returned to the bus, he once again picked up his microphone and said, \u201cOh, can\u2019t you hear that mother sheep saying, \u2018Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you for bringing my lost lamb back home to me!\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p8\" class=\"\">As I think of this wonderful teaching moment provided by the bus driver, my thoughts turn to the parable the Lord gave us of the lost sheep:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cThen drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he spake this parable unto them, saying,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cWhat man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cI say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32664\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32664)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32664)\">Luke 15:1\u20137<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p16\" class=\"\">Our prophet today, President Gordon B.

There are widows who long for friendly voices and that spirit of anxious concern which speaks of love. There are those who were once warm in the faith, but whose faith has grown cold. Many of them wish to come back but do not know quite how to do it. They need friendly hands reaching out to them. With a little effort, many of them can be brought back to feast again at the table of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cMy brethren and sisters, I would hope, I would pray, that each of us \u2026 would resolve to seek those who need help, who are in desperate and difficult circumstances, and lift them in the spirit of love into the embrace of the Church, where strong hands and loving hearts will warm them, comfort them, sustain them, and put them on the way of happy and productive lives\u201d (\u201cReach with a Rescuing Hand,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1996, 86).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p19\" class=\"\">In light of our prophet\u2019s concern, might we ask ourselves, \u201cWhy is it that some who were once warm in the faith have grown cold in the faith?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p20\" class=\"\">If we are to succeed in the prophetic mandate to perfect the Saints, we must also succeed in our efforts to strengthen those who have grown cold in their faith.
