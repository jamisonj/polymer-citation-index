A humble couple from Idaho met fear with faith when the Lord called them to Russia. They wrote the following acceptance letter: \u201cNo one would have imagined we would be called to this assignment. We have no idea how we will learn the language or manage to be of service, and although we accept with much trepidation, going completely on faith, we know that the Lord and His prophet know more than we do where we should serve.\u201d Ten months later the Stockholm Sweden Temple welcomed 30 Saints from a small branch in Russia led by this couple from Idaho who had barely begun to learn the Russian language. The scriptures tell us, \u201cGod has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-25905_000_017\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44220\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44220)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44220)\">Mosiah 8:18<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Thus, God\u2019s work is carried out by His children: \u201cThat faith also might increase in the earth. \u2026 That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-25905_000_017\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44221\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44221)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44221)\">D&amp;C 1:21, 23<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/couple-missionaries-blessings-from-sacrifice-and-service.p8\" class=\"\">Another couple faced family concerns with faith. A faithful sister wrote: \u201cThe decision to serve a mission was not hard. But my 90-year-old mother was extremely apprehensive about our leaving. She took great comfort when she heard that our families would be blessed as we serve.\u201d A faithful brother expressed similar concerns about leaving his elderly parents, to which his father responded: \u201cDon\u2019t use your mother and me as an excuse not to go on a mission with your wife. You pray about it and follow the guidance of the Spirit.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/couple-missionaries-blessings-from-sacrifice-and-service.p9\" class=\"\">To an earlier generation of missionaries called to leave their families, the Lord offered this reassurance: \u201cAnd if they will do this in all lowliness of heart, \u2026 I, the Lord, give unto them a promise that I will provide for their families.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-25905_000_017\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44222\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44222)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44222)\">D&amp;C 118:3<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/couple-missionaries-blessings-from-sacrifice-and-service.p10\" class=\"\">Certainly family concerns are real and should not be considered lightly. But we cannot meet our family challenges without the blessings of the Lord; and when we sacrifice to serve as full-time missionary couples, those blessings will flow. For example, one couple worried about leaving their youngest daughter who was no longer active in the Church. Her faithful father wrote: \u201cWe prayed for her continually and fasted regularly. Then, during general conference, the Spirit whispered to me, \u2018If you will serve, you will not have to worry about your daughter anymore.\u2019 So we met with our bishop. The week after we received our call, she and her boyfriend announced they were engaged. Before we left for Africa, we had a wedding in our home. [Then we gathered our family together and] held a family council. \u2026 I bore testimony of the Lord and Joseph Smith \u2026 and told them I would like to give each of them a father\u2019s blessing. I started with the oldest son and then his wife and proceeded to the youngest \u2026 [including our new son-in-law].\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/couple-missionaries-blessings-from-sacrifice-and-service.p11\" class=\"\">As we consider couple missionary service, it is appropriate to involve our families in the same way. In family council meetings, we can give our children the opportunity to express their support, offer special assistance we may need, and receive priesthood blessings to sustain them in our absence. Where appropriate, we may be able to receive priesthood blessings from them as well. As the faithful father in this story blessed his family members, his son-in-law felt the influence of the Holy Ghost. The father wrote: \u201cBy the end of our first year [the] heart [of our son-in-law] began to soften toward the Church. Just before we returned home from our mission, he and our daughter came to visit us. In his suitcase was the first set of Sunday clothes he had ever owned. They came to Church with us, and after we returned home he was baptized.

Perhaps over the years you have been burdened by feelings of regret or felt less than adequate because you did not have a missionary opportunity to serve and grow when you were younger. My advice to you: look forward, not back. Begin preparing for your mission as a senior missionary couple today! Save a little money each month. Study the scriptures. Accept Church callings. Pray to feel the Lord\u2019s love for others and receive His love and confidence in you.

After 51 years of marriage, I was asked, \u201cWhat part of life would you want to live over again?\u201d I did not hesitate to reply, \u201cWhen my wife and I served together in the great missionary work of the Lord.\u201d The sentiments of another missionary couple echo those of my wife and myself: \u201cOur decision to go on a mission brought new vigor, new emotions, new friends, new places, new challenges. It brought us closer together as husband and wife; we had a common goal and a real partnership. And best of all, it brought new spiritual growth, instead of spiritual retirement.\u201d Brothers and sisters, let us not go into spiritual retirement.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/couple-missionaries-blessings-from-sacrifice-and-service.p17\" class=\"\">Now, may I extend a challenge to bishops and branch presidents throughout the world? Over the next six months, would it be possible for each of you to consider recommending one or more missionary couples beyond those presently planning to serve? Your greatest resource in meeting this challenge will be those senior members of your ward who have already served missions. In my own ward, an inspired bishop called a special meeting of prospective and returned missionary couples. As we bore our testimonies of sacrifice and service, the Spirit witnessed to us all that a call to serve is indeed a call to \u201cknow the richness of [the Lord\u2019s] blessing[s].\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote13-25905_000_017\">13<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cCalled to Serve,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 249.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/couple-missionaries-blessings-from-sacrifice-and-service.p18\" class=\"\">I\u2019ve heard of a stake president who has arranged a senior missionary class to inspire prospective missionary couples and help them prepare to serve.
