Who can gauge the value of that special chat between daughter and Dad as they weed or water the garden? How do we evaluate the good that comes from the obvious lessons of planting, cultivating, and the eternal law of the harvest? And how do we measure the family togetherness and cooperating that must accompany successful canning? Yes, we are laying up resources in store, but perhaps the greater good is contained in the lessons of life we learn as we <span class=\"emphasis\">live providently<\/span> and extend to our children their pioneer heritage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/welfare-services-the-gospel-in-action.p54\" class=\"\">Think of the learning that accompanies a family council on the family budget.
