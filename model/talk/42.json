Young, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1942, pp. 50-51<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nIt was a hundred years ago that Stephen A. Douglas came to Nauvoo to visit the Prophet\nJoseph. He had previously been employed as counsel in some litigation in which the Prophet\nwas involved, and was a very warm friend of his. As he surveyed that lovely city, Nauvoo (in\n1843 it was the largest city in Illinois, with a population upwards of twenty thousand people)\nhe saw the orderliness, the magnetic power that the Prophet seemed to have with his people,\nand he is said to have remarked that if he could command the leadership that the Prophet\nJoseph had, he would lead a group of people to the Northwest and give up his political career.\nHe was then in the House of Representatives in Washington.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is one thing, however, that Douglas seems to have overlooked. We sang today \"A Poor\nWayfaring Man of Grief.\" The Prophet Joseph was in prison. Everything that he possessed,\napparently, was in the hands of his enemies, but there was something that was still within his\nown soul&mdash;there was something that he still possessed that Stephen A. Douglas had not\nrecognized. He could, in the face of his enemy, in the face of persecution conscious of\nmartyrdom&mdash;he could still sing with Brother Taylor, at least in his heart, that lovely hymn, a\nhymn of charity, a hymn of kindness, a hymn of forgiveness, even of his enemy. That was\nsomething that Stephen A. Douglas didn't detect. Stephen A. Douglas didn't detect, either,\nthat same attitude of spirit that the Prophet Joseph had, when in Liberty Jail there came to\nhim through the revelation of Almighty God that marvelous prayer in which he instructed the\nPriesthood, an injunction that stands for you and me today:\n<\/p><p>\nNo power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by\npersuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;\n<\/p><p>\nBy kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and\nwithout guile&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nReproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing\nforth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee\nto be his enemy;\n<\/p><p>\nThat he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11819\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11819)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11819)\">D&amp;C 121:41-44<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen in instruction to his people&mdash;and mind you he was in prison, in a dingy, dirty, prison,\nrestrained as far as the physical part of him was concerned; everything taken away from him,\nin the bigness of his soul he said:\n<\/p><p>\nLet thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let\nvirtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence\nof God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of\nrighteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without\ncompulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11821\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11821)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11821)\">D&amp;C 121:45-46<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt was this, my brethren, it was this attribute that was manifest in Carthage Jail that Stephen\nA. Douglas never felt. He saw only, but he did not feel. That is one reason why today it is\nrecognized by people around us that there is a bigness in the coming together, as we do here\non these occasions of the general conference, but those who do not know as we know do not\nsense the bigness of this thing. They do not know what it is that impels men to come\nhundreds of miles in answer to a call such as this. They do not know what it is that impels\nmen in our outlying stakes to give their all, almost, for the benefit of their brethren, to help\nbuild up their social life, their physical life, and, above all, their spiritual life. These are the\nthings that men do not realize when they come in our midst. These are the things that men\ndid not realize when they came to Nauvoo, in the days of the Prophet Joseph. They saw\nmerely the external, not the internal; but there is a power here that you and I feel, and we are\ngrateful to God tonight for it, for the testimony that God has given us of the divinity of this\nwork, and I rejoice with you in it with all my heart, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
