It was a beautiful sight on that hazy winter day. Senses were stirred as one drove with anticipation along that friendly, colorful street. Around each bend in the road rose the yellow balloons, waving upward to the top of the hill where they warmly proclaimed: \u201cWELCOME HOME, BRIGHAM!\u201d I had heard of Brigham Fordham only a few months ago when I was told of this young eighteen-year-old\u2019s tragic accident that left him paralyzed. I only now discovered that this was his home and his homecoming from the hospital.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p4\" class=\"\">I noticed the ramp that had been built to the front of the house and thought of other changes that would have been made in his home to accommodate the changes in his life. There will be changes in Brigham\u2019s family, too, I thought. Life will be different for all the Fordhams\u2014and difficult.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p5\" class=\"\">But, as the yellow balloons brightly signaled to Brigham and to all who had the opportunity to travel this street, his was a caring home where family love and strength would be found.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p6\" class=\"\">Our Heavenly Father has organized us into families for the purpose of helping us successfully meet the trials and challenges of life. The home also exists to bless us with the joys and privileges of family associations. Our family is our safety place, our support network, our sanctuary, and our salvation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p7\" class=\"\">Our homes should be \u201cthe strong place to which children can come for the anchor they need in this day of trouble and turmoil,\u201d said President Harold B.

There is no happiness without service, and there is no greater service than that which converts the home into a divine institution, and which promotes and preserves family life.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Doctrine,<\/span> 5th ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1939, p. 300.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p13\" class=\"\">On the night of September 21, 1989, Hurricane Hugo passed with all its fury over the beautiful city of Charleston, South Carolina. My good friend Alvie Evans lived in a low-lying area near the water, where the maximum strength of the storm was headed. He gathered his family together and moved to higher ground, to the home of his mother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p14\" class=\"\">Late in the night, 150-mile-per-hour winds raged around them, uprooting trees and ripping away parts of the house. The storm became so severe they began to fear they would experience physical harm. Alvie, with his wife and children, his mother and his brothers and sister and their families, knelt together in the entrance hall of the home and prayed humbly to the Lord, asking for protection and for safety.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p15\" class=\"\">The next morning they viewed the devastation. Of the fifty or more large, strong oak trees that had been growing in his mother\u2019s yard, only eight remained standing. There was damage to the house, the cars, the entire city, but the family was safe. The Lord had heard their prayers and had protected them through the storm. Alvie said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know then if we would have a house to return to, but I knew we would always have a home, because our family was intact and secure.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p16\" class=\"\">President David O. McKay once said, \u201cThere is nothing temporary in the home of the Latter-day Saint.\u201d (In Conference Report, June 1919, p. 77.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p17\" class=\"\">He also stated: \u201c[One] can have a beautiful house with all the decorations that modern art can give or wealth bestow. [It] can have all the outward forms that will please the eye and yet not [be] a home. \u2026 It may be a hovel, a log hut, a tent, a wickiup, if you have the right spirit within, the true love of Christ, and love for one another\u2014fathers and mothers for the children, children for parents, husband and wife for each other\u2014you have the true life of the home that Latter-day Saints build and which they are striving to establish.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Ideals,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Improvement Era, 1953, pp. 480\u201381.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p18\" class=\"\">Today, evil forces are challenging the home as never before. If our homes are to endure, parents and children must dedicate themselves to the gospel ideals that ensure preservation of home and family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p19\" class=\"\">Dr. Pearsall expresses the opinion that families aren\u2019t failing, but we are failing the family because we have not learned how to put family life first in our world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cOur society is interfering with the family-first feature,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe are in familial bankruptcy and have fallen into the hands of receivers such as schools, businesses, recreational pursuits, and numerous institutional demands. The issue is not one of setting priorities; the issue is one of making difficult choices for the family. There can only be one number one,\u201d he stresses. \u201cIs it your family?\u201d He makes this emphatic statement: \u201cI warn you that if your family does not come first, your family will not last.\u201d (Pearsall, p. 18.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p21\" class=\"\">In homes where high ideals and gospel values are maintained, it is parents, not teachers, who lay the foundation of character and faith in the hearts of their children. If the training a child should receive in the home is neglected, neither the Church nor the school can compensate for the loss.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p22\" class=\"\">In recent instruction from the First Presidency and the Twelve, President Thomas S. Monson pointed out that \u201cthe primary responsibility for building testimonies and providing faith-building experiences in our members, including our youth, resides in the home. The Church should continue to support the determination of the family to do this.\u201d President Monson encouraged priesthood leaders to \u201cincrease their efforts to build strong, gospel-centered homes.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1990, p. 93.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p23\" class=\"\">To assist us in this vital endeavor, major changes in Church budgeting policies have been made, which Elder Boyd K. Packer said \u201cwill have the effect of returning much of the responsibility for teaching and counseling and activity to the family where it belongs. \u2026 There will be fewer intrusions into family schedules and in the family purses.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cChurch activities must be replaced by family activities.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p25\" class=\"\">Elder Packer closed his instruction by saying, \u201cIt is a course correction; it is an inspired move.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1990, p. 90.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p26\" class=\"\">Only when parents and children work together for the same high objective\u2014to put home and family first\u2014can the home be preserved as God intended.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p27\" class=\"\">Just a few weeks ago we had a special opportunity for a family get-together. A married daughter and her husband came with their three little boys for a short stay before their move from the East Coast of the United States to the West Coast. Another married daughter and her husband came with their four children from out of town to make it possible for the entire family to be together for a weekend.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p28\" class=\"\">On Sunday evening all of our family gathered in our home just to celebrate being together\u2014\u201call under one roof again,\u201d exclaimed my wife. She had planned a special program for the occasion, with the appropriate theme, \u201cMaking Memories.\u201d She had a recording of one of our daughters singing a song about memories. She had obtained copies of a particular book about the subject as a special gift for each son and daughter. To make the memory of that weekend really complete, there would be a family picture taken. Every detail about the evening had been meticulously planned. It would be certain to create a happy memory for each family member. Or would it?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p29\" class=\"\">While the beautiful song played softly in the background, the living room filled with the noise and laughter of our growing family circle. The grandchildren couldn\u2019t sit still. They giggled and teased and played happily with one another. The grownup children enjoyed each other, too, and all talked at once, it seemed, about days gone by and about the future. They laughed with each other and laughed at the antics of their children, who by now were having tickling matches on the floor or sticking little fingers into the chocolate mint cake. It had become frustrating\u2014and funny!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p30\" class=\"\">I don\u2019t know which was more frustrating or funny\u2014the family program which ended soon after it began, with Bonnie, the would-be \u201cmemory-maker,\u201d sighing, \u201cOh, what\u2019s the use? No one\u2019s listening!\u201d or the photo session, with twelve frenzied adults all trying unsuccessfully to pose eleven overactive, squirming children. Was this a family celebration? Or was it a family circus? One thing I knew, this was not the way Bonnie had intended it to be. She had wanted this time of family gathering to be meaningful and memorable.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p31\" class=\"\">A few days after everyone had gone and our house was again very quiet, a little book came for us. It was a picture book about families, and it was inscribed: \u201cTo my warm and loving, full-of-fun family\u2014every one of you,\u201d with a special note added for Mom: \u201cHere\u2019s to the wonderful chaos, the wonderful photos, the wonderful gathering place, the wonderful memories you so lovingly help to create each time we\u2019re together.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p32\" class=\"\">Later, this note from another daughter: \u201cThank you for a wonderful stay. The boys haven\u2019t been this happy in many months. It has been so nice for them to feel so loved and to have a little extra attention and spoiling. I\u2019m so glad we could all watch together as Clark learned to walk, and that he could start forming his special bonds with loving grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Our children couldn\u2019t be more blessed to have such a loving, supportive family network.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p33\" class=\"\">Another daughter wrote this:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">If you could see my house of dreams,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">No palace would it be<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">But just where I feel happiest\u2014<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">You are that home to me.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p38\" class=\"\">Within that \u201cwonderful chaos\u201d of our family all is obviously not perfect.

Donald Pinnell said of that moment, \u201cWe could tell that our home was completely engulfed in flames; and I just stopped the car at the top of the hill for a few minutes. I said to my sons, \u2018Now look, you can spend all your life storing up treasures of the earth, and you can sit on a hill and watch them go up in flames, or, you can store up the right kind of treasures and take them with you through eternity.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p44\" class=\"\">The right kind of treasures are our families and those divine attributes and qualities of character that are taught and learned in gospel-centered homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/home-first.p45\" class=\"\">May we make the necessary individual and family course corrections which will put the Lord and our families first and fill our homes with these eternal treasures.
