Two holders of the priesthood are called by their quorum president and assigned by the bishop to visit the house of each member regularly, under the title of priesthood home teachers. They are guardians of the individual and of the family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p15\" class=\"\">When I choose to talk of priesthood home teaching, I full well realize there are some activities in the Church that are more exciting and some more interesting. Perhaps even most have more appeal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p16\" class=\"\">Some time ago I was in a home after a sacrament meeting. A mother asked her teenage son how the day had gone for him. The young man, bold in truth and unhesitant as youth usually is, said, \u201cFine, except for sacrament meeting.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p17\" class=\"\">The mother inquired about sacrament meeting, and he said, \u201cWell, if we could ever survive high councilors talking about priesthood home teaching and welfare, that would be the day!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p18\" class=\"\">The humiliated mother said, \u201cWhy, David, Elder Packer here has charge of one of those programs for the whole Church.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he do something about it?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p20\" class=\"\">My boy, I am, at this very moment, doing all that I know how to do about it. Let me explain something to you. Perhaps you\u2019ll find that these two programs\u2014which are very closely related\u2014can be most interesting. But interesting or not, they are vital to your security.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p21\" class=\"\">Incidentally, young man, you can list me with that high councilor who talks of basic priesthood programs. And list with us your coach who talks about drill and exercise, and your music teacher who insists on hours of practice for but a few minutes of performance. List with us your parents, who insist that you learn to work and to pay attention to fundamental things of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p22\" class=\"\">I repeat, some activities may have much more appeal, but there is none that is more important.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p23\" class=\"\">It is interesting that things so basic are taken so for granted. For example, there is within us a coursing supply of blood delivering nourishment to sustain the body, carrying away waste materials, and armed with a protection against disease and infection. The blood supply is kept in motion by the incessant and dependable pumping of the heart. It is vital to life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p24\" class=\"\">Ordinarily, however, a sliver in the finger gets more attention and is of more concern. No one pays much thought to the beating of the heart until there is the threat that it may be interrupted or stopped. It is then that we pay attention.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p25\" class=\"\">Home teaching, strangely enough, is so taken for granted that most members pay little attention to it, participating routinely, sometimes almost with annoyance. Through it, nevertheless, there come to members of the Church a protection and a watch-care not known elsewhere.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p26\" class=\"\">Picture a man calling for his companion, generally a younger man in his teens, to spend an evening calling on the homes of five or six families. They come to bring them encouragement, to search out their spiritual needs, and to be concerned with their welfare so that everybody knows that there is somebody to call upon in time of need.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p27\" class=\"\">If illness strikes, help can be forthcoming. The children can be cared for; visits can be arranged. Here we join the priesthood home teachers with the visiting teachers from the Relief Society. Often the problem is not illness. It is a teenager with problems or a little one not coming along the way he should.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p28\" class=\"\">There can pour through this channel of priesthood home teaching a sustaining power to the limits of the resources of the Church on this earth. This is not all. There can flow through this channel a redeeming spiritual power to the limits of heaven itself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p29\" class=\"\">Through home teaching, tragedies have been averted. Sinking souls have been lifted. Material need has been provided. Grief has been assuaged. The infirm have been healed through administration. While the work goes on without being heralded, it is inspired of Almighty God and is basic to the spiritual nourishment of this people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p30\" class=\"\">The leaders of the Church expend great effort to see that priesthood home teaching works. Though it is much taken for granted, it is always provided for and always will be. The principles of it have never changed, not with changing society or the various additions to programming in the Church. Without it the Church could very quickly cease to be the Church. And I say again, though some activities may be more inviting, none is more important.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p31\" class=\"\">I am grateful for the many activity programs we have. They are a spice, a flavoring, or a dessert. They make life interesting, particularly for our young people. I am much in favor of them and would not see them neglected, nor could you persuade me to dispense with them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p32\" class=\"\">I can see that a church with home teaching only might, to a young person, be quite as dull as a meal without flavoring or dessert. However, I have some concern when our local leaders concentrate entirely on activity programs and neglect priesthood home teaching.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p33\" class=\"\">I say to our bishops, you might as well try to raise up an athlete on a diet of chocolate bars and soda pop as to attempt to sustain your youth with activity programs only. They may be drawn to them, but they will not be much nourished by them. No effort to redeem your youth can be more productive than the time and attention given to priesthood home teaching. For the object of priesthood home teaching is to strengthen the home, and as the teenager would say, and he usually knows, \u201cThat is where it is all at.\u201d Can\u2019t you see that when you keep this lifeline to the home open, not only do you strengthen the home, but you have much better, more flavorful activities?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p34\" class=\"\">There are many ways to lift our young people. We are very inventive and seem to be able to devise many exciting ways.

He decided to go south for the winter and left his trap lines in the care of a carefully trained young assistant.

Do not release the home teachers by attempting to accomplish what they should do in other ways. You may invent a thousand of them in an effort to strengthen your youth, but sooner or later you must come back to doing it His way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p40\" class=\"\">I am reminded of the scriptural declaration:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p41\" class=\"\">\u201cWho am I, saith the Lord, that have promised and not fulfilled?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p42\" class=\"\">\u201cI command and men obey not; I revoke and they receive not the blessing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p43\" class=\"\">\u201cThen they say in their hearts: This is not the work of the Lord, for his promises are not fulfilled.

I learned it as a home teacher.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p47\" class=\"\">Shortly before I was married I was assigned with an older companion to serve as home teacher to an aged little lady who was a shut-in. She was a semi-invalid, and often when we knocked on the door she would call us to come in. We would find her unable to be about and would leave our message at her bedside.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p48\" class=\"\">We somehow learned that she was very partial to lemon ice cream.

She expressed great worry over a grandchild who was to undergo a very serious operation the following day.

Then began the lesson I have never forgotten. She recounted something of her life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p52\" class=\"\">A few years after her marriage to a fine young man in the temple, when they were concentrating on the activities of young married life and raising a family, one day a letter came from \u201cBox B.\u201d (In those days a letter from \u201cBox B\u201d in Salt Lake City was invariably a mission call.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p53\" class=\"\">To their surprise they were called as a family to go to one of the far continents of the world to help open the land for missionary work.

It could perhaps be called a blue washday Monday. There had been some irritation and a disagreement. Then some biting words between husband and wife. Interestingly enough, she couldn\u2019t remember how it all started or what it was over. \u201cBut,\u201d she said, \u201cnothing would do but that I follow him to the gate, and as he walked up the street on his way to work I just had to call that last biting, spiteful remark after him.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p55\" class=\"\">Then, as the tears began to flow, she told me of an accident that took place that day, and he never returned. \u201cFor fifty years,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cI\u2019ve lived in hell knowing that the last words he heard from my lips were that biting, spiteful remark.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/the-saints-securely-dwell.p56\" class=\"\">This was the message to her young home teacher.
