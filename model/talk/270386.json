There is not a city in the United States that would have suffered such an indignity\n  for twenty-four hours.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">Our whole people were indignant, and loudly called upon our city authorities for redress<span class=\"footRef\">1<\/span> of\n  their grievances, which, if not attended to they themselves would have taken the matter into their\n  own hands, and have summarily punished the audacious wretches, as they deserved.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">The principles of equal rights that have been instilled into our bosoms from our cradles, as\n  American citizens, forbid us submitting to every foul indignity, and succumbing and pandering to\n  wretches so infamous as these.
