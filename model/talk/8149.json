For the last 11 years, I have been the youngest member of the Twelve in terms of chronological age. During my years of service, the average age of the men serving in the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has been 77 years\u2014the oldest average age of the Apostles over an 11-year interval in this dispensation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/chosen-to-bear-testimony-of-my-name.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">I have been blessed by the collective apostolic, personal, and professional experience and insight of the quorum members with whom I serve. An example from my association with Elder Robert\u00a0D. Hales highlights the remarkable opportunities I have to learn from and serve with these leaders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/chosen-to-bear-testimony-of-my-name.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">Several years ago I spent a Sunday afternoon with Elder Hales in his home as he was recovering from a serious illness. We discussed our families, our quorum responsibilities, and important experiences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/chosen-to-bear-testimony-of-my-name.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">At one point I asked Elder Hales, \u201cYou have been a successful husband, father, athlete, pilot, business executive, and Church leader. What lessons have you learned as you have grown older and been constrained by decreased physical capacity?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/chosen-to-bear-testimony-of-my-name.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">Elder Hales paused for a moment and responded, \u201cWhen you cannot do what you have always done, then you only do what matters most.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/chosen-to-bear-testimony-of-my-name.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">I was struck by the simplicity and comprehensiveness of his answer.

The very factors many may believe limit the effectiveness of these servants can become some of their greatest strengths. Physical restrictions can expand vision. Limited stamina can clarify priorities. Inability to do many things can direct focus to a few things of greatest importance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/chosen-to-bear-testimony-of-my-name.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">Some people have suggested younger, more vigorous leaders are needed in the Church to address effectively the serious challenges of our modern world. But the Lord does not use contemporary philosophies and practices of leadership to accomplish His purposes (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"131449\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131449)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131449)\">Isaiah 55:8\u20139<\/a><\/span>).

Interestingly, the mortal limitations of these men actually affirm the divine source of the revelations that come to and through them. Truly, these men are called of God by prophecy (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"131450\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131450)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131450)\">Articles of Faith 1:5<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"topic\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>A Pattern of Preparation<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/chosen-to-bear-testimony-of-my-name.p22\" class=\"\" id=\"p22\">I have observed in my Brethren at least a part of the Lord\u2019s purpose for having older men of maturity and judgment serve in senior leadership positions of the Church. These men have had a sustained season of tutoring by the Lord, whom they represent, serve, and love. They have learned to understand the divine language of the Holy Spirit and the Lord\u2019s patterns for receiving revelation. These ordinary men have undergone a most extraordinary developmental process that has sharpened their vision, informed their insight, engendered love for people from all nations and circumstances, and affirmed the reality of the Restoration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/chosen-to-bear-testimony-of-my-name.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">I have witnessed repeatedly my Brethren striving diligently to fulfill and magnify their responsibilities while struggling with serious physical problems. These men are not spared from affliction. Rather, they are blessed and strengthened to press forward valiantly while suffering in and with affliction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/chosen-to-bear-testimony-of-my-name.p24\" class=\"\" id=\"p24\">Serving with these representatives of the Lord, I have come to know their greatest desire is to discern and do the will of our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son. As we counsel together, inspiration has been received and decisions have been made that reflect a degree of light and truth far beyond human intelligence, reasoning, and experience. As we work together in unity on perplexing problems, our collective understanding of an issue has been enlarged in marvelous ways by the power of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-afternoon-session\/chosen-to-bear-testimony-of-my-name.p25\" class=\"\" id=\"p25\">I am blessed to observe on a daily basis the individual personalities, capacities, and noble characters of these leaders. Some people find the human shortcomings of the Brethren troubling and faith diminishing.
