Some are very important choices. Some are not. Many of our choices are between good and evil. The choices we make, however, determine to a large extent our happiness or our unhappiness, because we have to live with the consequences of our choices. Making perfect choices all of the time is not possible. It just doesn\u2019t happen. But it is possible to make good choices we can live with and grow from. When God\u2019s children live worthy of divine guidance they can become \u201cfree forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-24905_000_022\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43394\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43394)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43394)\">2 Ne. 2:26<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/choices.p6\" class=\"\">Sometimes we make poor choices when we yield to peer pressure. Kieth Merrill had such an experience when he was a young man. He and his friends were diving from sheer rock walls at the East Canyon Reservoir, northeast of Salt Lake City. It inevitably turned into a teenage contest when one young man climbed up to the top of the dam and dived 50 feet into the deep water of the reservoir. The rest of the young men all went to the top of the dam and made the same high dive. One boy wasn\u2019t satisfied with that, so he said, \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll do one better!\u201d He climbed 60 feet up the side of the cliff. Not wanting to be outdone, Kieth climbed up beside him. After the other boy had dived into the water and seemed to be all right, Kieth took courage and made his dive. The contest was now down to these two boys. Kieth\u2019s friend then climbed up to 70 feet and dived. He came up from the water laughing, rubbing his shoulders and his eyes. He then challenged Kieth, \u201cWell, are you going to do it?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/choices.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cOf course, I\u2019m going to do it!\u201d And everybody on the shore said, \u201cOf course, he\u2019s going to do it!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/choices.p8\" class=\"\">So Kieth swam back to the shore and climbed up the rocks. He knew if he jumped from the same height of 70 feet that his friend would want to go higher, so he scrambled up 80 feet to the very top of the cliff. No one could go any higher than the top. As Kieth looked down, he was terrified to see the water so very far away. He had made a rash decision. It was not what he wanted to do nor what he felt was right. Instead he had based his decision on the prodding and dares of a half dozen young men whose names he cannot now even remember.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/choices.p9\" class=\"\">He backed up and ran as hard as he could toward the edge. He found the mark he had carefully laid at the edge of the rock and sprang out into space. On the way down he remembered his parents teaching him to be careful when making decisions, because a wrong one could kill him. And now he thought, \u201cYou have done it, because when you hit the water you\u2019ll be going so fast that it might as well be concrete.\u201d When he hit the water, it even felt like concrete. How grateful he was when his head finally popped above water.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/choices.p10\" class=\"\">Why did he jump? What was he trying to prove? The young men who dared him didn\u2019t care and probably don\u2019t even remember that foolish act. But Kieth realized afterward that he had made what could easily have been a fatal decision. He had yielded to the pressure of friends expecting him to do what he didn\u2019t want to do. He knew better. He said: \u201cI was living in the world, and at that moment I was of the world because I was not in control of myself. I was not making decisions about my own life. The world made the decisions for me, \u2026 and [I] had barely avoided being in the world about six feet deep.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-24905_000_022\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Adapted from \u201cDeciding about Decisions,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">New Era,<\/span> June 1976, 12\u201313.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/choices.p11\" class=\"\">It takes a certain kind of courage to stand back rather than leaping forward, foolishly allowing someone else to make our choices for us.

Learning by experience has value, but the \u201cschool of hard knocks\u201d is deserving of its name. Progression comes faster and easier by learning from our parents, those who love us, and our teachers. We can also learn from the mistakes of others, observing the consequences of their wrong choices.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/choices.p13\" class=\"\">Some choices present good opportunities no matter which road we take\u2014for example, when deciding which career path to follow or which school to attend. I know one bright and able young man who wanted to become a doctor, but the opportunity did not open up for him; so he chose to follow the law. He has become a very successful lawyer, but I am satisfied he would have been equally successful as a doctor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/choices.p14\" class=\"\">Some of our important choices have a time line. If we delay a decision, the opportunity is gone forever. Sometimes our doubts keep us from making a choice that involves change. Thus an opportunity may be missed.

Oaks, then a colonel in the United States Air Force, was a member of the Incidents at Sea negotiating team. They were guests at a dinner hosted by the Leningrad Naval District. About 50 senior officers of the Soviet Union and the United States were present as the host led the group in toasts before dinner. They stood for the first toast and raised their glasses, most of which were filled with Russian vodka. Brother Oaks had pink lemonade in his glass, which was immediately noticed by the admiral leading the toast. He stopped and demanded that Brother Oaks fill his glass with vodka, stating that he would not proceed until he had done so. Brother Oaks declined, explaining that he was happy with what he had in his glass.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/choices.p19\" class=\"\">A significant tension began to build, and even his own team members, most of whom were senior to him, were growing uneasy over the impasse.

Incidentally, adhering to his religious principles did not hurt his career.
