I explained the restoration of the gospel, the difference between a restoration and a reformation, and at the conclusion of my talk I only got one question out of all these ministers and church leaders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/he-has-sent-his-messenger-to-prepare-the-way.p44\" class=\"\">The man in charge said, \u201cMr. Richards, you have told us that you believe that God is a personal God.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/he-has-sent-his-messenger-to-prepare-the-way.p45\" class=\"\">I said, \u201cThat is right.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/he-has-sent-his-messenger-to-prepare-the-way.p46\" class=\"\">He said, \u201cWe have heard it said that you believe that God has a wife.

We had the plans prepared for the Los Angeles Temple. One day we took them and showed them to the First Presidency, but we didn\u2019t have the electrical or plumbing plans completed. We had 84 pages about 4 feet long and 2 1\/2 feet wide, and I imagine you have all seen blueprints. I said, \u201cNow you could take those blueprints and try to fit them to every building in this world, but there is only one building they will fit, and that is the Mormon temple down in Los Angeles.\u201d Then I said, \u201cOf course you can find buildings that have material in them such as cement, lumber, electrical wiring, plumbing, and so forth, but you can\u2019t find any building that they will fit.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/he-has-sent-his-messenger-to-prepare-the-way.p50\" class=\"\">Then I held up the Bible.
