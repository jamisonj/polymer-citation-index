We boys were always anxious to get on the fishing stream or into the swimming hole, and we would try to push the car a little faster. In those days, the automobile my father drove was a 1928 Oldsmobile. If he went over 35 miles (56\u00a0km) an hour, my mother would say, \u201cKeep it down! Keep it down!\u201d I would say, \u201cPut the accelerator down, Dad! Put it down!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/priesthood-session\/true-shepherds.p6\" class=\"\">Dad would drive about 35 miles an hour all the way up to Provo Canyon or until we would come around a bend in the road and our journey would be halted by a herd of sheep. We would watch as hundreds of sheep filed past us, seemingly without a shepherd, a few dogs yapping at their heels as they moved along. Way back in the rear we could see the sheepherder on his horse\u2014not a bridle on it but a halter. He was occasionally slouched down in the saddle dozing, since the horse knew which way to go and the yapping dogs did the work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/priesthood-session\/true-shepherds.p7\" class=\"\">Contrast that to the scene which I viewed in Munich, Germany, many years ago. It was a Sunday morning, and we were en route to a missionary conference. As I looked out the window of the mission president\u2019s automobile, I saw a shepherd with a staff in his hand, <span class=\"emphasis\">leading<\/span> the sheep. They followed him wherever he went. If he moved to the left, they followed him to the left. If he moved to the right, they followed him in that direction. I made the comparison between the true shepherd who led his sheep and the sheepherder who rode casually behind his sheep.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/priesthood-session\/true-shepherds.p8\" class=\"\">Jesus said, \u201cI am the good shepherd, and know my sheep.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-10711_000_026\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125815\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125815)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125815)\">John 10:14<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> He provides for us the perfect example of what a true shepherd should be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/priesthood-session\/true-shepherds.p9\" class=\"\">Brethren, as the priesthood of God we have a shepherding responsibility.

They go in pairs. Where possible, a young man who is a priest or a teacher in the Aaronic Priesthood accompanies an adult holding the Melchizedek Priesthood. As they go into the homes of those for whom they are responsible, the Aaronic Priesthood holder should take part in the teaching which takes place. Such an assignment will help to prepare these young men for missions as well as for a lifetime of priesthood service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/priesthood-session\/true-shepherds.p11\" class=\"\">The home teaching program is a response to modern revelation commissioning those ordained to the priesthood \u201cto teach, expound, exhort, baptize, \u2026 and visit the house of each member, and exhort them to pray vocally and in secret and attend to all family duties, \u2026 to watch over the church always, and be with and strengthen them; and see that there is no iniquity in the church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-10711_000_026\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125816\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125816)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125816)\">Doctrine and Covenants 20:42, 47, 53\u201354<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/priesthood-session\/true-shepherds.p12\" class=\"\">President David\u00a0O.

To illustrate this point, let me share with you an experience I had some years ago. At that time the Missionary Executive Committee was comprised of Spencer\u00a0W. Kimball, Gordon\u00a0B. Hinckley, and Thomas\u00a0S. Monson. One evening Brother and Sister Hinckley hosted a dinner in their home for the committee members and our wives. We had just finished a lovely meal when there was a knock at the door. President Hinckley opened the door and found one of his home teachers standing there. The home teacher said, \u201cI know I didn\u2019t make an appointment to come, and I don\u2019t have with me my companion, but I felt I should come tonight. I didn\u2019t know you would be entertaining company.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/priesthood-session\/true-shepherds.p17\" class=\"\">President Hinckley graciously invited the home teacher to come in and sit down and to instruct three Apostles and our wives concerning our duty as members.

President Marion\u00a0G. Romney, who was a counselor in the First Presidency some years ago, used to tell about his home teacher who once went to the Romney home on a cold winter night. He kept his hat in his hand and shifted nervously when invited to sit down and give his message. As he remained standing, he said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you, Brother Romney, it\u2019s cold outside, and I left my car engine running so it wouldn\u2019t stop.
