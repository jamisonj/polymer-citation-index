Kimball gave a memorable address. He quoted an account written by Samuel T. Whitman entitled \u201cForgotten Wedges.\u201d Today I, too, have chosen to quote from Samuel T. Whitman, followed by examples from my own life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p5\" class=\"\">Whitman wrote: \u201cThe ice storm [that winter] wasn\u2019t generally destructive. True, a few wires came down, and there was a sudden jump in accidents along the highway. \u2026 Normally, the big walnut tree could easily have borne the weight that formed on its spreading limbs. It was the iron wedge in its heart that caused the damage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cThe story of the iron wedge began years ago when the white-haired farmer [who now inhabited the property on which it stood] was a lad on his father\u2019s homestead. The sawmill had then only recently been moved from the valley, and the settlers were still finding tools and odd pieces of equipment scattered about. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cOn this particular day, it was a faller\u2019s wedge\u2014wide, flat, and heavy, a foot or more long, and splayed from mighty poundings [\u2014which the lad found] \u2026 in the south pasture. [A faller\u2019s wedge, used to help fell a tree, is inserted in a cut made by a saw and then struck with a sledge hammer to widen the cut.] \u2026 Because he was already late for dinner, the lad laid the wedge \u2026 between the limbs of the young walnut tree his father had planted near the front gate. He would take the wedge to the shed right after dinner, or sometime when he was going that way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cHe truly meant to, but he never did. [The wedge] was there between the limbs, a little tight, when he attained his manhood. It was there, now firmly gripped, when he married and took over his father\u2019s farm. It was half grown over on the day the threshing crew ate dinner under the tree. \u2026 Grown in and healed over, the wedge was still in the tree the winter the ice storm came.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cIn the chill silence of that wintry night \u2026 one of the three major limbs split away from the trunk and crashed to the ground. This so unbalanced the remainder of the top that it, too, split apart and went down. When the storm was over, not a twig of the once-proud tree remained.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cEarly the next morning, the farmer went out to mourn his loss. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cThen, his eyes caught sight of something in the splintered ruin. \u2018The wedge,\u2019 he muttered reproachfully. \u2018The wedge I found in the south pasture.\u2019 A glance told him why the tree had fallen. Growing, edge-up in the trunk, the wedge had prevented the limb fibers from knitting together as they should.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-22905_000_007\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[In Conference Report, Apr. 1966, 70.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p12\" class=\"\">My dear brothers and sisters, there are hidden wedges in the lives of many whom we know\u2014yes, perhaps in our own families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p13\" class=\"\">Let me share with you the account of a lifelong friend, now departed from mortality. His name was Leonard. He was not a member of the Church, although his wife and children were. His wife served as a Primary president; his son served an honorable mission. His daughter and his son married companions in solemn ceremonies and had families of their own.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p14\" class=\"\">Everyone who knew Leonard liked him, as did I. He supported his wife and children in their Church assignments. He attended many Church-sponsored events with them. He lived a good and a clean life, even a life of service and kindness. His family, and indeed many others, wondered why Leonard had gone through mortality without the blessings the gospel brings to its members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p15\" class=\"\">In Leonard\u2019s advanced years, his health declined. Eventually he was hospitalized, and life was ebbing away. In what turned out to be my last conversation with Leonard, he said, \u201cTom, I\u2019ve known you since you were a boy. I feel persuaded to explain to you why I have never joined the Church.\u201d He then related an experience of his parents which took place many, many years before. Reluctantly, the family had reached a point where they felt it was necessary to sell their farm, and an offer had been received. Then a neighboring farmer asked that the farm be sold to him instead\u2014although at a lesser price\u2014adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve been such close friends. This way, if I own the property, I\u2019ll be able to watch over it.\u201d At length Leonard\u2019s parents agreed, and the farm was sold. The buyer\u2014even the neighbor\u2014held a responsible position in the Church, and the trust this implied helped to persuade the family to sell to him, even though they did not realize as much money from the sale as they would have if they had sold to the first interested buyer. Not long after the sale was made, the neighbor sold both his own farm and the farm acquired from Leonard\u2019s family in a combined parcel which maximized the value and hence the selling price. The long-asked question of why Leonard had never joined the Church had been answered. He always felt that his family had been deceived by the neighbor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p16\" class=\"\">He confided to me following our conversation that he felt a great burden had at last been lifted as he prepared to meet his Maker. The tragedy is that a hidden wedge had kept Leonard from soaring to greater heights.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p17\" class=\"\">I am acquainted with a family which came to America from Germany. The English language was difficult for them. They had but little by way of means, but each was blessed with the will to work and with a love of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p18\" class=\"\">Their third child was born, lived but two months, and then died. Father was a cabinetmaker and fashioned a beautiful casket for the body of his precious child. The day of the funeral was gloomy, thus reflecting the sadness they felt in their loss. As the family walked to the chapel, with Father carrying the tiny casket, a small number of friends had gathered. However, the chapel door was locked. The busy bishop had forgotten the funeral. Attempts to reach him were futile. Not knowing what to do, the father placed the casket under his arm and, with his family beside him, carried it home, walking in a drenching rain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p19\" class=\"\">If the family were of a lesser character, they could have blamed the bishop and harbored ill feelings. When the bishop discovered the tragedy, he visited the family and apologized. With the hurt still evident in his expression, but with tears in his eyes, the father accepted the apology, and the two embraced in a spirit of understanding. No hidden wedge was left to cause further feelings of anger. Love and acceptance prevailed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p20\" class=\"\">The spirit must be freed from tethers so strong and feelings never put to rest, so that the lift of life may give buoyancy to the soul. In many families, there are hurt feelings and a reluctance to forgive. It doesn\u2019t really matter what the issue was. It cannot and should not be left to injure. Blame keeps wounds open. Only forgiveness heals. George Herbert, an early 17th-century poet, wrote these lines: \u201cHe that cannot forgive others breaks the bridge over which he himself must pass if he would ever reach heaven, for everyone has need of forgiveness.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hidden-wedges.p21\" class=\"\">Beautiful are the words of the Savior as He was about to die upon the cruel cross.
