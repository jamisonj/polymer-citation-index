One is filled with water I retrieved from the Dead Sea. The other contains water from the Sea of Galilee. Occasionally I will shake one of the bottles to ensure that the water has not diminished. When I follow this practice, my mind turns to these two different bodies of water. The Dead Sea is void of life. The Sea of Galilee is filled with life and with memories of the mission of the Lord Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p8\" class=\"\">There is another body of water found throughout the Church today. I speak of the pool of prospective elders in each ward and each stake. Picture in your mind a river of water gushing into the pool. Then consider a trickle of water emerging from that stagnated pool\u2014a trickle which represents those going forward into the Melchizedek Priesthood. The pool of prospective elders is becoming larger and wider and deeper more rapidly than any of us can fully appreciate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p9\" class=\"\">It is essential, even critical, that we study the Aaronic Priesthood pathway, since far too many boys falter, stumble, then fall without advancing into the quorums of the Melchizedek Priesthood, thereby eroding the active priesthood base of the Church and curtailing the activity of loving wives and precious children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p10\" class=\"\">What can we as leaders do to reverse this trend? The place to begin is at the headwaters of the Aaronic Priesthood stream. There is an ancient proverb which purports to correctly determine the sanity of an individual. A person is shown a stream of water flowing into a stagnant pond. He is given a bucket and asked to commence to drain the pond. If he first takes steps to effectively dam the inflow to the pond, he is adjudged sane. If, on the other hand, he ignores the inflow and tries to empty the pond bucket by bucket, he is designated as insane.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p11\" class=\"\">The bishop, by revelation, is the president of the Aaronic Priesthood and is president of the priests quorum in his ward. He cannot delegate these God-given responsibilities. However, he can place accountability with those called as quorum advisers, men who can touch the lives of boys.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p12\" class=\"\">The bishop\u2019s counselors, other ward officers and teachers, and particularly the fathers and the mothers of our young men can be of immeasurable help. Also very effective can be the service rendered by Aaronic Priesthood quorum presidencies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p13\" class=\"\">This, then, is our goal: to save every young man, thereby assuring a worthy husband for each of our young women, strong Melchizedek Priesthood quorums, and a missionary force trained and capable of accomplishing what the Lord expects.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p14\" class=\"\">A wise first step is to guide each deacon to a spiritual awareness of the sacredness of his ordained calling. In one ward, this lesson was effectively taught pertaining to the collection of fast offerings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p15\" class=\"\">On fast day, the ward members were visited by deacons and teachers so that each family could make a contribution. The deacons were a bit disgruntled, having to arise earlier than usual to fulfill this assignment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p16\" class=\"\">The inspiration came for the bishopric to take a busload of the deacons and teachers to Welfare Square here in Salt Lake City. Here they saw needy children receiving new shoes and other items of clothing. Here they witnessed empty baskets being filled with groceries. There was no money exchanged. One brief comment was made: \u201cYoung men, this is what the money you collect on fast day provides\u2014even food, clothing, and shelter.\u201d The Aaronic Priesthood young men smiled more, stepped higher, and served with a willing mind in the filling of their assignments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p17\" class=\"\">A question: is every ordained teacher given the assignment to home teach? What an opportunity to prepare for a mission. What a privilege to learn the discipline of duty. A boy will automatically turn from concern for self when he is assigned to \u201cwatch over\u201d others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p18\" class=\"\">And what of the priests? These young men have the opportunity to bless the sacrament, to continue their home teaching duties, and to participate in the sacred ordinance of baptism.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p19\" class=\"\">I remember as a deacon watching the priests as they would officiate at the sacrament table. One priest by the name of Barry had a lovely voice and would read the sacrament prayers with clear diction\u2014as though he were competing in a speech contest. The other members of the ward, particularly the older sisters, would compliment him on his \u201cgolden voice.\u201d I think he became a bit proud. Jack, another priest in the ward, was hearing impaired, which caused his speech to be unnatural in its sound. We deacons would twitter at times when Jack would bless the emblems. How we dared to do so is beyond me, for Jack had hands like a bear and could have crushed any one of us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p20\" class=\"\">On one occasion Barry, with the beautiful voice, and Jack, with the awkward delivery, were assigned together at the sacrament table. The hymn was sung; the two priests broke the bread. Barry knelt to pray, and we closed our eyes. But nothing happened. Soon we deacons opened our eyes to see what was causing the delay. I shall ever remember the picture of Barry frantically searching the table for the little white card on which were printed the sacrament prayers. It was nowhere to be found. What to do? Barry\u2019s face turned pink and then crimson as the congregation began to look in his direction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p21\" class=\"\">Then Jack, with that bearlike hand, reached up and gently tugged Barry back onto the bench. He himself then knelt on the little footstool and began to pray: \u201cO God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it. \u2026\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-99905_000_023\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38781\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38781)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38781)\">Moro. 4:3<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> He continued the prayer, and the bread was passed. Jack also blessed the water, and it was passed. What respect we deacons gained that day for Jack who, though handicapped in speech, had memorized the sacred prayers! Barry, too, had a new appreciation for Jack. A lasting bond of friendship had been established.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p22\" class=\"\">Beyond the influence of the bishopric and the Aaronic Priesthood quorum advisers is the impact of the home. Help of parents, when enlisted wisely, can frequently make the difference between success and failure. A survey we conducted recently reveals that the influence of the home is a dominant factor in determining missionary service and temple marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p23\" class=\"\">I know in my experience of only three wards with a full complement of 48 priests. These wards were presided over by Joseph B. Wirthlin, Alfred B. Smith, and Alvin R. Dyer. Almost without exception, each young man filled a mission and married in the temple. One of the keys to their success was to call to service as Aaronic Priesthood advisers men who were models for the young men to follow. An ideal model is a returned missionary, fresh from his mission and filled with testimony, where a young Aaronic Priesthood holder can say, \u201cThat\u2019s the man I want to follow.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p24\" class=\"\">As we dam off that inflow of Aaronic Priesthood streaming into the pool of prospective elders, we will solve more problems than we realize. We will ensure that every young man will more likely than not go on a mission and will marry in the temple. Then there will not be that disproportionate number of worthy young women with few worthy young men to select as an eternal companion. We are not talking about a boy; we\u2019re talking about husbands, fathers, grandfathers, patriarchs to their own families. Let\u2019s put a solid foundation beneath our Aaronic Priesthood young men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p25\" class=\"\">Let us not overlook the adult converts to the Church who receive the Aaronic Priesthood but who are not ordained to the office of elder in a timely fashion. They then join the brethren who remain in that stagnant pool of inactivity. There are those wards and stakes which have rescued vast numbers of fine men who had felt trapped by no outlet in the pond. In traveling the Church, I kept records of those units which had caught the vision of this rescue effort. All of them had similar experiences. They learned that the rescue work is best done one-on-one and at the ward level. The bishop has to be involved, for isn\u2019t he the president of the Aaronic Priesthood as well as the presiding high priest of his ward?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/the-priesthood-mighty-army-of-the-lord.p26\" class=\"\">Worthy and well-prepared instructors must be called to help in such a critical effort.
