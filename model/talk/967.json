Dilworth Young, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1958, pp. 72-73<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nWith all my heart I find echo in the testimonies which have been borne yesterday and today\nrespecting the mission of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, and his relationship to the Son of God,\neven Jesus Christ.  In the same breath I wish, also, to tell President McKay, so that he can\nhear me say it, that I uphold and sustain him as a successor of Joseph Smith and a prophet of\nthe living God.  And I pledge myself, as I have in the past, to support him, his\ncounselors, and the Twelve in doing whatsoever I shall be assigned to do.\n<\/p><p>\nI say this now because I am going to do something which I dislike very much to do. For the\nfew minutes that I have I want to change the tenor of this conference and talk of something\nelse. Also, I should like to explain to you that I am going to reverse the process which I\nnormally would use. I am going to make a conclusion, and then explain the reasons for it. \nNormally I would give the reasons, and then state the conclusion.\n<\/p><p>\nIf I had a loaded gun in my closet, and ignored the possibility of my children using it, I\nwould be a derelict parent.  And if I said, in addition to that, \"Why doesn't the Church do\nsomething about it?\" I would be thought a fool, and justly, too.  If I as a father knew of a\ncondition which, though it might not be able to kill the body as a gun might, could slay my\nson's spirit eternally, and did nothing to change it, to the extent that I remained passive, the\nsin would be upon my head. Then if I should say, in addition to that, \"I cannot understand\nwhy the Church doesn't do something about it,\" I would be vain, for so far as my family is\nconcerned I am the Church. It is my responsibility to protect my family and not depend upon\nanyone else to do it.  I may ask for help from Church members and others, but I am the\nprimary protector.\n<\/p><p>\nIn 1910 I stood next to the back fence of the Lowell School with several of my classmates. A\nseventeen-year-old boy was there&mdash;we were about eleven years of age&mdash;and he was\nexhibiting a picture and bragging to us small children his enjoyment of the situation depicted\nthereon.  I need not tell you that the picture was pornographic in its nature, nor describe it\nfurther in detail.  I saw it for not more than four seconds&mdash;just that long. It has been nearly\nfifty years, and I cannot, and have not been able to forget it.  It has a way of boring itself\ninto my mind, generally during the times I especially would not want it to.\n<\/p><p>\nThe other day I was standing in a store near a magazine rack.  In front of the rack were two\nyoung men, I should judge about sixteen years of age. They each had in their hands a copy of\na magazine they had picked from that stand.  I was not so far away but what I could see at\nwhat they were looking.  One boy would turn a page, then snicker and nudge his companion\nwho would look, and then he in his turn would guffaw and in a moment or two repeat the\nprocess.\n<\/p><p>\nThey did not purchase these magazines.  After they had satiated themselves with the material\ntherein, they put them back on the rack and went out of the store.  I followed them for a\nmoment and watched them go up the street.  When they got out into the open, where they\nwere not inhibited, from the noises they made, from the laughter, and the joking and the\nkidding with each other, I would not need to have been a prophet to have been able to predict\nwhat they would do that night.\n<\/p><p>\nThose pictures in the magazines were not one whit less than what I saw fifty years ago.  How\nwidespread do you brethren think that practice is?  How far does it extend?  I would ask you.\nMy father never knew what I saw.  I never did tell him. Do you know what your sons are\nlooking at when they stop in front of drugstore, department store, other store magazine racks?\n<\/p><p>\nMay I take from the Doctrine and Covenants two verses of scripture which I am sure have not\nbeen applied to this particular thing, but which I should like to apply.  One is a prophecy and\na warning: \". . . In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of\nconspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13667\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13667)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13667)\">D&amp;C 89:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the other: \". . . inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes . . .\nthat teach them not to understand . . . the sin be upon the heads of the parents . . . And they\nshall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13642\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13642)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13642)\">D&amp;C 68:25,28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless us to become alert to probably the most insidious danger that confronts our\nboys today, I humbly ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
