Burton<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Theodore M. Burton, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1961, pp. 126-129<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brothers and sisters, I am conscious at this time of the responsibility that rests upon me. I\npray that your faith might be exercised in my behalf that it might come to me as a wave of\nfriendship, so that feeling your confidence and your love I might be able to say something\nthat will be helpful and edifying to you.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I have heard my brethren in this conference speak, these marvelous sermons, which have\nmoved me at times to tears, have made me conscious of the feeling of responsibility they have\ntried to implant in our hearts. After all, we have been chosen for a great and a noble purpose.\nWe are a chosen people, a people set apart, blessed, and ordained&mdash;in fact,\nforeordained&mdash;for a very special responsibility. Therefore, we must take this responsibility very seriously and\nrealize that we were not chosen nor set apart to rule, but chosen and set apart to serve, to be\nthe servants of all with whom we come in contact. We can best serve by teaching the divinity\nof Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I formerly began my organic chemistry lectures each fall at Utah State University, I used\nto bring to my class a small rectangular metal box. It was a breadbox, painted green, and as I\nbrought the box into the lecture room and put it on the lectern, I would turn it so that the\nstudents could see written on the front of it \"BREAD,\" and that aroused their curiosity. Every\nfall some student would accommodate me by asking \"Why the bread, Dr. Burton?\" And that\nwould give me my cue to answer, \"This is the 'bread of life' of organic chemistry.\" This\nmade them curious to know what I had in the box&mdash;sandwiches, cake, cookies, or perhaps\nactually bread for a chemical experiment.\n<\/p><p>\nLater on in the lecture, I opened the box and showed them what was in it. They were amazed\nto see that the box was filled with tinker-toys. Yes, the box was filled with balls and sticks\nand tight coils of stiff wire. In fact, they looked just like baby's playthings, and when\nyoungsters came into my laboratory, and I had to amuse them, I would actually let them play\nwith these as toys. The only difference between these toys and ordinary tinker-toys was that\nthe balls had been painted various colors&mdash;green, red, blue, purple, black, white&mdash;and that\nthe holes drilled in the balls were drilled at very precise angles.\n<\/p><p>\nChemists use these tinker-toy units to construct models of complex organic compounds. When\nI wanted to lecture, for instance, on carbohydrates to show students the structure of sugar or\nthe structure of starch or cellulose, I used these tinker-toy models to illustrate molecular\nstructure. Or when I lectured on proteins and had to show them the structure of the amino\nacids or how these were put together to form protein molecules, I used these balls and sticks\nand pieces of wire to show how the molecule was built and constructed.\n<\/p><p>\nI once heard an internationally known chemist lecture to us on the structure of enzymes. He\nused just exactly these tinker-toys, building first one part and then another part, and putting\nthe parts together until he finally showed us exactly the thing that he wanted\nto demonstrate. Now, wouldn't it be ridiculous to criticize a chemist of such stature because\nhe used such simple tools or to regard his ideas as childish because he used tinker-toy models\nto illustrate his ideas?\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the use that determines the value of a thing&mdash;on the one hand, a child's plaything, but\non the other hand a useful tool in the hands of a highly trained, competent scientist. A wise\nman looks at the results&mdash;not the tool. A simple tool in the hands of a skilled craftsman\nwould be a marvelous thing. On the other hand, the finest of hand tools, or even a machine\ntool, in the hands of a clumsy oaf would be valueless.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, speaking of tools, God did not hesitate to use simple tools wherever he had to. We are\nthe tools of God, and God has had to use men wherever he found them and as he found them.\nBut the question comes to one's mind, Why didn't God, for instance, speak to Eli, for Eli was\nat that time the prophet and high priest in ancient Israel? But Eli could not or would not do as\nhe was told. He had two sons, Hophni and Phinehas. They were heirs to the priesthood, but\nthey were profligate and wicked, and Eli could not or did not control them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2548\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2548)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2548)\">1 Sam. 2:12-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus, the Lord had to choose someone else. He chose a small lad, and as God called,\n\"Samuel,\" Samuel answered: \"Speak, for thy servant heareth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2549\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2549)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2549)\">1 Sam. 3:10<\/a><\/span>). And soon, all\nIsrael from Dan to Beersheba, knew that Samuel was a prophet of God.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen, later on, the great King Saul became disobedient and had to be set aside and replaced,\nSamuel, in his old age, because the Lord told him to go to the house of Jesse, would have\nchosen Eliab. But when he would have chosen Eliab, the Lord said to Samuel, \". . . Look not\non his countenance, or on the height of his stature, because I have refused him: for the Lord\nseeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on\nthe heart\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2550\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2550)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2550)\">1 Sam. 16:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo Abinadab, Shammah&mdash;all seven sons of Jesse were passed over, and then the Lord told\nSamuel to choose David, the shepherd lad, for he was obedient enough to listen. David was\nteachable, and so he became a useful tool in the hands of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nWhy was John the Baptist chosen to be the Elias to announce Jesus Christ? There were\ntwenty-eight high priests in Jerusalem between the years B.C. 37 and A.D. 68, yet not one of\nthese learned, highly trained, capable men was chosen. And why was not Annas chosen or his\nson-in-law, Joseph Caiaphas? Read their own judgment recorded in the words of the scriptures\nwhen they sent officers to arrest Jesus, \"Then came the officers to the chief priests and\nPharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?\n<\/p><p>\n\"The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Have any of the rulers of the Pharisees believed on him?\n<\/p><p>\n\"But the people who knoweth not the law are cursed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27969\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27969)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27969)\">John 7:45-49<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn other words, they were cursing those who believed the Son of God. In the pride of their\nlearning they were not humble enough to believe, and God could not use such people. They\nhad ears, but they could not hear. They had eyes, but they could not see. And so it was that\nGod promised that in the last days he would restore all things of the kingdom, and just as the\nLord had promised, he had to fulfil. So it came time for the Lord to keep the promise he had\nmade and restore all things, but he needed someone on earth he could trust. He needed\nsomeone he could teach.\n<\/p><p>\nWhy didn't he take the learned, trained theologians of that day&mdash;men trained in the ministry?\nFor the same reason, brothers and sisters, that many times he cannot use some of us because\nwe will not listen or we cannot listen.\n<\/p><p>\nNow hear the words of the Lord: \"But behold, verily I say unto you, that there are many who\nhave been ordained among you, whom I have called, but few of them are chosen.\n<\/p><p>\n\"They who are not chosen have sinned a very grievous sin, in that they are\nwalking in darkness at noon-day\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14037\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14037)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14037)\">D&amp;C 95:5-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd that is just exactly what many of us do, when the gospel is so light and so bright around\nus that a child could see. Many times we close our eyes and close our ears and will not see or\nlisten.\n<\/p><p>\nSo, when it came time to fulfil all things, the Lord had to choose a simple farmer boy&mdash;Joseph\nSmith&mdash;one humble enough to listen, one obedient to God, one who would not rely on his\nown wisdom, but who would be willing to learn and to obey.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, these God-chosen men that I have mentioned were not ignorant men. They were plain\nmen and untrained, but Joseph Smith, I say, was a learned man, as were those who have\nfollowed him in that office. A learned man is one well informed, one who knows the truth,\none who has great knowledge, one who has learned the truth by instruction and by study and\nby experience.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, Joseph was instructed of God, and the greater the teacher, the greater the pupil may\nbecome. So Joseph, who was instructed of God, became a very, very learned man. These men\nwe sustained at this conference as prophets, seers, and revelators, because they have been\ninstructed of God, can instruct us, if we will but listen and open our hearts.\n<\/p><p>\nI make no plea for ignorance, brothers and sisters. I do not speak against education, formal\ntraining, or formal learning. I do not urge our people to reject a university education. I do not\nbelieve that mere possession of a doctor's degree makes a man spiritually unreliable. To the\ncontrary, I speak as our Church leaders have always spoken. Get all the formal learning you\ncan afford. Remember this, brothers and sisters, we cannot teach what we do not know. Get\nall the formal learning you can possibly afford, and if possible get a terminal degree. Believe\nimplicitly in the word of the Lord as it has come to us. \"The glory of God is intelligence, or,\nin other words, light and truth\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14034\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14034)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14034)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the\nresurrection.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and\nobedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14052\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14052)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14052)\">D&amp;C 130:18-19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14056\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14056)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14056)\">D&amp;C 131:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI see before me wonderful men who have been used in this Church as bishops and stake\npresidents, members of high councils and patriarchs, members of general boards, highly\ntrained scientists both men and women. A university education, I believe, would be desirable\nfor every intelligent man and woman in the world, but I must speak the same warning that\nPaul spoke: \"Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the\ntradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10507\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10507)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10507)\">Col. 2:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brothers and sisters, I would like to stress this word, \"rudiments,\" because I think this is\na key to this passage. A rudiment means the beginning of knowledge. A little learning is a\ndangerous thing, and too many men and too many women who have become experts in a tiny\nfield of learning think that because they are trained in that field of learning, they are experts\nin all fields of learning. Many men who are well-trained in one limited field feel that this\nequally qualifies them to express learned opinions in the field of faith and religion, although\nmany of them have never done any studying nor taken a class in these subjects. So, I say that\nthe problem is not that they know too much, but that they know too much of what just isn't\nso. Actually, they know too little. They have closed their minds to anything except the\nphilosophies of men.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brothers and sisters, in our Church in this day and age, when education is becoming\nmore and more popular and more and more necessary, there is grave danger of intellectual\napostasy. The problem is that of a closed mind, as I see it. Jacob taught this beautifully, as we\nread it in the Book of Mormon.\n<\/p><p>\n\"O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and\nthe foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not\nunto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore\ntheir wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3661\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3661)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3661)\">2 Ne. 9:28-29<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat we should emphasize, \"To be learned is good.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhat causes intellectual apostasy? Why do some learned men and women turn from the faith?\nIt is not learning, for there are hundreds of us, thousands of us, equally well-trained. It isn't\nbeing exposed to different ideas, for we too were exposed to these ideas in the finest\nuniversities of the land. Why, then, do they lose their testimony? Principally out of vanity and\npride. They want to impress others with their learning. To put it indelicately, it is the problem\nof the swelled head, because that is exactly what the Prophet said.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . whoso knocketh,\" Jacob said, \"to him will he open, and the wise, and the learned, and\nthey who are rich, who are puffed up\" and that you see is just exactly what he said&mdash;\"who are\npuffed up because of their learning, and their wisdom, and their riches&mdash;yea, they are they\nwhom he despiseth; and save they shall cast these things away, and consider themselves fools\nbefore God, and come down in the depths of humility, he will not open unto them\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3662\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3662)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3662)\">2 Ne. 9:42<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow remember, it isn't the simplicity of the tool that determines its value, but the skill of the\nworkman who uses that tool. God, I am sure, would prefer to use the most skilled, the most\nable, the best-trained person that he could find, but that person must be humble and he must\nbe teachable, and he must be willing to learn something new. We, with all our learning, stand\njust at the threshold of things that we need to know, just at the beginning of wisdom, with the\nrudiments of wisdom in our hands. As Paul taught, the workman is more important than the\ntool.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For ye see your calling, brethren,\" he said, \"how that not many wise men after the flesh, not\nmany mighty, not many noble, are called: \n<\/p><p>\n\"But . . . God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are\nmighty; \n<\/p><p>\n\" . . . that no flesh should glory in his presence.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness,\nand sanctification, and redemption\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"330\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 330)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(330)\">1 Cor. 1:26-27,29-30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOver the library of the Utah State University stands in big gold letters a statement taken from\nthe scriptures: \"Get wisdom, and with all thy getting get understanding\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41437\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41437)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41437)\">Prov. 4:7<\/a><\/span>). We must\nfeed the spirit as well as the mind and as well as the body. I plead with our youth, get\nlearning, and with all your getting get understanding. Get learning of the spirit. Get learning\nof the mind. Get learning of the soul, and become a rounded man or a rounded woman,\nlearned in all ways, for I testify to you this day that security, true security, comes from a\nknowledge of the divinity of Jesus Christ. This is the beginning of all learning and of all\nwisdom. This is the greatest knowledge, the greatest learning, the greatest comfort that men\ncan have. If men have this knowledge in their hearts, they can withstand all the vicissitudes of\nlife. No trial, no trouble can come, but that a man or a woman can withstand it. He can rise\nvictorious if he has a love of Christ and a testimony of his divinity burning in his heart.\n<\/p><p>\nI testify to you that I know that Jesus has risen from the dead; that he lives and exists at this\npresent time, that he reveals himself, has revealed himself, and continues to reveal himself to\nhis servants, the prophets. I honor and sustain them, and pledge my loyalty to them, and bear\nthis testimony to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
