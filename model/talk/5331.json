They help us to better understand the course He has designed as a sure guide to lead us through this period of our mortal probation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p6\" class=\"\">Until recently, part of my assignment has included the country of Peru, an area of the world that is experiencing great turmoil. Inflation and internal strife have been robbing from the Peruvian people almost any hope of stability in their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p7\" class=\"\">It has been difficult for my Brethren and me to visit Peru regularly because of the dangers of traveling there. It has been necessary for the Peruvian members to assume much more responsibility for priesthood and auxiliary leadership and for full-time missionary service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p8\" class=\"\">The Area Presidency recognized the need to fortify the members of the Church in this country, and after much prayer and fasting, decided to emphasize just two basic teachings of the gospel. They prepared a letter to be delivered to each family unit in Peru. The theme was \u201cBeing Converted to the Lord,\u201d in which they stressed family prayer and family scripture study.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p9\" class=\"\">The Area Presidency taught these principles first to the stake presidencies. They, in turn, instructed their high councils, and from there the teaching was done to bishops. The bishops then instructed their ward members, and a follow-up letter was delivered by the home teachers to each family unit. The fathers were encouraged specifically to lead their families in daily prayer and scripture study.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p10\" class=\"\">The blessings that have come to the Peruvian Saints from practicing these two basic gospel principles, daily prayer and scripture study, have been most remarkable. It soon became evident that faith and testimony were increasing among members of the Church there. There has been a significant increase in sacrament meeting attendance, which has resulted in a greater sense of community and increased interest among the Saints in loving and caring for each other. Though travel to the temple has become increasingly difficult and dangerous, surprisingly, temple attendance is up significantly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p11\" class=\"\">The number of full-time missionaries immediately began to increase. Now the five missions in Peru fill their missionary needs with native Peruvians. The full-time missionaries are arriving in the field better prepared to serve, which of course has resulted in increased convert baptisms.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p12\" class=\"\">A renewed emphasis on two basic gospel practices\u2014daily prayer and scripture study\u2014created a dramatic change and offered increased spirituality and works among the Saints there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p13\" class=\"\">The success of the Peruvian Saints should teach all of us the importance of adhering to the basics of a gospel-centered life. Let us consider again the blessings promised us if we faithfully practice daily family prayer and daily family scripture study.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p14\" class=\"\">The scriptures are filled with admonitions to stay close to the Lord and call upon His holy name in prayer. In the latter days of Alma\u2019s ministry, he instructed his sons on how they should live. After Alma\u2019s remarkable conversion, he spent his life proclaiming the gospel and perfecting the Saints. Before he died, he wanted to instill in his sons a desire to be obedient to God\u2019s will. To Helaman he said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cO, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cYea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cCounsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10031\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10031)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10031)\">Alma 37:35\u201337<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p18\" class=\"\">Prayer is the primary means of communication between God and man. Prayer is an important part of practically every religion, whether it be Christian or otherwise. The Prophet Joseph Smith, speaking on the subject of prayer, stated:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cWe would say to the brethren, seek [till you] know God in your closets, call upon him in the fields. Follow the directions of the Book of Mormon, and pray over, and for your families, your cattle, your flocks, your herds, your corn, and all things that you possess; ask the blessing of God upon \u2026 your labors, and everything \u2026 you engage in.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 5:31.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p20\" class=\"\">When we pray to the Lord, we should remember who we are addressing and be prepared to give Him our undivided attention as we humbly supplicate before Him. President John Taylor counseled us this way:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cDo you have prayers in your family? \u2026 And when you do, do you go through the operation like the [grinding] of a piece of machinery, or do you bow in meekness and with \u2026 sincere desire to seek the blessing of God upon you and your household? That is the way \u2026 we ought to do, and cultivate a spirit of devotion and trust in God, dedicating ourselves to him, and seeking his blessings.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 21:118.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p22\" class=\"\">As parents, it is clearly our duty to teach our children to pray, and regular family prayers establish patterns that literally bless future generations. As Elder Dallin H. Oaks admonished us to do in his great talk in the morning session, it is well to use the sacred pronouns of the scriptures, <span class=\"emphasis\">Thee, Thou, Thy,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">Thine<\/span>, when addressing deity in prayer, instead of the more common pronouns <span class=\"emphasis\">you, your,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">yours.<\/span> By doing so, we show greater respect to our Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p23\" class=\"\">It is so satisfying to know that God is mindful of us and ready to respond when we place our trust in Him. There is no place for fear among men and women who place their trust in the Almighty, who do not hesitate to humble themselves in seeking divine guidance through prayer. Though difficulties may arise and reverses may come, in our prayers we can find reassurance as the Lord speaks peace to our souls.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/back-to-gospel-basics.p24\" class=\"\">On several occasions President Benson has shared the poem \u201cPrayer,\u201d by Eliza M.
