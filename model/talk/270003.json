My interest was initially sparked in the classes of Hyrum L. Andrus when I was an\n  undergraduate student at Brigham Young University. I always appreciated the Prophet&rsquo;s usage of\n  the scriptures, and would occasionally note a few scriptural references in the margins of my copy\n  of the <i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith.<\/i><\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">In November, 1989, I decided it was time to formally catalog these marginal notes and hunt\n  up what scriptural references remained. I contacted a friend in the Ancient Scripture Department,\n  Monte S. Nyman, and asked if he had any scriptural references in his copy of the Teachings which\n  might save me a little time. Mont gave me a list containing 700 entries. I was sure the task was\n  nearly done.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">As with so many things, the little project began to take on a life of its own. My first careful\n  reading of the <i>Teachings<\/i> resulted in 2,000 scriptural references. In addition, I discovered that many\n  of the phrases and passages of the <i>Teachings,<\/i> although not quoting verbatim, were extremely useful\n  in the interpretation of many other scriptures, and vice versa. Several readings have transpired since,\n  and the final count now stands at over 11,000 references, both direct and contextual. Doubtless there\n  are others.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">I also found that the line between scripture cited and scriptural concept noted became\n  increasingly blurred as my appreciation of the Prophet&rsquo;s scriptural prowess grew. When asked if he\n  stole his wife, the Prophet once replied &ldquo;Ask her, she was of age, she can answer for herself&rdquo; (<i>Teachings<\/i>,\n  p. 120). In a strict sense, this is not a scriptural citation. But after experiencing the Prophet&rsquo;s\n  scriptural genius time and again, I am persuaded that a clever use was made of John 9:21. In this\n  passage, the parents of the man born blind, seeking to avoid excommunication (John 9:22), replied\n  to the Pharisees, &ldquo;he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.\"<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">A brief sampling of the Prophet&rsquo;s scriptural usage, including a basis for this ability from his\n  life experiences, is included in the Appendix. It is hoped that the present work highlights one of the\n  great contributions of the Prophet Joseph Smith, that of &ldquo;expounding all scriptures unto the church\"\n  (D&amp;C 24:5).<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">The <i>Scriptural Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i> has benefitted from the contributions\n  of friends and family. My wife Sandy, and children James, Jennifer, Daniel, Stefanie, and Michelle\n  have patiently allowed me to see an idea through to fruition. The Department of Family Sciences\n  at Brigham Young University (Terrance D. Olson, Chairman) has tolerated my wide range of\n  research interests and generously provided computer equipment. Specialty Reference Retrieval (Paul\n  M. Urie, Mark L. Donaldson, Richard C. Galbraith) provided Retriever, a computer text retrieval program, which\n  greatly aided in the identification of scriptural references. Don E. Norton of the English Department,\n  Brigham Young University, has been most helpful in editing my nonscriptural material.\n  Finally, two women have greatly influenced my love of the scriptures and the restored gospel\n  of Jesus Christ. My angel grandmother, Harriet Amanda Davis, raised me as a child to appreciate\n  the abundant life contained in the scriptures (John 10:10). Her life was &ldquo;seasoned with grace&rdquo; (<i>Teachings,<\/i>\n  p. 156, Col. 4:6). Truly, &ldquo;She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of\n  kindness&rdquo; (Prov. 31:26; Eph. 4:32). Louise O. Belnap, a dear friend, was a saint &ldquo;instructed unto the\n  kingdom of heaven who freely brought forth of her treasure goodly pearls, new and old&rdquo; (Matt.\n  13:45, 52; Matt. 10:8).<\/p>\n<\/div>"}
