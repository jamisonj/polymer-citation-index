As you reach certain milestones in your life, it is helpful and instructive to reflect on the events and experiences of the past. You young people listening to or reading this talk may not be too impressed with 90 years of life, but at the time I was born, living this long was considered a great achievement. Every day I am grateful to Heavenly Father for blessing me with a long life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p6\" class=\"\">So much has changed during my lifetime. I have seen the development of the industrial age and the information age. Mass-produced automobiles and telephones and airplanes were great innovations of my early days. Today the way we find, share, and use information changes almost daily. At my age I marvel at the rapidly changing world in which we all live. So many of today\u2019s breakthroughs excite the imagination with their potential to better our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p7\" class=\"\">Through all the fast-paced changes occurring around us, we earnestly pray and work to ensure that the values of the gospel of Jesus Christ endure. Already some of them are in jeopardy of being lost. At the top of the list of these values and, therefore, prime targets of the adversary, are the sanctity of marriage and the central importance of families. They provide an anchor and the safe harbor of a home where each child of a loving Heavenly Father can be influenced for good and acquire eternal values.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p8\" class=\"\">My own family, anticipating the celebration of this 90-year milestone in my life, started helping me remember and appreciate the experiences of my long life. For example, my niece gathered and shared with me several letters that I had written to my parents nearly 70 years ago from my marine outpost on the island of Saipan in the Pacific during World War\u00a0II.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p9\" class=\"\">One of these letters particularly caught my eye. It was a letter I wrote to my mother for her to open and read on Mother\u2019s Day 1945. I would like to share some excerpts with you in the hope you will see why I will ever be grateful to my loving father and mother for the lessons I learned from their teaching in the home. My parents are the defining example I retain of goodly parents who placed their marriage and the proper rearing of children as their highest priority.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p10\" class=\"\">My Mother\u2019s Day 1945 letter began:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cDear Mom,<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cFor the last four years I have had the great misfortune of spending Mother\u2019s Day away from you.

First of all, I miss the little things you used to do for me. Whenever I got out of bed in the morning, I never had to worry about whether I\u2019d find a clean shirt and clean socks. All that I had to do is open a drawer, and I would find them. At mealtime I always knew that I would find something I liked, prepared the best way possible. At night I always knew that I would find clean sheets on my bed and just the right amount of covers to keep me very comfortable. Living at home was really a great pleasure.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p14\" class=\"\">When I read these first two paragraphs of the letter, I was shocked by how sentimental they sounded.

Life was made so enjoyable for us as a family that we wanted to follow in your footsteps, to continue on through experiencing the same joy that had been ours in our younger days. You always found time to take the family into the canyon, and we could count on you to do anything from climbing mountains to playing ball with us. You and Dad were never going on vacations alone. The family was always with you. Now that I am away from home, I always like to talk about my home life because it was so enjoyable. I couldn\u2019t turn from your teachings now because my actions would reflect on your character. Life is a great challenge to me to be worthy to be called the son of Nora Sonne Perry.

There is a unique gospel culture, a set of values and expectations and practices common to all members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This gospel culture, or way of life, comes from the plan of salvation, the commandments of God, and the teachings of living prophets. It is given expression in the way we raise our families and live our individual lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p22\" class=\"\">The first instruction to Adam for his mortal responsibility is found in <span class=\"citation\" id=\"123307\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123307)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123307)\">Genesis 2:24<\/a><\/span>: \u201cTherefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p23\" class=\"\">The joining together of a man and a woman to be legally and lawfully wed not only is preparation for future generations to inherit the earth, but it also brings the greatest joy and satisfaction that can be found in this mortal experience. This is especially true when the powers of the priesthood proclaim a marriage to be for time and for all eternity. Children born to such marriages have a security that is found nowhere else.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p24\" class=\"\">Lessons taught in the home by goodly parents are becoming increasingly important in today\u2019s world, where the influence of the adversary is so widespread. As we know, he is attempting to erode and destroy the very foundation of our society\u2014the family. In clever and carefully camouflaged ways, he is attacking commitment to family life throughout the world and undermining the culture and covenants of faithful Latter-day Saints. Parents must resolve that teaching in the home is a most sacred and important responsibility. While other institutions such as church and school can assist parents to \u201ctrain up a child in the way he [or she] should go\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"123308\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 123308)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(123308)\">Proverbs 22:6<\/a><\/span>), this responsibility ultimately rests on the parents.

Let me suggest five things parents can do to create stronger family cultures:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p26\" class=\"\">First, parents can pray in earnest, asking our Eternal Father to help them love, understand, and guide the children He has sent to them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p27\" class=\"\">Second, they can hold family prayer, scripture study, and family home evenings and eat together as often as possible, making dinner a time of communication and the teaching of values.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p28\" class=\"\">Third, parents can fully avail themselves of the Church\u2019s support network, communicating with their children\u2019s Primary teachers, youth leaders, and class and quorum presidencies. By communicating with those who are called and set apart to work with their children, parents can provide essential understanding of a child\u2019s special and specific needs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p29\" class=\"\">Fourth, parents can share their testimonies often with their children, commit them to keep the commandments of God, and promise the blessings that our Heavenly Father promises His faithful children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p30\" class=\"\">Fifth, we can organize our families based on clear, simple family rules and expectations, wholesome family traditions and rituals, and \u201cfamily economics,\u201d where children have household responsibilities and can earn allowances so that they can learn to budget, save, and pay tithing on the money they earn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/11\/becoming-goodly-parents.p31\" class=\"\">These suggestions for creating stronger <span class=\"emphasis\">family cultures<\/span> work in tandem with the culture of the Church.
