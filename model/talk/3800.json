What a magnificent example he has been for all of us. He has given impetus to this work in a remarkable way. The whole Church has quickened its pace and lengthened its stride in response to his clarion call. He has been a prophet to us, a prophet whose vision and revelation have reached out to the people of the entire earth, regardless of nation, or color, or station in life, freely offering the matchless blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ to all who will accept. He sends his love and blessing to all of you. I was with him yesterday, and he did so. We love him and we pray for him.

I give you my assurance that the work in the office of the First Presidency is current and up-to-date. Nothing is being neglected, and action is not being postponed. We are operating under direct assignment and authorization from the President of the Church, with whom we frequently meet. It is so also with the work of the Twelve, the Seventy, the Bishopric, and the auxiliary organizations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/he-slumbers-not-nor-sleeps.p17\" class=\"\">We thank the Lord, whose cause this is, for the marvelous growth now being experienced.

He was at the time young and vigorous, one whose mind was not set in the traditions of his day. His was a youthful mind which the Lord could mold as fresh, moist clay as he initiated his work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/he-slumbers-not-nor-sleeps.p21\" class=\"\">Joseph\u2019s successor was relatively young when he was faced with the terrible responsibility of leading an entire people across the wilderness to pioneer a new land.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/he-slumbers-not-nor-sleeps.p22\" class=\"\">But the basics of our doctrine are now well in place, and we are firmly established as a people, at least until the Lord should mandate another move.

We shall never be left without a prophet if we will live worthy of one. He does not need to be youthful. He has and will continue to have younger men to travel over the earth in the work of the ministry. He is the presiding high priest, the repository of all of the keys of the holy priesthood, and the voice of revelation from God to his people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/he-slumbers-not-nor-sleeps.p23\" class=\"\">There is an old proverb which says, \u201cYouth for action.

He makes no mistakes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/he-slumbers-not-nor-sleeps.p26\" class=\"\">I have had some opportunity to observe this remarkable process at work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/he-slumbers-not-nor-sleeps.p27\" class=\"\">Today is an anniversary for me. It was at the April general conference twenty-five years ago that I was first sustained a General Authority, an Assistant to the Twelve. Great and impressive to me have been my opportunities during this past quarter of a century. My assigned ministry has taken me over the earth to many lands, to various places where I have seen with my own eyes both peace and war, both prosperity and terrible poverty, both liberty and oppression. I have witnessed the miracles that come with faith. I have seen the evidences of true goodness and greatness in men and women living under a great variety of circumstances. I have observed in a very intimate and wonderful way the workings of the power of the Almighty among his children. I have noted the factors which lead to success or otherwise in the growth of the Church and the development of its members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/he-slumbers-not-nor-sleeps.p28\" class=\"\">When I became a General Authority twenty-five years ago, there were 251 stakes in the Church. Today there are 1,402. Then there were 2,362 wards and independent branches. We now have 13,616. The statistics read in that 1958 conference indicated a membership on December 31, 1957, of 1,488,000. The comparable figure for December 31, 1982, was 5,165,000. Marvelous has been the growth. To use the vernacular, \u201cWe must be doing something right.\u201d No, we have not done it.

Its strength and power lie in the ability of every member and every earnest investigator to know for himself or herself by the power of the Holy Spirit that it is true. Critics may wear out their lives in trying to deny or demean or cast doubt, but all who ask of God in faith have the assurance that by the voice of the Spirit will come the certainty that this work is divine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/he-slumbers-not-nor-sleeps.p30\" class=\"\">We need not fear the future if we hold fast to revealed principles. On one occasion the Prophet Joseph Smith said: \u201cGo in all meekness, in sobriety, and preach Jesus Christ and Him crucified; not to contend with others on account of their faith, or systems of religion, but pursue a steady course.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 2:431.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/he-slumbers-not-nor-sleeps.p31\" class=\"\">I like those words, \u201cpursue a steady course.\u201d I hope that we shall never forget them. The Church has grown consistently stronger because those who have gone before us have pursued a steady course. There are those who would fracture our strength by leading us in the pursuit of objectives which are not pertinent to the central mission of the Church. We are constantly invited, yes, even strongly urged, to get out and march with others for this cause or that cause. There are some causes with which we properly should be involved, which are directly related to the Church, its mission, and the well-being of its people. The determination of these must be left to those who have been called to leadership. Such causes will be few, since we must husband our strength and resources for the far greater obligation to pursue a steady course in building the kingdom of God in the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/he-slumbers-not-nor-sleeps.p32\" class=\"\">Our great, basic message to the world is that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God; that he gave his life as a sacrifice for all mankind; that he rose from the grave that first Easter morning, \u201cthe firstfruits of them that slept\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"719\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 719)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(719)\">1 Cor. 15:20<\/a><\/span>); that \u201cas in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"720\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 720)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(720)\">1 Cor. 15:22<\/a><\/span>); that he lives, our resurrected Lord and Master.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/he-slumbers-not-nor-sleeps.p33\" class=\"\">As has been said before from this pulpit, he has given us a three-fold mission: first, the teaching of the restored gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; second, the building of the Saints in their faith and encouraging them in all of their activities to walk in obedience to the commandments of the Lord; and third, the great work of salvation for the dead. This vast mission contemplates all generations of mankind\u2014those who have gone before, all who live upon the earth, and those who will yet be born. It is larger than any race or nation or generation. It encompasses all mankind. It is a cause without parallel. The fruits of its labors are everlasting in their consequences.
