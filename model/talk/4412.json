Have you ever wondered concerning the potential which lies within each of us?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p4\" class=\"\">Early in my service as a member of the Council of the Twelve, I was attending the conference of the Monument Park West Stake in Salt Lake City. My companion for the conference was a member of the General Church Welfare Committee, Paul C. Child. President Child was a student of the scriptures. He had been my stake president during my Aaronic Priesthood years. Now we were together as conference visitors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p5\" class=\"\">When it was his opportunity to participate, President Child took the Doctrine and Covenants and left the pulpit to stand among the priesthood to whom he was directing his message.

Instead, he selected the president of an elders quorum\u2014a brother who had been a bit drowsy and had missed the significance of the question.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p9\" class=\"\">The startled man responded: \u201cBrother Child, could you please repeat the question?\u201d The question was repeated: \u201cWhat is the worth of a human soul?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p10\" class=\"\">I knew President Child\u2019s style. I prayed fervently for that quorum president. He remained silent for what seemed like an eternity and then declared: \u201cBrother Child, the worth of a human soul is its capacity to become as God.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p11\" class=\"\">All present pondered that reply. Brother Child returned to the stand, leaned over to me, and said: \u201cA profound reply; a profound reply!\u201d He proceeded with his message, but I continued to reflect on that inspired response.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p12\" class=\"\">To reach, to teach, to touch the precious souls whom our Father has prepared for His message is a monumental task.

As early as April of 1830, Phineas Young received a copy of the Book of Mormon from Samuel Smith, brother of the Prophet, and a few months later traveled to Upper Canada. At Kingston, he gave the first known testimony of the restored Church beyond the borders of the United States.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p25\" class=\"\">In 1833, the Prophet Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, and Freeman Nickerson traveled to Mount Pleasant, Upper Canada. There they taught, they baptized, they organized a branch of the Church. At one time, in June of 1835, six of the Twelve held a conference in that land.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p26\" class=\"\">In April of 1836, Elder Heber C. Kimball and others entered the home of Parley P.

It rarely comes at a convenient time. It brings humility, it provokes prayer, it inspires commitment. The call came\u2014to Kirtland. Revelations followed. The call came\u2014to Missouri. Persecution prevailed. The call came\u2014to Nauvoo. Prophets died. The call came\u2014to the basin of the Great Salt Lake. Hardship beckoned.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p29\" class=\"\">That long journey, made under such difficult circumstances, was a trial of faith. But faith forged in the furnace of trials and tears is marked by trust and testimony.

The program was entitled \u201cDeath Valley Days.\u201d The narrator, known as the Old Ranger, seemed to come right into our living rooms as he would tell the tales of the West.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p32\" class=\"\">On one program, the Old Ranger related how the glass was obtained for the windows of the St. George Tabernacle. The glass had been manufactured in the East. Then it had been placed on a ship in New York, which sailed forth on the long and at times perilous journey around Cape Horn and up to the West Coast of America. The precious glass, stored in cartons, was then transported to San Bernardino, California, to await the overland trek to St. George.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p33\" class=\"\">David Cannon and the brethren in St. George had the duty to go to San Bernardino with their teams and wagons to retrieve the glass, that the tabernacle of the Lord could be completed. One problem: They needed the then-astronomical sum of $800 to pay for the glass. They had no money. David Cannon turned to his wife and his son and asked, \u201cDo you think that we can raise the money, that we might obtain the glass for the tabernacle?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p34\" class=\"\">His tiny boy, David, Jr., said, \u201cDaddy, I know we can!\u201d He then produced two cents of his own money and gave it to his father. Wilhelmina Cannon, David\u2019s wife, went through the secret hiding places that all women have in their houses. Her search produced $3.50 in silver. The community was scoured for money, and at length the sum of $200 was accumulated\u2014$600 short of the required amount.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p35\" class=\"\">David Cannon sighed the sigh of despair of one who had failed although he had tried his best. The little family was really too weary to sleep and too discouraged to eat, so they prayed. Morning dawned. There gathered the teamsters with their wagons and teams, prepared to undertake the long journey to San Bernardino. But they had no $600.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p36\" class=\"\">Then there came a knock at the door, and Peter Nielsen, from the nearby community of Washington, entered the house. He said to David Cannon, \u201cBrother David, I have had a persistent dream that I should bring the money that I had saved to expand my house\u2014bring it to you, that you would have a purpose for it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p37\" class=\"\">While all of the men gathered around the table, including little David, Jr., Peter Nielsen took out a red bandanna and dropped gold pieces, one by one, upon the table. When David Cannon counted the gold pieces, they totaled $600\u2014the exact amount needed to obtain the glass. Within an hour the men waved good-bye and, with their teams, set forth on their journey to San Bernardino to retrieve the glass for the tabernacle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p38\" class=\"\">When that true story was told on \u201cDeath Valley Days,\u201d young David Cannon, Jr., was then eighty-seven years of age. He listened to the story with rapt attention. I feel that in his mind, he once again heard those gold pieces, one by one, dropping upon the table as astonished men saw with their very eyes the answer to their prayers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/tears-trials-trust-testimony.p39\" class=\"\">Tabernacles and temples are built with more than stone and mortar, wood and glass.
