I presume modern Israel is also included under the same injunction, for surely the Lord used almost the same words when he warned of the burning that would precede his second coming, and tithing seems to be the critical judgment criterion.

We do not always know how the Lord will bless us.

But then he does speed up\u2014just enough to get through on the yellow light\u2014and you have to stop. This has a great tendency to test the patience. Sometimes we even start thinking rather derogatorily about him as he drives away. However, it just may be that the Lord is protecting us from an accident two miles down the road because we stopped at that light, even though we did it reluctantly. If you entertain these kinds of thoughts, it may have a tendency to make you thankful instead of irate or angry, which is much better for your digestion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/that-ye-may-have-roots-and-branches.p8\" class=\"\">I had this principle vividly impressed upon me one day a long time ago. I was living back in Virginia at the time, and one beautiful fall day I drove out into the country to pick up some walnuts. There were sixteen Stop signs between my home and the very, very heavily wooded lane where I turned in to get those walnuts. I stopped fifteen times. The last Stop sign was way out in the country. I could see in both directions. There were no other cars in sight. I thought to myself: \u201cWhy should I stop? Stop signs are to protect people, but I am the only one around. So why stop?\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">So I didn\u2019t!<\/span> I wasn\u2019t speeding. I just went through at the speed limit. When I reached the heavily wooded lane, I found I couldn\u2019t see around the corner. It\u2019s that way back there in Virginia. So I slowed down and turned in. Just as I did, there was another car coming out of the lane, and because we couldn\u2019t see each other, we ran together at about five miles per hour. It wasn\u2019t a hard impact and the cars weren\u2019t severely damaged. As I recall, it only cost me $168 to replace my grill and headlights.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/that-ye-may-have-roots-and-branches.p9\" class=\"\">Now, that accident had to be perfectly timed. Of course, if I had stopped at the last Stop sign, it would never have happened. I said, \u201cLord, I get the message. You really didn\u2019t have to go this far, but I do understand.\u201d In fact, I stopped sixteen times on the way home with the front end of my car beat up.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/that-ye-may-have-roots-and-branches.p10\" class=\"\">It does seem that the Lord requires obedience in order for us to receive his blessings, which include rebuking the devourer. \u201cThere is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> blessings are predicated.\u201d When we receive a blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.
