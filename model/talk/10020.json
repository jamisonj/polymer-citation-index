D. Watt.<\/div>\n<div class=\"pageHeader\">Page Header: Duties and Privileges, Etc.<\/div>\n<div class=\"speaker\">Speaker: Brigham Young<\/div>\n<div class=\"date\">Date: 2\/27\/1853<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"discourseBody\" id=\"d20\">\n<div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n605\"> I arise to make a few remarks, upon the subject on which brother Hyde was speaking, concerning the privileges of the Saints. I think that he has plainly shown us, that privileges are, in a measure, disconnected with duties; and although we may not exercise ourselves in all of them that we might, still, we shall not fall under condemnation for this neglect. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n606\"> The privileges of the Saints of God, and that are granted unto the inhabitants of the earth, are founded upon the principles of truth and righteousness; but many people use them to their own condemnation; yet, if they knew how to receive and act upon them, there would be no condemnation, but to the contrary, a blessing. This remark applies not only to the privilege of dancing (for such it is), that has been spoken of this morning, but to all other acts and privileges that exist, and still are not specifically pointed out by revelation as duties or requirements. All blessings of this nature are to be used as such, understandingly, by the Saints, and upon righteous principles. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n607\"> What are the privileges of the Saints in these valleys? Are they abridged in the least? Can they not accumulate wealth by trading with each other with emigrants, by cultivating the soil, raising stock, going to the mines and digging for gold&#x2014;in short, pursuing any and every avocation to increase in wealth, and accumulate unto themselves the things of this world? Still further, <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"112b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD01\/JoD01_0112.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;112b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1799\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> if they wish to act upon unrighteous principles, they can take advantage of their neighbor's necessity, ask extortionate prices for rendering any little-assistance or service, and after thus dishonestly filling their purses, go to the gambling table, or grog shop, and spend it by getting drunk, and rolling in the streets. Almost numberless indeed are the privileges and blessings of the human family, and their abuses co-extensive therewith. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n608\"> But when blessings and privileges are to be used by the Saints, it should be so as not to bring condemnation. Upon what principle, when, and where may we use them? I have the privilege of associating myself with my brethren and sisters in the dance. When can I do this without abusing this privilege, and thereby bringing condemnation upon myself? I answer, it is when I have performed every act, every duty that is incumbent upon me, when every necessary labor and requirement is accomplished, when I have served my God and my brethren, when I have performed every act required of me, <span class=\"italic\">until nothing remains to be done, but to lie down and rest<\/span>, to seek recreation, then it becomes my lawful privilege, and not before. I fear this is quite different from the practice of many. I also, as well as others, could act upon unrighteous principles, if I would, and neglect my duties pertaining to life and salvation. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n609\"> Suppose you go into some of the wards and say, &#x201C;we have obtained  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"113a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD01\/JoD01_0113.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;113a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1798\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>some music, let us go into the schoolhouse and have a dance.&#x201D; &#x201C;O yes!&#x201D; is the ready response, and they will immediately prepare, get ready their sons and their daughters, and, leaving all important duties pertaining to their welfare here and hereafter, unattended to, fill the house to overflowing. Brethren, you will use these privileges to your own destruction, if you are not careful. Yes, you could have a full house, dancing attendance to the sounds of <span class=\"italic\">revelry<\/span> and <span class=\"italic\">music<\/span>; but, on the other hand, suppose your invitation is to your neighbor, &#x201C;Come, brethren, sisters, we are going to have a prayer meeting over at the schoolhouse. Will you go? Will you come? Not to dance, but to pray!&#x201D; &#x201C;Well, really, I do not see how I can; my work is not done; I have a few chores [trifling domestic affairs] to do yet; I have agreed to go to a neighbor's on business; a neighbor promised to call on me tonight, and I cannot well leave. I should like very much to go, but I really do not see that I can tonight.&#x201D; In short, excuses are not wanting. I say to you, my brethren, and to myself, if we take this course, condemnation is our doom, we will ruin, condemn ourselves, and the Lord Almighty will judge us out of our own mouths.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124573\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124573)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124573)\">Luke 19:22<\/a><\/span> This is the tale told as it is.

Then, and not until then, does it become the privilege of you, of me, or of any of the Saints, to join in the festivities designed by our Creator for our recreation. I wish that you would remember it; and that you may, I repeat that it is not your lawful privilege to yield to anything in the shape of amusement, <span class=\"italic\">until you have performed every duty, and obtained the power of God<\/span> to enable you to withstand and resist all foul spirits that might attack you, and lead you astray; until you have command over them, and by your faith, obtained, through prayer and supplication, the blessings of the Holy Spirit, and it rests upon, and abides continually with you. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n614\"> You can never obtain my consent to engage in amusements and recreations, until you are in this situation, until you are exercised and influenced by the Spirit of the Lord our God. <span class=\"italic\">Hear it, all ye Latter-day Saints!

But if you submit to serve your own feelings, and if you desire not to build up the kingdom of God, and sanctify your hearts, they will lead you down to be eternally subject thereunto&#x2014;subject to the power that will afflict and torment you, and eventually bring you to destruction; whereas, if you pursue the opposite course, those feelings and passions will become subject unto you; you will be enabled to govern and control them, and cause them to serve you, and subserve the object and design for which they were planted in your bosoms. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n617\"> Often have I looked at individuals passing to and fro through our Territory, and heard them say, &#x201C;These are the jolly Mormons; these are the merry Mormons, I never saw such a society!&#x201D; Why is this? Simply because they enjoy themselves, because they take so much comfort. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n618\"> Is a man a Saint, who comes into the Church of God under such influences, merely because the Saints appear to be happy? No, he is not. No person can be a Saint, unless he receives the Holy Gospel, for the purity, justice, holiness, and eternal duration of it.

Do you not know that the possession of your property is like a shadow, or the dew of the morning before the noonday sun, that you cannot have any assurance of its control for a single moment! It is the unseen hand of Providence that controls it. In short, what would you not sacrifice? The Saints sacrifice everything; but, strictly speaking, there is no sacrifice about it. If you give a <span class=\"italic\">penny<\/span> for a <span class=\"italic\">million of gold!<\/span> A <span class=\"italic\">handful of earth<\/span> for a <span class=\"italic\">planet!<\/span> A temporary worn out <span class=\"italic\">tenement<\/span> for one <span class=\"italic\">glorified<\/span>, that will exist, abide, and continue to increase throughout a never ending eternity, what a <span class=\"italic\">sacrifice to be sure!<\/span>  <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n620\"> Many, no doubt, would consider it a great sacrifice to be called to go on a mission a few years; to leave wife, children, friends, comfortable homes, travel perhaps on foot, encounter storms on the sea, be in perils on land among mobs,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124575\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124575)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124575)\">2 Cor. 11:26<\/a><\/span> and be hated of all men.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124576\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124576)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124576)\">Matt. 10:22<\/a><\/span> It is true we might consider this a great sacrifice, and yet men do all this, and more&#x2014;they risk their own lives upon their venture to get gold, to follow the allurements of pleasure.

Verily I say unto you, if you are not, and if you have a spirit to seek after the giddy, vain, foolish vanities of the world, the things pertaining only to the gratification of present feelings, passions, and selfish desires, and have no spirit of prayer and supplication, cannot and do not feel to exercise an interest above all others, for the cause of truth, my advice and counsel is for all such, to go straightway to the <span class=\"italic\">gold mines<\/span> of California, and seek for gold, for rest assured, as many as have this spirit, will run as their unrighteous feelings prompt or dictate. Yes! Go to the gold region, and do not come and seek my counsel about it, whether I am willing that you should go or not, for I am not only willing that you should leave, but anxious that you may as soon as possible. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n621\"> If you do not love God, and His cause, better than everything else besides, and cannot with a good heart and willing hand, build it up upon the earth; if you will not repent of your follies, and get the Spirit of truth in you, so as to love it, and feel willing to sacrifice all for it, you cannot build up the kingdom of God. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n622\">  <span class=\"italic\">Confidence<\/span>, brethren, <span class=\"small-caps\">Confidence<\/span> in our God, and in each other, is the text I gave the Twelve and all others who preached last sabbath, to preach from. The Twelve received missions to preach to the people in these valleys, in their various locations, last Conference; and I believe they have been tolerably faithful, under the direction of the President of their Quorum, brother Hyde. Let them now preach from this text, <span class=\"small-caps\">Confidence;<\/span> and let the entire people act upon its principles, and notice when and where it will begin and end, and see if we do not establish such confidence in this community, among this people, as never did, nor ever will exist upon <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"115b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD01\/JoD01_0115.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;115b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1796\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> the earth, in any community of people but Saints. I may say, that we have it already; but I think that an increase of faith in our God, and confidence in each other, is desirable. If we could obtain that faith and confidence in each other, and in our God, that when we ask a favor, we could do so with a full assurance and knowledge that we should receive, do you not perceive that it would lead us directly to do as we would be done<span class=\"citation\" id=\"124577\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124577)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124577)\">Matt. 7:12<\/a><\/span> by, in every transaction and circumstance of life. It would prompt us to do, not only as much as requested, but more.

This principle prompts us to do all we can to promote the interest of each other, the cause of God on the earth, and whatever the Lord desires us to do; makes us ready and willing to perform it at once. It needs the language of angels to express our ideas, to converse with each other in a manner to be perfectly understood. When we see and comprehend things in the Spirit, we ofttimes realize an utter inability to simplify and tell them in our language, to others; though we may receive principles, and convey the same to others, to some extent. It would be a great consolation to me, inasmuch as faith comes by hearing the word of<span class=\"citation\" id=\"72743\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 72743)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(72743)\">Rom. 10:17<\/a><\/span> God, if I had language to express my feelings.

He can see and understand in the Spirit only. He cannot tell it, yet many things may be given, in part, to others. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n623\"> I thought, while brother Rich was speaking upon certain principles, how beautiful, how satisfactory it would be to the Saints, could they converse in a pure language; if they could have the language of angels with which to communicate with each other.

I would simply say, we must attend to the duties which are laid upon us, before we enjoy our privileges. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n625\"> What principle does this convey to your minds? None, unless your minds are open, and enlightened by the visions of the Holy Spirit. The principles of truth are eternal. The mind would ask at once, what is truth? It is any thing, principle, or fact that actually has an existence. If a falsehood, yet it is true that falsehood exists. It is as true that devils exist, as that Gods exist. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n626\"> Jesus says, &#x201C;I am the <span class=\"italic\">way<\/span>, the <span class=\"italic\">truth<\/span>, and the <span class=\"italic\">life<\/span>.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"69918\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 69918)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(69918)\">John 14:6<\/a><\/span> The devil also says, &#x201C;I am, I exist;&#x201D; and consequently, by the same rule, &#x201C;<span class=\"italic\">I am Truth<\/span>.&#x201D; How far short is this of what the Lord reveals by His Holy Spirit! Jesus Christ, his Father before him, all the faithful, the Gods of eternity, and all organized elements, have been organized for the express purpose of being exalted to an eternal increase; or suppose I say to eternal truth. Would this convey to your minds that the devil, because it is a truth that he exists, could attain to the same power and exaltation? Suppose that we admit the idea that we shall see the time when we can combine and organize elements, bring worlds into existence, redeem, and bring them up to eternal glory, by merely saying&#x2014;&#x201C;<span class=\"italic\">I am Truth<\/span>.&#x201D; As before quoted, &#x201C;Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"69919\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 69919)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(69919)\">John 14:6<\/a><\/span> We can turn round and say&#x2014;Satan is the way, the truth, and the death; or the way, and the falsehood. Can you perceive the difference? But to say that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life, is equivalent to saying that he is the only continued or eternal existence. The Lord Jesus Christ works upon a plan of eternal increase of wisdom, intelligence, honor, excel<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"116b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD01\/JoD01_0116.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;116b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1795\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>lence, power, glory, might, and dominion, and the attributes that fill eternity. What principle does the devil work upon? It is to destroy, dissolve, decompose, and tear in pieces. The principle of separation, or disorganization, is as much an eternal principle, as much a truth, as that of organization. Both always did and will exist. Can I point out to you the difference in these principles, and show clearly and satisfactorily the benefit, the propriety, and necessity of acting upon one, anymore than the other? I will try in my own way, as briefly as I can. It is plain to me, but can you understand it? <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n627\"> In the first place, matter is eternal. The principle of annihilation, of striking out of existence anything that has existed, or had a being, so as to leave an empty space which that thing occupied, is false, there is no such principle in all the <span class=\"italic\">eternities<\/span>. What does exist? Matter is eternal. We grow our wheat, our fruit, and our animals. There they are organized, they increase and grow; but, after awhile, they decay, dissolve, become disorganized, and return to their mother earth. No matter by what process, these are the revolutions which they undergo; but the elements of the particles of which they were composed, still do, always have, and always will exist, and through this principle of change, we have an eternal increase. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n628\"> But Satan works upon the opposite principle; he seeks to destroy, would annihilate if he could, but only decomposes, disorganizes. Permit me to inquire what was his curse? It was, that he should not increase anymore, but come to an end. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n629\"> When I came to the door of the tabernacle, this morning, I heard brother Rich telling about one-third part of the heavenly host revolting from the government of Jehovah.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"79532\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 79532)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(79532)\">Rev. 12:4<\/a><\/span> This was their curse&#x2014;to never have tabernacles to dwell in. They now exist  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"117a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD01\/JoD01_0117.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;117a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1794\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>in Spirit, but shall never have a body, nor be exalted; they shall have no further addition to their existence; whilst those who did not rebel, could have tabernacles, and, through the resurrection, become personages of tabernacle in the eternal world. There it is, on the one hand, and on the other. You can now see the benefit, the propriety of obeying the principles which lead to eternal lives, exaltations, and increase; and why it is that Jesus Christ has so much more power than Satan. The power of the <span class=\"italic\">evil one<\/span> is beyond the conception of man; his cunning craft, and winning ways to insinuate and introduce himself into a community, an individual. This is to obtain, if possible, a tabernacle, which, although a borrowed one, yet increases his power, so long as he can wield it to suit his purposes; and if he fails in this, and in enticing unto evil, then, his object is to decompose, to destroy, that the good power, the good influence, may, like himself, become bereft of the power pertaining to an embodied spirit. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n631\"> The Lord operates upon the principles of continuing to organize, of adding to, gathering up, bringing forth, increasing and spreading abroad; while the opposite power does not. It shows the nature of his opposition to that peculiar trait of Christianity, based upon the principles of eternal duration, increase, power, glory, and exaltation; and points out the difference between the two adverse powers. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v1n632\"> Again, what do you love truth for?
