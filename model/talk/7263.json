The building where the institute meets was recently remodeled. I was told that as the workers removed the old pulpit from the chapel, they discovered some shelves that had been sealed off for some time. In removing the cover, they found a sacrament tray. It apparently dates back many years because the sacrament cups were made of glass. One of those glass cups, as you see here, was mounted and presented to me\u2014probably because I was the only one old enough to remember the days when glass cups were used.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p5\" class=\"\">Seeing the glass cup flooded my mind with pleasant memories. Glass sacrament cups were being used at the time I reached my 12th birthday, a very significant milestone in my life. My 12th birthday happened to fall on Sunday. For years I had watched the deacons pass the sacrament, anticipating the day that I would be blessed to receive the Aaronic Priesthood and have that privilege.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p6\" class=\"\">When that day finally arrived, I was asked to come to church early and meet with Brother Ambrose Call, second counselor in our ward bishopric. Brother Call invited me into a classroom and asked me to offer a prayer. He then opened the scriptures and read section 13 of the Doctrine and Covenants to me:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cUpon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"45104\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45104)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45104)\">D&amp;C 13:1<\/a><\/span>.]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p8\" class=\"\">Brother Call then asked me to comment on this section. My explanation was surely not complete enough, so Brother Call took some time to explain to me what it meant to be a bearer of the holy priesthood. Being worthy to hold the priesthood entitled me to use the power God delegates to man. One who worthily holds the priesthood can legitimately perform the ordinances God has prescribed for the salvation of the human family. This authority comes directly from the Savior Himself through a continuing line of priesthood holders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p9\" class=\"\">My interview with Brother Call must have been somewhat satisfactory, for I was taken into the deacons quorum meeting. There, the members of the bishopric laid their hands upon my head, and the bishop, who happened at the time to be my father, conferred upon me the Aaronic Priesthood and ordained me to the office of a deacon. I was also sustained by the other deacons to become a member with them in a quorum of the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p10\" class=\"\">In sacrament meeting that evening, I had my first opportunity to exercise the priesthood by passing the sacrament to the membership of our ward. The sacrament took on new meaning to me that day. As I watched the tray go up and down the rows of the members of the Church, I noticed that not everyone approached the sacrament with the same attitude. There were those who seemed to partake of the sacrament just as a matter of routine, but there were many, many who accepted the sacrament with great reverence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p11\" class=\"\">Over the years, I have participated, as all of us have, in many sacrament meetings, and to me they really are more than just another meeting. Partaking of the sacrament provides us with a sacred moment in a holy place. We do it in accordance with the commandment the Lord gave us in section 59 of the Doctrine and Covenants:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"45139\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45139)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45139)\">D&amp;C 59:9<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p13\" class=\"\">From the very beginning, before the world was organized, God laid out a plan whereby He would offer blessings to His children based on their obedience to His commandments. He understood, however, that we would be distracted at times by the things of the world and would need to be reminded regularly of our covenants and His promises.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p14\" class=\"\">One of the first commandments given to Adam was that he should worship the Lord and offer the firstlings of his flocks as an offering to Him. This ordinance was given to remind the people that Jesus Christ would come into the world and would ultimately offer Himself as a sacrifice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying: Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord?

It was discontinued with the Savior\u2019s atoning sacrifice. Then, the night before He completed that sacrifice, the Savior instituted the sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper to help us remember Him and the Atonement He made for all mankind. Thus, in the ancient law of sacrifice and in the sacrament, the Lord has helped us be certain that we do not forget His promises and the requirement that we follow Him and obey His will.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p19\" class=\"\">In the New Testament we have an account of the Lord administering the sacrament to His disciples.

Partaking of the sacrament worthily gives us an opportunity for spiritual growth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p40\" class=\"\">I remember that when I was a child, beautiful music was played during the passing of the sacrament. The Brethren soon asked us to stop that practice because our minds were centered on the music rather than on the atoning sacrifice of our Lord and Savior. During the administration of the sacrament, we set aside the world. It is a period of spiritual renewal as we recognize the deep spiritual significance of the ordinance offered to each of us personally. If we were to become casual in partaking of the sacrament, we would lose the opportunity for spiritual growth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p41\" class=\"\">Elder Melvin J.

We take upon ourselves the name of our Savior and promise to always remember Him and to keep His commandments\u2014that is, to \u201clive by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"45152\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45152)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45152)\">D&amp;C 84:44<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p44\" class=\"\">Parents, you have the responsibility of teaching your families the importance of attending sacrament meeting weekly. It should be a regular family practice. Every family needs that time of renewing and committing to live the gospel in accordance with the teachings of the Savior. Families, properly prepared, will attend sacrament meeting with a spirit of reverence and with gratitude for the opportunity of partaking of the sacred emblems.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p45\" class=\"\">I remember an experience our family had while on vacation at a resort area. Because the period of our stay included a Sunday, we made arrangements to attend a sacrament meeting at a nearby chapel. So did hundreds of others staying at the resort. The chapel was filled to overflowing. Before the meeting started, the bishop invited any attending deacons who were worthy and properly dressed to participate in the passing of the sacrament. An adequate number, dressed in white shirts and ties, came forward to receive instructions on how to handle such a large congregation. The ordinance was administered reverently and efficiently. As I observed the congregation, I saw that many were deeply moved by the spirit of the meeting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p46\" class=\"\">After we returned to the resort, there was an obvious difference in the Sabbath-day activities compared to that of the weekdays. Boats remained tied at the dock; the lake was almost free of swimmers; and the dress for the Sabbath day was very appropriate. Those families saw the fulfillment of the Lord\u2019s promise: by going to the house of prayer on His holy day and renewing their covenants to obey the commandments, they were able to keep themselves more fully unspotted from the world (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"45140\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45140)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45140)\">D&amp;C 59:9<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/as-now-we-take-the-sacrament.p47\" class=\"\">May there be instilled in each of us an increased reverence for the Sabbath. May we more fully realize the special blessing of being able to partake of the sacrament and its significance in our lives. May we always remember Him and keep His commandments, which He has given us to fulfill the purpose of life and the hope of the eternities that are to come. This is the Lord\u2019s work in which we are engaged. God lives. Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. We\u2019re permitted to be part of this great gospel plan, of which the sacrament is such a vital part.
