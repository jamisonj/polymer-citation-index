But we have differences, and those differences explain why we send missionaries to other Christians, why we build temples in addition to churches, and why our beliefs bring us such happiness and strength to deal with the challenges of life and death. I wish to speak about some of the important additions our doctrines make to the Christian faith. My subject is apostasy and restoration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p4\" class=\"\">Last year searchers discovered a Roman fort and city in the Sinai close to the Suez Canal. Though once a major city, its location had been covered by desert sands and its existence had been forgotten for hundreds of years (see \u201cRemains of Roman Fortress Emerge from Sinai Desert,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News,<\/span> 6 Oct. 1994, p. A20). Discoveries like this contradict the common assumption that knowledge increases with the passage of time. In fact, on some matters the general knowledge of mankind regresses as some important truths are distorted or ignored and eventually forgotten. For example, the American Indians were in many respects more successful at living in harmony with nature than our modern society. Similarly, modern artists and craftsmen have been unable to recapture some of the superior techniques and materials of the past, like the varnish on a Stradivarius violin.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p5\" class=\"\">We would be wiser if we could restore the knowledge of some important things that have been distorted, ignored, or forgotten. This also applies to religious knowledge. It explains the need for the gospel restoration we proclaim.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p6\" class=\"\">When Joseph Smith was asked to explain the major tenets of our faith, he wrote what we now call the Articles of Faith. The first article states, \u201cWe believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7053\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7053)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7053)\">A of F 1:1<\/a><\/span>] The Prophet later declared that \u201cthe simple and first principles of the gospel\u201d include knowing \u201cfor a certainty the character of God\u201d (\u201cConference Minutes,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Times and Seasons,<\/span> 15 Aug. 1844, p. 614). We must begin with the truth about God and our relationship to him. Everything else follows from that.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p7\" class=\"\">In common with the rest of Christianity, we believe in a Godhead of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. However, we testify that these three members of the Godhead are three separate and distinct beings. We also testify that God the Father is not just a spirit but is a glorified person with a tangible body, as is his resurrected Son, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p8\" class=\"\">When first communicated to mankind by prophets, the teachings we now have in the Bible were \u201cplain and pure, and most precious and easy\u201d to understand (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2102\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2102)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2102)\">1 Ne. 14:23<\/a><\/span>). Even in the transmitted and translated version we have today, the Bible language confirms that God the Father and his resurrected Son, Jesus Christ, are tangible, separate beings. To cite only two of many such teachings, the Bible declares that man was created in the image of God, and it describes three separate members of the Godhead manifested at the baptism of Jesus (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24107\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24107)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24107)\">Gen. 1:27<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"37586\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37586)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37586)\">Matt. 3:13\u201317<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p9\" class=\"\">In contrast, many Christians reject the idea of a tangible, personal God and a Godhead of three separate beings. They believe that God is a spirit and that the Godhead is only one God. In our view, these concepts are evidence of the falling away we call the Great Apostasy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p10\" class=\"\">We maintain that the concepts identified by such nonscriptural terms as \u201cthe incomprehensible mystery of God\u201d and \u201cthe mystery of the Holy Trinity\u201d are attributable to the ideas of Greek philosophy. These philosophical concepts transformed Christianity in the first few centuries following the deaths of the Apostles. For example, philosophers then maintained that physical matter was evil and that God was a spirit without feelings or passions. Persons of this persuasion, including learned men who became influential converts to Christianity, had a hard time accepting the simple teachings of early Christianity: an Only Begotten Son who said he was in the express image of his Father in Heaven and who taught his followers to be one as he and his Father were one, and a Messiah who died on a cross and later appeared to his followers as a resurrected being with flesh and bones.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p11\" class=\"\">The collision between the speculative world of Greek philosophy and the simple, literal faith and practice of the earliest Christians produced sharp contentions that threatened to widen political divisions in the fragmenting Roman empire. This led Emperor Constantine to convene the first churchwide council in <span class=\"small\">A.D.<\/span> 325. The action of this council of Nicaea remains the most important single event after the death of the Apostles in formulating the modern Christian concept of deity. The Nicene Creed erased the idea of the separate being of Father and Son by defining God the Son as being of \u201cone substance with the Father.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p12\" class=\"\">Other councils followed, and from their decisions and the writings of churchmen and philosophers there came a synthesis of Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine in which the orthodox Christians of that day lost the fulness of truth about the nature of God and the Godhead. The consequences persist in the various creeds of Christianity, which declare a Godhead of only one being and which describe that single being or God as \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and \u201cwithout body, parts, or passions.\u201d One of the distinguishing features of the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is its rejection of all of these postbiblical creeds (see Stephen E. Robinson, <span class=\"emphasis\">Are Mormons Christians?<\/span> Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1991; <span class=\"emphasis\">Encyclopedia of Mormonism,<\/span> ed. Daniel H. Ludlow, 4 vols., New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1992, s.v. \u201cApostasy,\u201d \u201cdoctrine,\u201d \u201cGod the Father,\u201d and \u201cGodhead\u201d).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p13\" class=\"\">In the process of what we call the Apostasy, the tangible, personal God described in the Old and New Testaments was replaced by the abstract, incomprehensible deity defined by compromise with the speculative principles of Greek philosophy. The received language of the Bible remained, but the so-called \u201chidden meanings\u201d of scriptural words were now explained in the vocabulary of a philosophy alien to their origins. In the language of that philosophy, God the Father ceased to be a Father in any but an allegorical sense. He ceased to exist as a comprehensible and compassionate being. And the separate identity of his Only Begotten Son was swallowed up in a philosophical abstraction that attempted to define a common substance and an incomprehensible relationship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p14\" class=\"\">These descriptions of a religious philosophy are surely undiplomatic, but I hasten to add that Latter-day Saints do not apply such criticism to the men and women who profess these beliefs. We believe that most religious leaders and followers are sincere believers who love God and understand and serve him to the best of their abilities. We are indebted to the men and women who kept the light of faith and learning alive through the centuries to the present day. We have only to contrast the lesser light that exists among peoples unfamiliar with the names of God and Jesus Christ to realize the great contribution made by Christian teachers through the ages. We honor them as servants of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p15\" class=\"\">Then came the First Vision. An unschooled boy, seeking knowledge from the ultimate source, saw two personages of indescribable brightness and glory and heard one of them say, while pointing to the other, \u201cThis is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30747\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30747)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30747)\">JS\u2014H 1:17<\/a><\/span>.) The divine teaching in that vision began the restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. God the Son told the boy prophet that all the \u201ccreeds\u201d of the churches of that day \u201cwere an abomination in his sight\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30749\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30749)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30749)\">JS\u2014H 1:19<\/a><\/span>). We affirm that this divine declaration was a condemnation of the creeds, not of the faithful seekers who believed in them. Joseph Smith\u2019s first vision showed that the prevailing concepts of the nature of God and the Godhead were untrue and could not lead their adherents to the destiny God desired for them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p16\" class=\"\">After a subsequent outpouring of modern scripture and revelation, this modern prophet declared, \u201cThe Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man\u2019s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"20432\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20432)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20432)\">D&amp;C 130:22<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p17\" class=\"\">This belief does not mean that we claim sufficient spiritual maturity to comprehend God. Nor do we equate our imperfect mortal bodies to his immortal, glorified being. But we can comprehend the fundamentals he has revealed about himself and the other members of the Godhead. And that knowledge is essential to our understanding of the purpose of mortal life and of our eternal destiny as resurrected beings after mortal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p18\" class=\"\">In the theology of the restored church of Jesus Christ, the purpose of mortal life is to prepare us to realize our destiny as sons and daughters of God\u2014to become like Him. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young both taught that \u201cno man \u2026 can know himself unless he knows God, and he can not know God unless he knows himself\u201d (in<span class=\"emphasis\"> Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 16:75; see also <span class=\"emphasis\">The Words of Joseph Smith,<\/span> ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook, Provo: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1980, p. 340). The Bible describes mortals as \u201cthe children of God\u201d and as \u201cheirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42986\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42986)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42986)\">Rom. 8:16\u201317<\/a><\/span>). It also declares that \u201cwe suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42987\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42987)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42987)\">Rom. 8:17<\/a><\/span>) and that \u201cwhen he shall appear, we shall be like him\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1166\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1166)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1166)\">1 Jn. 3:2<\/a><\/span>). We take these Bible teachings literally. We believe that the purpose of mortal life is to acquire a physical body and, through the atonement of Jesus Christ and by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, to qualify for the glorified, resurrected celestial state that is called exaltation or eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p19\" class=\"\">Like other Christians, we believe in a heaven or paradise and a hell following mortal life, but to us that two-part division of the righteous and the wicked is merely temporary, while the spirits of the dead await their resurrections and final judgments. The destinations that follow the final judgments are much more diverse. Our restored knowledge of the separateness of the three members of the Godhead provides a key to help us understand the diversities of resurrected glory.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/apostasy-and-restoration.p20\" class=\"\">In their final judgment, the children of God will be assigned to a kingdom of glory for which their obedience has qualified them. In his letters to the Corinthians, the Apostle Paul described these places.
