These standards are eternal, and they do not change. They have been taught by prophets of God. In a world filled with relative truth, the Lord\u2019s standards are absolute.

You must safeguard your power through purity of thought and action. By so doing, you, your family, and the generations that follow will be strengthened and blessed.

We reached a huge field of boulders and had to hoist each other and our packs to the top of each boulder. This was challenging, but by evening we reached the beautiful pristine lake.
