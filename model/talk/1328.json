We all enjoy their beautiful singing and acknowledge with\ngratitude the great contribution they make to our conferences.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of us assembled here today wish to welcome you who are listening in We send you\ngreetings and pray God's choicest blessings to attend you. In all humility and with a feeling\nof love I should like to address my remarks to you this morning. I should like to quote and\nenlarge on two or three of our Articles of Faith and explain what we believe and particularly\nwhat <i>sets us apart from the rest of the world<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>\nBefore doing so, however, I should like to refer briefly to that holy event, the greatest event\nin the history of mankind, the crucifixion and resurrection of our Savior Jesus Christ, who\nwillingly gave his life for you and me, and which event was commemorated last week in\nsong, prayer, and worship throughout the Christian world.\n<\/p><p>\nIt reminds us that \". . .

In fact, as stated in our Ninth Article of Faith: \"We believe\nall that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal\nmany great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6809\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6809)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6809)\">A of F 1:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is this belief more than any other that sets us apart from the rest of the world. Protestant\nchurches, as you all know, were formed at the beginning of, and during the period of, the\nReformation and resulted from the fact that many people were dissatisfied with the teachings\nand practices of the dominant church, which they claimed had transgressed the laws, changed\nthe ordinances, and broken the everlasting covenant, and therefore had apostatized.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Protestant churches, therefore, were established by men who were courageous enough to\ntake a stand and risk their lives, and some of them even gave their lives, in an endeavor to\ncorrect the malpractices with which you are all so well-acquainted.\n<\/p><p>\nI have not the time nor the inclination to go into any details about the malpractices or\nthe Reformation. I do say, however, that these Protestant churches were formed and organized\nby men who were dissatisfied with and protested against these malpractices. Though they\nwere good men with high ideals and the best of intent, they did not claim any divine\nrevelation or direct authority from God to organize their different sects. In fact, they claimed\nthat there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days: that all such things had\nceased with the Apostles, and that there would <i>never<\/i> be any more of them.\nOn the other hand, Joseph Smith the founder of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints, claimed that he was called by revelation and given divine authority direct from God\nand Jesus Christ and had received the keys of the priesthood under the hands of Peter,\nJames, and John.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Bible Reveals the Will of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThroughout the history of mankind, from Adam down to the present time, God has revealed\nhis will to his chosen prophets; for, as Amos the Prophet taught: \"Surely the Lord God will\ndo nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10427\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10427)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10427)\">Amos 3:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs we look back over the history of God's dealings with his people and read the revelations\nwhich he gave to his prophets to guide and direct them and prepare them for the future, we\ncannot help marveling at the continued interest he has shown in his people and the patience he\nhas shown and the care that he has taken to see that they were continually directed in the\npaths of truth and righteousness, if they would but listen to his holy prophet through whom he\nwas speaking.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we read the Old Testament we realize that he revealed his will to Adam, to Seth, to\nEnoch, to Noah, to Abraham, Jacob, Moses, and Isaiah, and all the prophets down to\nZechariah and Malachi, as they are recorded therein.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Bible testifies that revelation began with Adam and Eve, who heard the voice of the Lord\nGod while walking in the garden (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23699\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23699)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23699)\">Gen. 3:8<\/a><\/span>).\nGod revealed to Adam his origin, the purpose of\nmortality, his future destiny, and the requirements for exaltation. He also gave direction in\nsolving the special problems of his dispensation. Though the gospel plan has remained the\nsame from the beginning, important truths have been abandoned and forgotten, and therefore\nit has been necessary from time to time for God to raise up prophets to restore the gospel\ntruths, to testify to the people, and to instruct them in righteousness. Also, each dispensation\nfaced different problems, and therefore continuous revelation was necessary to cope with\nthem.\n<\/p><p>\nI have always been impressed with the way Moses was protected and preserved by the Lord,\nwho had chosen him and through direct revelation prepared and directed him day by day as to\nwhat he should do and how he should prepare to lead the children of Israel out of bondage\nand out of Egypt; how the Lord personally instructed Moses how to deal with Pharaoh and\nhow, through God's commands, plagues were imposed and withdrawn by the Lord; how the\nLord protected them as they crossed the Red Sea; and how he continued to lead and guide\nand direct them as long as they were prepared to listen to the prophet and follow his\ninstruction.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was Moses to whom the Lord, by direct revelation, gave the Ten Commandments as a set\nof rules by which the people should govern their lives. These remain today as much the word\nof the Lord as at any other time and apply equally to the people in these, the latter days. Yet,\nwhile he was receiving these commandments directly from the Lord, the people, whom he had\nled out of bondage and whom the Lord had taught through him, turned away from the true\nGod and began to worship idols.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Bible is replete in both the Old and New Testaments, with records of revelations given\nby God to his chosen prophets. God has always stood ready to lead and direct his people if\nthey would but listen to his word.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Book of Mormon<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs recorded in the Book of Mormon, Lehi was warned that Jerusalem would be destroyed,\nand he was advised to take his family and leave. As he listened to the voice of the Lord and\nfollowed his instructions, he and his family were led out of the city to safety and into the new\nworld, later to be known as America, while they who remained were destroyed or taken into\ncaptivity.\n<\/p><p>\nWhile the prophets in the old land were receiving revelations from God, the people of Lehi on\nthis, the American continent, were not left without guidance. Prophets were\nraised up through whom God spoke and directed his people in all their doings as they would\nlisten. He revealed to them also, 600 years before Christ's coming, that he would come, that\nhe was the Savior of the world, that he would be persecuted and crucified, and that he would\nbe resurrected.\n<\/p><p>\nThis was foretold clearly by Lehi, Nephi, Alma, and others, including\nSamuel, to whom it had been revealed the exact time that Jesus Christ would be born. They\nwere told of the signs which would be shown on this, the American continent, at the time of\nChrist's birth and crucifixion. Every word which had been revealed to them regarding these\nevents was fulfilled. Following his crucifixion Christ appeared personally to the people on\nthis, the American continent, and taught them the truths of the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nMany of the revelations recorded in the Old and New Testaments, as well as in the Book of\nMormon, refer most clearly to these, the latter days. Some of these are not generally\nunderstood by the world and can only be understood through revelations which were received\nin these the latter days, by the Prophet Joseph Smith. One example of these is that of John the\nRevelator who, when looking into the future, said:\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Another Angel<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach\nunto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,\n<\/p><p>\n\"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is\ncome: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of\nwaters\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42369\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42369)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42369)\">Rev. 14:6-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis revelation was fulfilled and clearly understood when the Angel Moroni did fly in the\nmidst of heaven and appeared to Joseph Smith and told him of the plates which contained the\ngospel in its fullness. Joseph said that as the Angel Moroni appeared to him, he called him by\nname (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30467\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30467)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30467)\">JS&mdash;H 1:33<\/a><\/span>) and\ntold him that \". . . there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an\naccount of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang.\nHe also said that the fullness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the\nSavior to the ancient inhabitants\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30468\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30468)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30468)\">JS&mdash;H 1:34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Gospel Restored<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThus we know that the angel, as predicted or prophesied by John the Revelator has flown,\nthat this great and glorious gospel has been restored in its fullness by the Lord through the\nProphet Joseph Smith to be preached to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.\n<\/p><p>\nAnother revelation recorded in the Old Testament which refers to these, the latter days, and\nhas reference to the Book of Mormon, is that received by Ezekiel wherein he says:\n<\/p><p>\n\"The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying,\n<\/p><p>\n\"Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the\nchildren of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the\nstick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:\n<\/p><p>\n\"And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23126\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23126)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23126)\">Ezek. 37:15-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs I read this, I went to the <i>Interpreter's Bible<\/i>, which is written in twelve volumes, and is a\ncommentary on all of the Old and New Testaments. This commentary was prepared by\nthirty-six consulting editors with over one hundred recognized, capable contributors, and deals\nwith all quotations from the Bible, taking them verse by verse and explaining their meaning\nand application. When I came to Ezekiel 37th chapter, verses 15 through 17, which I have\njust read, no feasible explanation was given, but conjectures only were made. This is no\nreflection on the editors or contributors to this great commentary, as they knew of no way to\nget the meaning.\n<\/p><p>\nHere again, by direct revelation and by direct revelation only, do we understand clearly what\nEzekiel meant. Here, the stick of Judah as referred to is the Bible, and the stick of Ephraim,\nwhich is written for Joseph and all the house of Israel his companions, is the\nBook of Mormon. Through the power of God and by direct revelation, this Book of Mormon,\nwhich contains the gospel in its fullness, was translated, and it with the Bible, became \"one in\nthine hand.\" How clear and simple the words of Ezekiel become if we will but listen to the\nprophet's voice!\n<\/p><p>\nThen again, Malachi records a revelation which refers to these, the latter days, wherein the\nLord said: \"For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea,\nand all that do wickedly, shall be stubble\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32782\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32782)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32782)\">Mal. 4:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then he said: \"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great\nand dreadful day of the Lord:\n<\/p><p>\n\"And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their\nfathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32786\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32786)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32786)\">Mal. 4:5-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAgain I went to the <i>Interpreter's Bible<\/i> to see what they had to say about this passage, and\nthough it had been in the Jewish scriptures for centuries, they did not understand it, and\ntherefore were unable to explain its meaning.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not mention this to belittle in any way this very complete and thought-provoking\ncommentary, but to point out that the full meaning and impact of this prophecy and promise\ncould in no wise be understood until Elijah himself actually appeared to Joseph Smith and\nOliver Cowdery in 1836.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Appearances of Divine Beings<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph records four revelations which he and Oliver Cowdery received in the Kirtland\nTemple. First the Lord Jesus Christ himself appeared and talked to them; then Moses, and\nthen Elias appeared and revealed certain things unto them. And then Joseph said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"After this vision had closed, another great and glorious vision burst upon us; for Elijah the\nprophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting death, stood before us, and said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth of Malachi&mdash;testifying\nthat he [Elijah] should be sent, before the great and dreadful day of the Lord come&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\n\"To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers, lest the\nwhole earth be smitten with a curse&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore, <i>the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands<\/i>; and by this ye may\nknow that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the doors\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14491\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14491)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14491)\">D&amp;C 110:13-16<\/a><\/span>,\nitalics added).\n<\/p><p>\nHow enlightening, encouraging, and consoling it is to be able to read this revelation and know\nthat Elijah has actually appeared.\n<\/p><p>\nThe prophecies contained in the three revelations to which I have referred and as recorded in\nthe Bible, wherein John the Revelator said, \"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of\nheaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42364\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42364)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42364)\">Rev. 14:6<\/a><\/span>),\nand Ezekiel, where it was revealed to him that the stick of Judah and the stick of\nEphraim should become \"one in thine hand\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23127\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23127)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23127)\">Ezek. 37:17<\/a><\/span>), and Malachi, wherein the Lord\nsaid, \"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful\nday of the Lord\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32785\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32785)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32785)\">Mal. 4:5<\/a><\/span>),\nhave all been fulfilled and point up clearly the need of direct\nrevelation in these, the latter days, for the guidance of the people, and that they might know\nthe will of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nWithout modern revelation the world would be left in complete darkness regarding first, the\nBook of Mormon, which is a new witness for Christ and contains the gospel in its fullness;\nsecond, the purpose and importance of temple work; third, vicarious work for the dead; and\nmany other things pertaining to the kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Testimony of the Restoration<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my testimony to you that God truly lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the\nworld, who gave his life for you and me; that the priesthood of God has been restored; that\nthe Church of Jesus Christ has been re-established in these the latter days with the same\norganization that existed in the Primitive Church, all by direct revelation;\nthat by direct revelation and the power of God we have the Book of Mormon which contains\nthe gospel in its fulness; that the heavens are as open today as they were in the days of\nMoses, Abraham, Peter, James, and John, and Paul; God still answers the prayers of the\nrighteous and still reveals his mind and will through his ordained prophets; that David O.\nMcKay is a prophet of God through whom the Lord speaks to his people today.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the very time that the young boy Joseph at the age of fourteen, went into the grove to ask\nGod which church he should join until today, he and those who have followed him as\npresidents of this Church have been led by revelation in all things pertaining to the kingdom\nof God.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we all hold fast to the iron rod, which is the word of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1596\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1596)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1596)\">1 Ne. 11:25<\/a><\/span>), and listen to the prophet's\nvoice and serve God and keep his commandments that he may continue to lead us in the paths\nof righteousness to immortality and eternal life, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
