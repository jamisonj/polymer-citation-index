After exchanging a few pleasantries, he, responding to my inquiry, told me about his business activities. He then inquired about mine. This, of course, led to a gospel discussion. He had no religion, although he said his mother was a Christian. He had no concept of a God, no idea whether he had had a pre-earth existence or whether he would live on after death. He had no purpose in life except to work hard and obtain a \u201creasonable standard of living.\u201d After discussing a few fundamental gospel truths, he responded: \u201cSuch concepts would surely give one an objective to live for.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-way-of-life.p7\" class=\"\">A few weeks later I mailed him a letter and sent him some literature.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-way-of-life.p8\" class=\"\">In his response, he wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-way-of-life.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cI still remember you, that I really enjoyed the conversation exchanged with you on the [airplane]. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-way-of-life.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cI have been working hard \u2026 without \u2018purpose.\u2019 \u2026 You made my eyes open for what is the true purpose of working every day and [of] life itself. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/the-way-of-life.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cIn the meantime,\u201d he said, \u201cI cannot stop drinking and smoking so far\u201d\u2014he was carrying a package of liquor when we were talking, and I let him read the Word of Wisdom.
