Wirthlin, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1942, pp. 36-37<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI sincerely trust, my brethren, that the same spirit that has guided and inspired those who have\nspoken to us during this conference may guide and direct me the moment or two that I stand\nbefore you.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been deeply impressed with the spirit of prophecy and revelation that has characterized\nthis conference. And why shouldn't there be a spirit of prophecy and revelation? For we\ndeclare to the world, \"We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and\nwe believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom\nof God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6599\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6599)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6599)\">A of F 1:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis declaration of faith is wholly consistent and compatible with the Lord's dealing with His\nchildren on the earth whenever the Priesthood has been bestowed upon men. Declared Amos\nof ancient times, \"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his\nservants the prophets\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10383\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10383)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10383)\">Amos 3:7<\/a><\/span>).\nThe writer of Proverbs declared, \"Where there is no\nvision, the people perish\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41377\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41377)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41377)\">Prov. 29:18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is needless to go into the annals of history to prove definitely that where there has been no\nvision, no revelation, and no prophecy, the people have indeed perished. In the days of Moses\nand Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Peter, and Paul, revelation was in the present tense. Consequently\ndoubters, disbelievers, critics, and those who stoned the prophets, were to be found in great\nnumbers, and time alone has proved the validity and the authenticity of the revelations of the\nMost High to His servants in all dispensations.\n<\/p><p>\nWe declare to the world that we do not only believe all that God has revealed but we believe\nthat He does now reveal His mind and will to those who are His chosen servants upon the\nearth today. And yet there are those who propound this question: What of present-day\nrevelations? Is God actually revealing His mind and will to those who guide and direct the\ndestiny of His Church? To such I would say that they are seekers of a sign, and as the writer\nof Proverbs says, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise\nwisdom and instruction\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41372\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41372)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41372)\">Prov. 1:7<\/a><\/span>).\nWe can point out many instances wherein the Lord is\nrevealing His mind and will to those who have been anointed to guide and direct the destiny\nof this great work.\n<\/p><p>\nSeven years have elapsed since the Presidency of the Church requested stakes, wards, and\nPriesthood quorums to set in motion the great Welfare Program. Well do I recall there were\nthose among us who doubted that such a plan was necessary and feasible. For, on one hand,\nthose in governmental positions advised and counseled the people to destroy food surpluses.\nFarmers were paid for crops that were not produced. And yet in the face of such counsel and\nadvice the leadership of the Church admonished us to produce greater abundances of foods\nand to erect storehouses wherein this food could be stored. There have since been erected\nmilk processing plants, grain elevators, and sewing centers which afford sufficient food, fuel,\nclothing, and shelter to care for every worthy member of the Church in case of an emergency. \nSeven years of plenty, of abundance, are about to come to an end, and we may face seven\nyears of leanness and the possibility of famine. The best authorities in the United States are\nnow indicating that a food shortage for the year 1943 is not a remote possibility due to\nseveral conditions, too many to enumerate at this time. In retrospect we can all go back in our\nminds and consider the counsel of the brethren with reference to this matter and observe\npresent-day conditions, which definitely prove that the Welfare Program was the mind and the\nwill of the Lord made known through the power of inspiration and modern-day revelation to\nHis people. With the passing of time, as was the case with the declarations given Moses on\nSinai for the children of Israel, the leadership of this people will be vindicated in all of their\nadmonishments to the people, and man will again be convinced that the Lord has and does\nreveal His mind and will to the prophets of modern times.\n<\/p><p>\nThe message of the First Presidency delivered to the people in April of this year and the\nmessage delivered this morning are revelations to the people, for they contain all of those\ngreat truths which are compatible with the mind and will of our Heavenly Father. I am\ngrateful to say that when instructions are given by the First Presidency of the Church and the\nQuorum of the Twelve, there comes to mind the revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith,\nwherein the Lord had this to say when His servants spoke to the people: \"And whatsoever\nthey shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of\nthe Lord shall be the voice of the Lord and the power of God unto salvation\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11755\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11755)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11755)\">D&amp;C 68:4<\/a><\/span>).\nThere is a test for modern-day revelation, the same test Jesus Christ invited those who\nheard His teachings to apply, for said He: \"My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If\nany man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, or whether I\nspeak of myself\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27079\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27079)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27079)\">John 7:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs leaders in Israel, brethren, we should accept wholeheartedly modern-day revelation as\npresented to the people by His chosen servants, applying it in our lives to the end that we\nshall be a shining example to all of those who come under our direction&mdash;admonishing the\npeople that they, too, can know of the doctrine, modern-day revelation, by following the\nadmonition of the Lord when He declared: \"Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall\nreceive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto you. Now, as you have asked, behold, I say\nunto you, keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion.\nSeek not for riches but for wisdom; and, behold, the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto\nyou, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11703\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11703)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11703)\">D&amp;C 11:5-7<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd eternal life can only be achieved, brethren, not alone by obeying the principles\nof the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, but by hearkening unto the advice and counsel of those\nwho are in authority that come to us as modern-day revelation.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless us, strengthen us, that we may ever be loyal and devoted to these servants of\nthe Lord, sustaining them in all that they request us to do, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
