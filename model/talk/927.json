I have in my pocket a perfectly good\nmanuscript which I feel impressed not to impose upon you today. There is something in my\nheart I should like to say in the few moments remaining in this meeting.\n<\/p><p>\nLike some of my Brethren who have referred to the recent passing of our three beloved\nassociates, I, too, miss them deeply. It may come as somewhat of a surprise to some when I\nsay that Brother Adam S. Bennion, who was older than he appeared, was my teacher. I am\nprobably younger than I appear, but Brother Bennion was one of the truly great teachers who\nhave touched my life.\n<\/p><p>\nFor a term at the Alpine summer school, of Brigham Young University, I was fortunate\nenough to sit at the feet of Adam S. Bennion in a course that I shall never forget&mdash;a course\nin biography.  I remember the term paper which he assigned to us.  It caused us to turn the\nsearchlight on our own lives. The subject was \"Why I Am What I Am.\" Under his stimulating\ndirection that group of students searched their souls for the influences that had come into their\nlives, the examples that had been set them, the temptations that had crossed their paths, and\nthe influences of the Church and of good men and women.  I still have that term paper; I am\ngrateful to Brother Bennion that he turned my thoughts inward and made me analyze my own\nlife and the influences which had affected the life of a young man up to that time. I am\ngrateful for the contribution which he made as one of the great teachers of the Church. My\nlife has been enriched. He helped inspire me to seek the good things which I enjoy.\n<\/p><p>\nI had the glorious privilege of traveling to stake conferences with Brother Thomas E. McKay. \nI think I never met a sweeter, more humble, and more beloved man. He was\ngood to be with. I loved him. My life has been enriched through my association with Thomas\nE. McKay.\n<\/p><p>\nAs an MIA worker I was stimulated and inspired as a boy, and later as a stake superintendent\nof the YMMIA by Brother Oscar A. Kirkham. He had the power to inspire youth and their\nleaders to noble achievement. I loved him as he loved the youth of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless the memory of these three noble souls whom we miss so much today. The world is\na better place to live because they lived in it. I hope to live worthy to meet them in the\neternal world.\n<\/p><p>\nMy brethren and sisters, I love the Church and all that pertains to it.  It has been my pleasure\nin the last few years to mingle with many people in and out of the Church.  I am very\ngrateful for the spirit of brotherhood and fellowship which we find in the Church. This spirit\nis a somewhat intangible thing.  It is difficult to describe. But it is real&mdash;powerful&mdash;sweet.\nYou have to feel it to appreciate it.\n<\/p><p>\nRecently with my wife, two daughters, and members of my staff, I made a world trade trip\nwhich took me into fourteen countries.  In most of these countries I was very proud and\nhappy to meet members of the Church. They were at the airports to welcome us and bid us\nfarewell as we departed. Several groups came to the embassies to see us.\n<\/p><p>\nIn far-off Japan it was a joy to join with some four hundred Japanese members of the Church\nin a Sunday morning service. We rejoiced to have the privilege to meet with our Mormon\nservicemen, some of whom had traveled a thousand miles to attend meetings on the Sabbath\nday. I will long remember the meeting with the Saints in Hong Kong, some of them refugees\nfrom Red China, and the spirit present as I met with local and full-time missionaries, and\nmingled with the Saints.  We met with groups of the Saints in Turkey, in Greece, in Spain, in\nFrance, in England.  Yes, even in the country of Jordan we met a family or two of the Saints\nin a Union Sunday School, a Christian Sunday School attended by many fine people of\nvarious faiths.  I had the glorious privilege of addressing the group, and I was very pleased to\nfind in the leadership of the Sunday School a member of the Church living the gospel,\npromoting the kingdom through example and through word of mouth.\n<\/p><p>\nI had many pleasant gospel conversations.  Good people&mdash;heads of states and other high\nofficials in India, Pakistan, Jordan, Israel, Italy, Portugal, and other countries showed sincere\ninterest in the Church and its people. Much Church literature has been mailed to new-found,\ngood friends around the world.  Their hospitality and friendliness will never be forgotten.\nAlthough we felt especially close to members of the Church, we were impressed with the fact\nthat people everywhere are essentially good. They long for peace. They love their families\nand seek to improve themselves and raise their standards of living. I came back with a greater\nlove for all of God's children&mdash;for he has truly \"made of one blood all nations\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7828\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7828)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7828)\">Acts 17:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo, my brothers and sisters, as I travel about the world, it is a glorious thing to note how the\nChurch is growing and increasing.  One very fine leader of a foreign state, when I asked him\nif there were any Mormons in his particular capital city, said: \"Mr. Secretary, I have traveled\na great deal, and I have come to believe that the Mormons are everywhere.  Wherever I go, I\nfind them.\" His statement called to mind an incident when we first moved to Washington,\nback in 1939 or 1940.  I had gone to my office early to get some work done before the\ntelephones started ringing.  I had just seated myself at the desk when the telephone rang.  The\nman at the other end said, \"I would like to have lunch with you today.  I am a stranger to\nyou, but I have something that is very urgent.\" I consented reluctantly, and a few hours later\nwe faced each other across a luncheon table at a downtown hotel.\n<\/p><p>\nHe said, \"I suppose you wonder why I have invited you here.\" Then he added: \"Last week as\nI came out of a luncheon meeting in Chicago, I told some of my business associates that I had\nbeen given the responsibility of coming down to Washington, D. C., to\nestablish an office and employ a man to represent our corporation.\" Then he listed some of\nthe assets in his great business organization.  He said, \"I began telling my associates of the\nkind of young man I would like to represent us in this office in Washington.  First of all, I\nsaid to my associates, I wanted a man of sterling character. You know, where there isn't\ncharacter there isn't much that is worthwhile. I would like a man who is honest, a man of\nreal integrity, a man who lives a clean life, who is clean morally, who, if married, is a\ndevoted husband, and who, if unmarried, is not chasing lewd women.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWell, of course it was not difficult to give him the names of three or four or a dozen who\nfully met the standards he outlined.  I mention this, my brethren and sisters and friends,\nbecause in the Church we have certain standards, standards of living, standards of morality,\nstandards of character which are coming to be well known to the world. These standards are\nadmired.  People with such standards are sought after. These standards are based upon true,\neternal principles.  They are eternal verities.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the Church we have no fear that any future discovery of new truths will ever be in conflict\nwith these standards&mdash;with any fundamental basics principle which we advocate in the\ngospel. Truth is always consistent. This fact gives to us, as members of the Church, a feeling\nof great security, a feeling of peace, a feeling of assurance. We know beyond any question\nthat the truths which we advocate, the truths of the gospel restored to the earth through the\nProphet Joseph, are in very deed the truths of heaven.  These truths will always be consistent\nwith the discovery of any new truths, whether discovered in the laboratory, through research\nof the scientist, or whether revealed from heaven through prophets of God.  Time is always\non the side of truth.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful for this assurance.  I am grateful for the knowledge which I have regarding the\npurpose of life, regarding the meaning of life, regarding the truths of the restored gospel.  At\nthis Easter season I would like to join my testimony to the testimonies of my Brethren which\nhave already been borne, and those that will be borne in the remaining sessions of this\nconference.\n<\/p><p>\nIn a world filled with doubt I am grateful for the knowledge which I have that God lives, that\nJesus is in very deed the Redeemer of the world, the Savior of mankind; that that beautiful\nstory which President Clark related here this morning is in very deed the account of the\ncrucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus the Christ, the Redeemer of mankind.  I am humbly\ngrateful for the knowledge that I have that God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, as\nglorified beings have again come to this earth in our day, in this dispensation; that they did in\nvery deed appear unto the boy prophet, the boy Joseph, in the Sacred Grove in 1820. This\nwas the most glorious manifestation of God the Father and the Son of which we have record.\nIt is, no doubt, the most glorious and most important event that has transpired in this world\nsince the resurrection of the Master. It is of world-wide significance.\n<\/p><p>\nI testify to you, my brethren and sisters and friends, that Joseph Smith was and is a Prophet\nof the Living God, an instrument in the hands of God in revealing to earth\nagain the truths of the everlasting gospel, in bringing back the priesthood, the authority to act\nin God's name.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful for the privilege of living in this day when the gospel is again upon the earth in\nits purity, in its fulness, and that we are permitted to enjoy the fruits of the gospel through\nmembership in the Church and kingdom of God.  This is the Church of Jesus Christ.  He\nstands at its head.  We serve him in striving to build up his kingdom, and in promoting the\ncause of truth throughout all the world.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us, my brethren and sisters, and hasten the day when the gospel will touch the lives\nand the hearts of all God's children in all lands, that they too may know of the sweets of the\ngospel, and the blessing of a testimony of the truth, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
