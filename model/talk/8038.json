We were looking for the records of my seventh great-grandfather. The head of Christ\u2019s College at Oxford, Dr. Poppelwell, was kind enough to have the college archivist bring the records. There in the year 1583 we found my ancestor\u2019s name, John Packer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-reason-for-our-hope.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">The following year we returned to Oxford to present a beautifully bound set of the standard works for the library at Christ\u2019s College. It seemed a bit awkward for Dr. Poppelwell. Perhaps he thought we were not really Christians. So he called for the college chaplain to receive the books.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-reason-for-our-hope.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">Before handing the scriptures to the chaplain, I opened the Topical Guide and showed him one subject: 18 pages, very fine print, single-spaced, listing references to the subject of \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d It is one of the most comprehensive compilations of scriptural references on the subject of the Savior that has ever been assembled in the history of the world\u2014a testimony from the Old and New Testaments, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-reason-for-our-hope.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">\u201cHowever you follow these references,\u201d I told him, \u201cside to side, up and down, book to book, subject after subject\u2014you will find that they are a consistent, harmonious witness to the divinity of the mission of the Lord Jesus Christ\u2014His birth, His life, His teachings, His Crucifixion, His Resurrection, and His Atonement.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-reason-for-our-hope.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">After I shared with the chaplain some of the teachings of the Savior, the atmosphere changed, and he gave us a tour of the facility, including a recent excavation revealing murals which dated to Roman days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-reason-for-our-hope.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">Among the references listed in the Topical Guide is this one from the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ: \u201cWe preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129858\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129858)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129858)\">2\u00a0Nephi 25:26<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-reason-for-our-hope.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">In His own words, the Savior has declared, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129859\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129859)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129859)\">John 14:6<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-reason-for-our-hope.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">And from the Book of Mormon, He declares: \u201cBehold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people.

Those who listen to and heed His words and the words of His chosen servants will find peace and understanding even in the midst of great heartache and sorrow. The result of His sacrifice is to free us from the effects of sin, that all may have guilt erased and feel hope.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-reason-for-our-hope.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">Had He not accomplished the Atonement, there would be no redemption.

A terrible wrong, which she did not identify but alluded to, had been committed against her. She admitted that she struggled with feelings of great bitterness. In her anger, she mentally cried out, \u201cSomeone must pay for this terrible wrong.\u201d In this extreme moment of sorrow and questioning, she wrote that there came into her heart an immediate reply: \u201cSomeone already has paid.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-reason-for-our-hope.p24\" class=\"\" id=\"p24\">If we are not aware of what the Savior\u2019s sacrifice can do for us, we may go through life carrying regrets that we have done something that was not right or offended someone. The guilt that accompanies mistakes can be washed away. If we seek to understand His Atonement, we will come to a deep reverence for the Lord Jesus Christ, His earthly ministry, and His divine mission as our Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/the-reason-for-our-hope.p25\" class=\"\" id=\"p25\">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was restored to move throughout the world the knowledge of the life and teachings of the Savior.
