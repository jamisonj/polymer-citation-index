They loved each other\nintensely. They had some knowledge of and faith in the principle of eternal marriage, but\ncarelessness in their pattern of living and bad habits precluded their conscientiously asking the\nbishop for a recommend to enter the sacred precincts of the temple.\n<\/p><p>\nTime passed. Children came. John was active in community life. His pleasing personality\nmade him many friends. Mary grew more lovely as the children came, and sweet motherhood\nand wifehood expanded her vision and enlarged her soul. The love she bore for her husband\ngrew constantly, and as their lives grew together, she came to realize how she wanted him\nforever. She came to sense her predicament. Shadows gathered. He was not religiously\ninclined, he said; some day he would move toward the temple.\n<\/p><p>\nShe took some part in church activity but when there came conflict between church service\nand his Sabbath interests, she felt that she should be with her husband&mdash;she loved him so\nvery much. The children grew and were happy in the Church until teenage activities brought\ncarefree, leisurely Sabbaths&mdash;rides, dates, skiing&mdash;and they also began to bypass their\nreligious duties.\n<\/p><p>\nOne day the clouds lowered, and trouble came. It was on one of those Sunday canyon picnics.\nAn excellent driver, John was not at fault for the crash when a drinking driver left both cars\njunk and two loved ones mangled and lifeless.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the bodies of his beloved Mary and sweet little Alice had been buried with all\nsolemnity and every tender affection, John found his life lonely indeed. The nights were so\nlong, the house so empty, the days so barren, life so vain and desolate. He devoted himself to\nhis work and to his other children, but his world seemed to have been buried in a hillside\ngrave.\n<\/p><p>\nAt the table the circle was incomplete. There were two vacant places. Social life had no\ninterest for him. No one knew how he suffered. No one knew how his heart ached. His\nthoughts were constantly of Mary, his companion, his beloved, the mother of his children.\nWhen he returned from his work, it seemed she should be there to slip into his arms; when he\nawakened in the morning, it seemed he could not get over expecting to find her by his side.\nHis first and last conscious thoughts were of Mary.\n<\/p><p>\nThen this night came the dream, or was it a dream, for he seemed to be so\nmuch awake. Unlike hundreds of his other dreams which had faded into oblivion with the\ncoming of the dawn, this impressive one lingered all the day.\n<\/p><p>\nIt seemed he was in a world where he had never been before. He was looking through a wide,\nheavy, open gate leading into a beautiful area in which the central figures were a woman and\na little girl. Gradually, he became conscious of their identity, and he felt a warm glow as he\nrecognized little Alice with her mother. Mary was more lovely than ever; her charm and\nbeauty had been accentuated. She was captivating, heavenly, and as both his loved ones\nsmiled and beckoned to him, he wanted, oh, how he wanted, to go to them. They seemed\nanxious that he join them. He tried to go to them, but he could not seem to move, and as he\nstruggled it appeared that the great gates were closing. Mary and Alice seemed conscious of\nthis also and beckoned frantically, but he was powerless to do that which at this moment he\nwanted so much to do. The movement of the gates was almost imperceptible, but the aperture\nwas definitely narrowing. He tried desperately but futilely to reach them. If he could but join\nthem! They, too, were eager for reunion. He caught a final glimpse and saw terror registered\non Mary's face as she, too, must have realized that the door was nearly closed. As the lock\nclicked, it was like thunder in his sensitive ears, and he felt he would give anything,\neverything, even life itself to see her again, to be with her again, to have her always with\nhim.\n<\/p><p>\nThe alarm clock clanged. He was back in the world. Ah! It was <i>only<\/i> a dream! <i>Or was it?<\/i> Had\nhe missed the mark? Had the great door really slammed shut? Had he lost his loved\ncompanion forever because he had failed to meet requirements?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd, we sadly recall the couplet, \". . . of all sad words of tongue or pen, The saddest are\nthese, 'It might have been!'\" (Whittier, <i>Maud Muller<\/i>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay I address my remarks to the numerous happily married couples who were united for the\nrelatively short period of time as stated by the bishop, \"so long as you both shall live,\" and to\nthose millions of well-adjusted couples in the world who were united by their ministers,\npriests, rabbis, or other prelates for the period stated \"until death do you part.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI plead with you peace-loving, sincere, but uninformed couples who love you companions and\nchildren, but who, in your vaunted false security, permit the days to pass, and the months and\nthe years without protecting your precious marriages against sure dissolution, when certain\nefforts and activities could preserve through eternity your warm and pleasant family\nrelationships.\n<\/p><p>\nA few of you know the requirements but have ignored or rejected them. The great majority of\nyou have never known the facts, so veiled in mystery they have been, and so long absent\nfrom the earth, and so little understood even by Bible students.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Man is Eternal: Marriage and Family Can Be<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThese are absolute facts:\n<\/p><p>\nLife is eternal. Death does not terminate the existence of man. He lives on and on. Man will\nbe resurrected whether good or evil. His spirit will be reunited with his body from the grave,\nand if he has perfected his life and magnified his God-given opportunities, that spirit and\nbody will be brought together in a new, fresh, never-ending immortality.\n<\/p><p>\nThe greatest joys of true married life can be continued. The most beautiful relationships of\nparents and children can be made permanent. The holy association of families can be\nnever-ending if husband and wife have been sealed in the holy bonds of eternal matrimony.\nTheir joys and progress will never end, but this will never fall into place of its own accord.\n<\/p><p>\nThe way is well-defined and clear. Eternal marriage was known to Adam and others of the\nprophets, but the knowledge was lost from the earth for many centuries. God has restored the\ntruths and has provided the way. With the restoration of the gospel came also the genuine\npriesthood, and God has given to his prophet all keys, powers, and\nauthorities held by Adam and Abraham and Moses and the early-day Apostles.\n<\/p><p>\nGod has restored the knowledge of temples and their purposes. On the earth this day are\nthirteen holy structures built to this special work of the Lord, and each is the \"House of the\nLord.\" In these temples, by duly constituted authority, are men who may seal for all eternity,\nhusbands and wives and their children. This is a fact even though unknown to the masses, and\nit is available as folks acquaint themselves with the need. This is one of the mysteries spoken\nof by the Redeemer, who taught the multitude in parables, saying:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from\nthe foundation of the world\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35365\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35365)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35365)\">Matt. 13:35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThese priceless truths are not understood by the casual reader of the scriptures:\n<\/p><p>\n\"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so\nthe things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"383\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 383)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(383)\">1 Cor. 2:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness\nunto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"386\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 386)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(386)\">1 Cor. 2:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is inconceivable that otherwise intelligent, astute, and highly educated people should ignore\nor wilfully disregard this great privilege. The doors can be unlocked. The gap can be bridged.\nAnd men can walk safely, securely to never-ending happiness, making their marriages\ntimeless and eternal.\n<\/p><p>\nExplaining the use of parables, the Savior said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it\nis not given\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35360\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35360)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35360)\">Matt. 13:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they\nhave closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears and\nshould understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35361\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35361)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35361)\">Matt. 13:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then speaking to those disciples who were near him and who understood, he said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those\nthings which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and\nhave not heard them\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35362\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35362)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35362)\">Matt. 13:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord knew that those who were sincere in heart and who really wished to know the\nmysteries of the kingdom would seek and search prayerfully until they informed themselves.\n<\/p><p>\nIt will be remembered how the Lord answered the hypocritical Sadducees who, trying to trap\nhim, propounded this difficult problem:\n<\/p><p>\nThe husband died leaving no posterity, and the wife married his brother who also died\nwithout seed. She in turn married a third brother, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth, and a seventh, all\nin accordance with the law of Moses, and then the woman of the seven husbands died also\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33175\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33175)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33175)\">Mark 12:18-22<\/a><\/span>).\nNow the frustrating question is:\n<\/p><p>\n\"In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the\nseven had her to wife\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33176\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33176)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33176)\">Mark 12:23<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Redeemer's answer was clear and concise and unmistakable:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33177\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33177)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33177)\">Mark 12:24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, we ask you, what does this mean? The Sadducees were discussing matters about\nwhich they knew little or nothing. Was there accusation in his voice? Was he saying to the\nSadducees, \"Open your blind eyes and see? Open your stony hearts and understand?\"\n<\/p><p>\nMy friends, do you understand the implications and truth of this statement of the Lord?\nThough somewhat veiled in scripture, it is clear and understandable when supported by\nmodern revelation.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>An Ancient Example<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nDr. James E. Talmage writes: \"The Lord's meaning was clear, that in the resurrected state\nthere can be no question among the seven brothers as to whose wife for eternity the woman\nshall be, since all except the first had married her for the duration of mortal life only . . . In\nthe resurrection, there will be no marrying nor giving in marriage; for all questions of marital\nstatus must be settled before that time, under the authority of the Holy Priesthood, which\nholds the power to seal in marriage for both time and eternity\" (<i>Jesus the Christ<\/i>, p. 548).\n<\/p><p>\nUndoubtedly, the first husband married the woman for eternity by a ceremony which was not\nlimited by time. She became a widow at his demise until she should also die and join her\nhusband. Now, she married brother number two, \"until death do you part,\" and it definitely\nparted them even before posterity and he went into the spirit world through the veil and with\nno wife, for their contract also had been terminated by death. And brothers number three and\nfour and five and six and finally number seven in turn&mdash;all married her in temporary\nmarriage, in which ceremonies were the limitations, \"so long as you both shall live.\" And\ndeath terminated what happiness they had had and their promise of future bliss.\n<\/p><p>\nHow sad! How gloomy!\n<\/p><p>\nI knew of one young couple whose promising marriage was ended by a car crash one hour\nafter the ceremony which included those perilous words, \"till death do you part.\"\n<\/p><p>\nCivil marriage is an earthly contract, completed in the death of either party. Eternal celestial\nmarriage is a sacred covenant between man and woman, consecrated in the holy temple by\nservants of God who hold authoritative keys. It bridges death; it includes both time and\neternity.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Paul's Testimony<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Apostle Paul told the Corinthians:\n<\/p><p>\n\"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"394\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 394)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(394)\">1 Cor. 15:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd we could paraphrase it to say:\n<\/p><p>\n\"If in this life only our marriages are firm, our marital bliss real, and our family life happy,\nwe are of all men most miserable.\"\n<\/p><p>\nPaul continues, \"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the\ncelestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.\n<\/p><p>\n\"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars:\nfor one star differeth from another star in glory.\n<\/p><p>\n\"So also is the resurrection of the dead\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"401\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 401)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(401)\">1 Cor. 15:40-42<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPaul understood, as undoubtedly did many of the Saints, but millions of Christians today do\nnot understand these vital truths which have been veiled in parabolic language. Heaven is not\na single place nor one single condition. It is as diverse as men's behavior patterns are\ndifferent, for men will be judged \"according to their deeds done in the flesh\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3049\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3049)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3049)\">2 Cor. 5:10 (JST)<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9040\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9040)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9040)\">Alma 5:15<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14413\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14413)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14413)\">D&amp;C 76 Headnote<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Modern Revelation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn our modern revelation, the Lord said: \"Therefore, prepare thy heart to receive and obey the\ninstructions which I am about to give unto you; for all those who have this law revealed unto\nthem must obey the same.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14510\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14510)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14510)\">D&amp;C 132:3-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThough relatively few people in this understand it, the new and everlasting covenant is the\nmarriage ordinance in the holy temple by the properly constituted leaders who hold the\ngenuine, authoritative keys. This glorious blessing is available to men and women on this\nearth. The deep underlying purpose is clarified by the Redeemer himself:\n<\/p><p>\n\"And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my\nglory; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and shall abide the law, or he shall be\ndamned, saith the Lord God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14512\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14512)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14512)\">D&amp;C 132:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPaul spoke of telestial, terrestrial, and celestial areas, and people are assigned in accordance\nwith their righteousness and their compliance with eternal laws. Even this\ncelestial kingdom has three heavens or degrees. We quote our Lord further:\n<\/p><p>\n\"And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood\n[meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];\n<\/p><p>\n\"And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.\n<\/p><p>\n\"He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14509\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14509)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14509)\">D&amp;C 131:2-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord then further clarifies the eternal marriage:\n<\/p><p>\n\"All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections,\nassociations, or expectations, that are not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit\nof promise, of him who is anointed, both as well for time and for all eternity, . . . are of no\nefficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are\nnot made unto this end have an end when men are dead\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14513\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14513)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14513)\">D&amp;C 132:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe marriages then which are made only \"so long as you both shall live\" or \"until death do\nyou part\" are sadly terminated when the last mortal breath is gasped.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord is merciful, but mercy cannot rob justice\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9046\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9046)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9046)\">Alma 42:25<\/a><\/span>).
