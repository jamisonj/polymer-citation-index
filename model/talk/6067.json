Perhaps you are not thinking much of that now. But the time isn\u2019t far away when you will think of it, and now is the time to prepare for that most important day of your lives when you take unto yourself a wife and companion equal with you before the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p12\" class=\"\">That obligation begins with absolute loyalty. As the old Church of England ceremony says, you will marry her \u201cfor richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, for better or for worse.\u201d She will be yours and yours alone, regardless of the circumstances of your lives. You will be hers and hers alone. There can be eyes for none other. There must be absolute loyalty, undeviating loyalty one to another. Hopefully you will marry her forever, in the house of the Lord, under the authority of the everlasting priesthood. Through all the days of your lives, you must be as true one to another as the polar star.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p13\" class=\"\">The girl you marry can expect you to come to the marriage altar absolutely clean.

You must not indulge in sleazy talk at school. You must not tell sultry jokes. You must not fool around with the Internet to find pornographic material. You must not dial a long-distance telephone number to listen to filth. You must not rent videos with pornography of any kind. This salacious stuff simply is not for you. Stay away from pornography as you would avoid a serious disease. It is as destructive. It can become habitual, and those who indulge in it get so they cannot leave it alone. It is addictive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p15\" class=\"\">It is a five-billion-dollar business for those who produce it.

It came to the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1833, when relatively little was known of dietary matters. Now the greater the scientific research, the more certain becomes the proof of Word of Wisdom principles. The evidence against tobacco is now overwhelming, yet we see a tremendous increase in its use by young men and women. The evidence against liquor is just as great.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p18\" class=\"\">To me it is an ironic thing that service stations offer beer sales. An individual can get as drunk on beer and be as dangerous on the road as he can on any other alcoholic substance. It is simply a matter of how much he drinks. How absolutely inconsistent it is for a service station, where you get gas so you can drive, to also sell beer that can cause you to drive \u201cunder the influence\u201d and become a terrible menace on the highway.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p19\" class=\"\">Stay away from it. It will do you no good. It could do you irreparable harm. Suppose you drink and drive and cause the death of someone. You will never get over it as long as you live. It will haunt you night and day.

They can absolutely destroy you. They will take away your powers of reason. They will enslave you in a vicious and terrible way. They will destroy your mind and your body. They will build within you such cravings that you will do anything to satisfy them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p21\" class=\"\">Would any girl in her right mind ever wish to marry a young man who has a drug habit, who is the slave of alcohol, who is addicted to pornography?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p22\" class=\"\">Avoid profanity. It is all around you in school. Young people seem to pride themselves on using filthy and obscene language as well as indulging in profanity, taking the name of our Lord in vain. It becomes a vicious habit which, if indulged in while you are young, will find expression throughout your life. Who would wish to be married to a man whose speech is laden with filth and profanity?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p23\" class=\"\">There is another serious thing to which many young men become addicted. This is anger. With the least provocation they explode into tantrums of uncontrolled rage. It is pitiful to see someone so weak. But even worse, they are prone to lose all sense of reason and do things which bring later regret.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p24\" class=\"\">We hear much these days of the phenomenon called road rage.

The more you do so while you are young, the more easily it will happen. Let no member of this Church ever lose control of himself in such an unnecessary and vicious manner. Let him bring to his marriage words of peace and composure.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p27\" class=\"\">I constantly deal with those cases of members of the Church who have been married in the temple and who later divorce and then apply for a cancellation of their temple sealing. When first married, they are full of great expectations, with a wonderful spirit of happiness. But the flower of love fades in an atmosphere of criticism and carping, of mean words and uncontrolled anger. Love flies out the window as contention enters. I repeat, my brethren, if any of you young men have trouble controlling your temper, I plead with you to begin the work of making that correction now. Otherwise you will bring only tears and sorrow into the homes which you will someday establish. Jacob, in the Book of Mormon, condemns his people for their wickedness in marriage. Says he: \u201cBehold, ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites, our brethren. Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children, because of your bad examples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up to God against you. And because of the strictness of the word of God, which cometh down against you, many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26010\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26010)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26010)\">Jacob 2:35<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p28\" class=\"\">Work for an education.

You do not need a big home with a big mortgage as you begin your lives together. You can and should avoid overwhelming debt. There is nothing that will cause greater tensions in marriage than grinding debt, which will make of you a slave to your creditors. You may have to borrow money to begin ownership of a home. But do not let it be so costly that it will preoccupy your thoughts day and night.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p33\" class=\"\">When I was married my wise father said to me, \u201cGet a modest home and pay off the mortgage so that if economic storms should come, your wife and children will have a roof over their heads.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p34\" class=\"\">The girl who marries you will not wish to be married to a tightwad.

She will wish to be married to someone who encourages her in her Church activity and in community activities which will help her to develop her talents and make a greater contribution to society. She will want to be married to someone who has a sense of service to others, who is disposed to contribute to the Church and to other good causes. She will wish to be married to someone who loves the Lord and seeks to do His will. It is well, therefore, that each of you young men plan to go on a mission, to give unselfishly to your Father in Heaven a tithe of your life, to go forth with a spirit of total unselfishness to preach the gospel of peace to the world wherever you may be sent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/living-worthy-of-the-girl-you-will-someday-marry.p36\" class=\"\">If you are a good missionary, you will return home with the desire to continue to serve the Lord, to keep His commandments, and to do His will.

There is so much of pain and sorrow that come of angry words. There is so much of tears that follow disloyalty.
