At the cemetery following a lovely funeral I attended, there stood near the open grave a small lad. His face was one of innocence, and his shining eyes showed the promise of a bright future.

He said, \u201cBrother Monson, you won\u2019t have to look for me, \u2018cause I\u2019ll be looking for you.\u201d Young men, some lessons in life are learned from your parents, while others you learn in school or in church. There are, however, certain moments when you know our Heavenly Father is doing the teaching and you are His student. Let me share with you tonight such a lesson, effectively taught and everlastingly learned. The lesson pertains to swimming but goes far beyond that skill.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p23\" class=\"\">I learned to swim in the swift-running currents of the Provo River in beautiful Provo Canyon. The \u201cold swimming hole\u201d was in a deep portion of the river, formed by a large rock which had fallen into the river, I assume, when the workmen constructing the railroad were blasting through the canyon. The pool was dangerous, what with its depth of sixteen feet, its current, which moved swiftly against the large rock, and the sucking action of the whirlpools below the rock. It was not a place for a novice or the inexperienced swimmer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p24\" class=\"\">One warm summer afternoon when I was about twelve or thirteen, I took a large, inflated inner tube from a tractor tire, slung it over my shoulder, and walked barefoot up the railroad track which followed the course of the river. I entered the water about a mile above the swimming hole, sat comfortably in the tube, and enjoyed a leisurely float down the river. The river held no fear for me, for I knew its secrets.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p25\" class=\"\">That day the Greek-speaking people in Utah held a reunion at Vivian Park in Provo Canyon, as they did every year. Native food, games, and dances were the order of the day. But some left the party to try swimming in the river. When they arrived at the swimming hole, it was deserted, for afternoon shadows were beginning to envelop it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p26\" class=\"\">As my inflated tube bobbed up and down, I was about to enter the swiftest portion of the river just at the head of the swimming hole when I heard frantic cries, \u201cSave her! Save her!\u201d A young lady swimmer, accustomed to the still waters of a gymnasium swimming pool, had fallen from the rock into the treacherous whirlpools. None of the party could swim to save her. Suddenly I appeared on the potentially tragic scene. I saw the top of her head disappearing under the water for the third time, there to descend to a watery grave. I stretched forth my hand, grasped her hair, and lifted her over the side of the tube and into my arms. At the pool\u2019s lower end, the water was slower as I paddled the tube, with my precious cargo, to her waiting relatives and friends. They threw their arms around the water-soaked girl and kissed her, crying, \u201cThank God! Thank God you are safe!\u201d Then they hugged and kissed me. I was embarrassed and quickly returned to the tube and continued my float down to the Vivian Park bridge. The water was frigid, but I was not cold, for I was filled with a warm feeling. I realized that I had participated in the saving of a life. Heavenly Father had heard the cries, \u201cSave her! Save her,\u201d and permitted me, a deacon, to float by at precisely the time I was needed. That day I learned that the sweetest feeling in mortality is to realize that God, our Heavenly Father, knows each one of us and generously permits us to see and to share His divine power to save.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p27\" class=\"\">Pray always in the performance of your priesthood responsibilities, and you will never be in the position of Alice in Wonderland. As Lewis Carroll tells us, Alice was following a path through a forest in Wonderland when it divided into two directions. Standing irresolute, she inquired of the Cheshire Cat, which had suddenly appeared in a nearby tree, which path she should take. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d asked the cat.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Alice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cThen,\u201d said the cat, \u201cit really doesn\u2019t matter, does it?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p30\" class=\"\">We who hold the priesthood know where it is we wish to go.

I am certain she anticipated a profound response which would contain the more familiar requirements for service of which we are all aware. However, I said, \u201cTeach your son how to cook, but more particularly, teach him how to get along with others. He will be happier and more productive if he learns these two vital skills.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p34\" class=\"\">Young men, you are preparing for your missions when you learn your duties as deacons, teachers, and priests and then perform those duties with determination and love, knowing you are on the Lord\u2019s errand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p35\" class=\"\">Sometimes the lessons will come quietly. A few weeks ago I was visiting a sacrament meeting at a care facility in Salt Lake City. The priests at the sacrament table were sitting quietly prior to performing their duties when the opening hymn was announced. A patient near the front of the large room had difficulty opening his hymnbook. Without so much as a question, one of the young men slipped to the patient\u2019s side and, gently turning the pages to the correct hymn, placed the disabled man\u2019s finger at the beginning of the first verse of the hymn. They exchanged an understanding smile, and the priest returned to his seat. This modest gesture of love and helpfulness impressed me. I congratulated him and said, \u201cYou are going to be an effective missionary.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p36\" class=\"\">Some missionaries are gifted with the power of expression, while others have a superior knowledge of the gospel. Some, however, are late bloomers who day by day become more proficient and successful. Avoid the temptation of ladder climbing in the mission leadership ranks. It matters little whether you are a district or zone leader or assistant to the president. The important thing is that each one does his very best in the work to which he has been called. Why, I had some missionaries who were so adept at training new missionaries that I couldn\u2019t spare them for other leadership assignments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p37\" class=\"\">Entering the mission field can sometimes be an overpowering and frightening experience. President Harold B. Lee was talking to me one day concerning those who feel inadequate and are worried when they receive an assignment in the Church. He counseled, \u201cRemember, whom the Lord calls, the Lord qualifies.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p38\" class=\"\">When I served as president of the Canadian Mission, headquartered in Toronto, one missionary came to our mission without some of the talents of others, yet he devotedly plunged into his missionary labors.

In making a selection of a missionary to prove the point, none of the bright-appearing, experienced, polished missionaries was selected, but rather, my new missionary, who had a hard time gaining knowledge of such things, was singled out. My heart literally sank. I looked at the pleading expression on the elder\u2019s face; I knew that he was paralyzed with fear. How I prayed\u2014oh, how I prayed: \u201cHeavenly Father, come to his rescue.\u201d And He did.

Turning to me he said, \u201cPresident Monson, I owe you and your missionaries an apology. They <span class=\"emphasis\">do<\/span> know the basic pamphlets and their authors.\u201d He stood tall in my sight that day, and we became close personal friends.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p52\" class=\"\">But what about the missionary?

You will recall that the prophet Samuel was directed by the Lord to go to Bethlehem, even to Jesse, with the revelation that a king would be found among the sons of Jesse. Samuel did as the Lord had commanded him. Each of Jesse\u2019s sons was introduced to Samuel\u2014even seven of them. Though they were fair and qualified in appearance, Samuel was told by the Lord that none was to be chosen. \u201cAnd Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him. \u2026 And he sent, and brought him in. \u2026 And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-95911_000_022\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2710\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2710)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2710)\">1 Sam. 16:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p54\" class=\"\">The lesson for us to learn is found in the sixteenth chapter of First Samuel, verse seven [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2709\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2709)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2709)\">1 Sam. 16:7<\/a><\/span>]: \u201cMan looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-95911_000_022\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"125082\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125082)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125082)\">1 Sam. 16:7<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p55\" class=\"\">As bearers of the priesthood, all of us united as one can qualify for the guiding influence of our Heavenly Father as we pursue our respective callings.

I have been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might have everlasting life.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-95911_000_022\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6361\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6361)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6361)\">3 Ne. 5:13<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/who-honors-god-god-honors.p56\" class=\"\">May we ever remember the truth, \u201cWho honors God, God honors.\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-95911_000_022\"><a name=\"-95911_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-95911_000_022\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cYe Who Are Called to Labor,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 321.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-95911_000_022\"><a name=\"-95911_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-95911_000_022\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32541\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32541)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32541)\">Luke 2:52<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-95911_000_022\"><a name=\"-95911_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-95911_000_022\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cChoose the Right,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 239.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-95911_000_022\"><a name=\"-95911_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-95911_000_022\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"2710\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2710)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2710)\">1 Sam. 16:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-95911_000_022\"><a name=\"-95911_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote5-95911_000_022\">5.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"125082\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125082)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125082)\">1 Sam. 16:7<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-95911_000_022\"><a name=\"-95911_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote6-95911_000_022\">6.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"6361\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6361)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6361)\">3 Ne. 5:13<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
