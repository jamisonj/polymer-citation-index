Many, if not most, of us carry keys in our pockets at this very moment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/keys-of-the-priesthood.p5\" class=\"\">But the keys about which I shall speak are far more important. They are precious, powerful, and invisible! Some can lock and unlock in heaven as well as on earth. I speak of keys of the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/keys-of-the-priesthood.p6\" class=\"\">You boys hold what is sometimes referred to as the preparatory priesthood. Preparation, priesthood service, and keys are all related, but different. Service of any type requires preparation. But proper authorization to give that service requires keys. May I illustrate?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/keys-of-the-priesthood.p7\" class=\"\">Prior to my call to the Twelve, I served as a medical doctor and surgeon. I had earned two doctor\u2019s degrees. I had been certified by two specialty boards. That long preparation had consumed many years, yet it carried no legal permission. Keys were required. They were held by authorities of the state government and the hospitals in which I desired to work. Once those holding proper authority exercised those keys by granting me a license and permission, then I could perform operations. In return, I was obligated to obey the law, to be loyal, and to understand and not abuse the power of a surgeon\u2019s knife. The important steps of preparation, permission, and obligation likewise pertain to other occupations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/keys-of-the-priesthood.p8\" class=\"\">Why is the power to act in the name of God more important? Because it is of eternal significance. We should understand the source of our authority and something of the keys that control its power. They may benefit every man, woman, and child who now lives, who has lived, and who yet will live upon the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/keys-of-the-priesthood.p9\" class=\"\">Let us consider keys of the priesthood through three scenes of history: in ancient days, during the Lord\u2019s mortal ministry, and in modern times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Scene One\u2014Ancient Days<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/keys-of-the-priesthood.p11\" class=\"\">Scene one pertains to keys of the priesthood in ancient days, even before creation of the earth.
