On the first day of practice his coach had him play one-on-one while the team observed. When he missed an easy shot, he became angry and stomped and whined. The coach walked over to him and said, \u201cYou pull a stunt like that again and you\u2019ll never play for my team\u201d (23). For the next three years he never lost control again.
