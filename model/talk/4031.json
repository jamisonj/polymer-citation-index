In the stress of the situation we declare, \u201cWhat have we done to deserve this? Why does the Lord allow this to happen to us?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-endure-it-well.p5\" class=\"\">With heavy hearts and broken spirits the parents of a wayward child were recently heard to say, \u201cWhere did we go wrong? What have we done to displease the Lord? What is the Lord trying to tell us? Is this the reward for trying to be good parents? Why us?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-endure-it-well.p6\" class=\"\">These were among a flood of questions that came as they agonized over the serious misconduct of their child.

Because the child had transgressed, they were adamant in their feelings that God was displeased with them. Their attitude reflected bitterness and loss of self-respect. Momentarily they were letting themselves be consumed and destroyed by the trying circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-endure-it-well.p8\" class=\"\">In their present tragedy they were not seeking counsel or comfort; rather, it appeared, they were looking for someone who would suffer with them and join in the chorus of \u201cIf there is a merciful God, why does He allow this to happen?\u201d We must remember that all suffering is not punishment. It is imperative that we do not allow ourselves to be destroyed by the conduct of others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-endure-it-well.p9\" class=\"\">Sometimes we spend so much time trying to determine what we did wrong in the past to deserve the unpleasant happenings of the moment that we fail to resolve the challenges of the present. Og Mandino wrote in his book <span class=\"emphasis\">The Greatest Miracle in the World,<\/span> \u201cIf we lock ourselves in a prison of failure and self-pity, we are the only jailers \u2026 we have the only key to our freedom.\u201d (New York: Frederick Fell Publishers, 1975, p. 61.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-endure-it-well.p10\" class=\"\">We can let ourselves out of such a prison by turning to the Lord for strength.

This scripture does not tell us how or when this commitment will be effective or realized, but His promise is real and binding. Our challenge is to endure.

She said to him, \u201cI can\u2019t think that far ahead. For right now I have to just take it one day at a time.\u201d This is what we must do when faced with trials and setbacks in our lives.

I will identify her as Diane because that is her real name. Diane was captain of the University of Utah\u2019s first national women\u2019s championship gymnastics team. In Miami, Florida, for the first-ever American professional tour, she over-rotated on a practice vault, landed on her neck, and damaged her spinal cord. Her slender, delicate body, which had endured hundreds of hours of demanding routines and the accompanying torturous training, was broken. The gal with the dazzling smile who was recognized as the heart of the team was now faced with the challenge of accepting sympathy as her reward or getting on with her life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-endure-it-well.p34\" class=\"\">Early in her gymnastics career when someone asked her, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of getting hurt?\u201d she replied, \u201cNo, you take the glory and you take the knocks. I\u2019ll just take whatever comes.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-endure-it-well.p35\" class=\"\">Diane\u2019s capacity to cope and get on with her life is best measured by her graduating from college two and one-half years after being paralyzed from the chest down. Wheelchair- bound, she seldom missed a class, was a good student, and was popular with classmates and instructors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-endure-it-well.p36\" class=\"\">Just a few weeks ago Diane wheeled herself into a third-grade classroom in a Salt Lake area elementary school, swallowed hard, and faced the curious students as their nervous teacher. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a teacher,\u201d she says with conviction. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d want to do more.\u201d \u201cHow about performing in the Olympics?\u201d she was asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she responds wistfully, \u201cI wanted that a lot, too.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-endure-it-well.p37\" class=\"\">How refreshing is her enduring attitude: \u201cI always got around fairly well on campus in my wheelchair alone, but when I came to steep hills I made friends in a hurry.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-endure-it-well.p38\" class=\"\">Diane has taken the knocks and the glory.

But life is not like that. No matter who you are, you will have problems. Tragedy and frustration are the unexpected intruders on life\u2019s plans. Someone has said, \u201cLife is what happens to you while you are making other plans.\u201d It is important that we not look upon our afflictions as a punishment from God. True, our own actions may cause some of our problems, but often there is no evident misconduct that has caused our trials. Just the normal journey through life teaches us that nothing worthwhile comes easy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-endure-it-well.p42\" class=\"\">Sometimes the most challenging form of endurance is found in trying to stay with our priorities, commitments, and assignments. How easy it is for some of us to lose our way when the unexpected, and seemingly undeserved, surface in our lives. Greatness is best measured by how well an individual responds to the happenings in life that appear to be totally unfair, unreasonable, and undeserved. Sometimes we are inclined to put up with a situation rather than endure. To endure is to bear up under, to stand firm against, to suffer without yielding, to continue to be, or to exhibit the state or power of lasting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-endure-it-well.p43\" class=\"\">Day by day we can make the effort to gain the power to last and to suffer without yielding.
