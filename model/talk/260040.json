This Gospel, which God has commanded us to offer to the world, is an order or system of things, simple, plain, and may easily be understood. In regard to its <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"369b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0369.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;369b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9159\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> principles, the nature of its requirements, and the precise kind and character of its blessings and promises, no one, however ignorant or unlearned, needs to be left in the dark; but may discover its golden truths, and the emblazoned mark of divinity in its arrangements as distinctly and as speedily as Naaman, the captain of the Assyrian host, found divine virtue and the hand of Divinity in the order prescribed to him by Elisha, through which his leprosy was removed. In his case, the order of obtaining a miraculous blessing, viz: to immerse seven times in Jordan, as prescribed by Elisha, was so simple, so plain, and in regard to its divine efficacy so easy of ascertainment, that the  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"370a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0370.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;370a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9158\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>great captain at first, was exceedingly wrathy at the idea that God should propose to work upon him through such easy and simple forms; but the order through which he could be healed of his leprosy was prescribed of God, through the Prophet, and finally the Assyrian officer, through the plain, commonsense reasoning of his servant, concluded to waive his objections and comply with the requirements; and having done so received the promised blessing.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"55789\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55789)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55789)\">2 Kgs. 5:1-19<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1261\"> The first principles of the Gospel which we offer, and which put men in possession of the revelations of God, and a knowledge of this work, are precisely as simple, plain, and as easy of understanding as the order before alluded to, through which the heavens were opened to Naaman. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1262\"> The Gospel was brought to our respective locations, far remote from these mountain vales. It found us citizens of various nations, speaking our respective languages, each possessing his peculiar notions and prejudices, with his associations, and a strong attachment to kindred, friends and country. However unpleasant, unkind, unjust, and inconsistent it might appear at first, we clearly foresaw that in receiving the Gospel we should be compelled to break off those associations, and sever those attachments, leaving the lands of our nativity, and go forth with our wives and our children to a distant land of which we had but little knowledge. Yet, a similar requisition was made upon the House of Israel, in the land of Egypt; also upon Noah and his family, and upon Abraham, and the family of Lot in the city of Sodom, and upon the families of Lehi and Ishmael, as mentioned in the Book of Mormon. <\/div> <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"370b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0370.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;370b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9158\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1263\"> But, in the provisions of the Gospel which was offered to us, there were fairness and safety; it proposed to give, through obedience to its requirements, a perfect knowledge of its divine authenticity; so that, in leaving our kindred, breaking up our social relations, and going forth from our native lands, we should first become perfectly assured that it was no human contrivance&#x2014;something gotten up to effect a political purpose or satisfy some worldly ambition, or to achieve some private end through human cunning or craftiness. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1264\"> The Gospel was plain and simple in its requirements, and there could be no mistaking the precise nature of its blessings and promises, nor the manner and time in which they were to be secured. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1265\"> The first feature, in this system, which struck us with surprise and arrested our attention, was its perfect similarity, in all its parts, with the Gospel as recorded in the New Testament. It required repentance, and a forsaking of sins, immersion in water for the remission of sins, with a promise that, through the laying on of hands by those having authority, people should receive the Holy Ghost, by which the knowledge would be obtained of the truth of the doctrine. Another remarkable feature, which called into exercise our most serious consideration, was the solemn testimony of the Elders, that they possessed the right to administer these sacred ordinances, by virtue of the Holy Priesthood committed to Joseph Smith, through the ministration of the Apostles, Peter, James and John.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"84677\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 84677)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(84677)\">D&amp;C 27:12<\/a><\/span> And furthermore, that this solemn and most important fact should be revealed to every man, upon his faithful obedience to the Gospel requirements. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1266\"> In these propositions, though at  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"371a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0371.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;371a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9157\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>first seemingly strange, we saw that everything was plain, fair and honorable. In doing what they required, we should only do, in fact, what, as true-hearted believers in the ancient Gospel, we ought to do; and if we failed to receive the promised blessing, and thereby proved the Elders' testimony false, our religious condition would, nevertheless, be <span class=\"italic\">then<\/span> as good as other Christians, and a little better, perhaps, because we should have approached a little nearer to the doctrine of the Scriptures, so far as their true forms and ceremonies were concerned. Of course, in this case, having proven to our satisfaction, that there was no Holy Ghost, no supernatural manifestations, no knowledge, no revelations accompanying the Elders' administrations of the Gospel; no human persuasion, no cunning sophistry could have induced us to leave our homes and friends to embark in a scheme which our common sense taught us would eventuate in bitter disappointment and inevitable ruin; but, like other Christians, we should have continued in the enjoyment of friends and home, still groping our way through religious darkness, expecting nothing, hoping nothing, and receiving nothing. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1268\"> But the fact that I am now speaking to assembled thousands of intelligent and enlightened people, who received this Gospel with the aforementioned fond considerations and lively expectations, gathered here by their own free will and choice, out of almost every nation, demonstrates most clearly, most forcibly and most solemnly, that this system of life, this Gospel as proclaimed by Joseph Smith, has been made known to us by the revelations of the Almighty&#x2014;that it is undeniably His will, His word and His message: not only this, but we <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"371b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0371.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;371b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9157\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> find within ourselves a fixed purpose, an unalterable resolution to do, if need be, what many of us have already done, viz: show the sincerity of our convictions of these solemn truths, through sacrificing all we possess&#x2014;not even holding ourselves so dear to us as this religion. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1269\"> There was yet another prominent feature embraced in this order of things, viz: where it found the people in poverty, misery, in a condition but a little above starvation; it spoke in positive terms of future relief, and effectual deliverance. It did not simply say: &#x201C;Be ye warmed, and be ye clothed,&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"94667\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 94667)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(94667)\">James 2:16<\/a><\/span> but it declared plainly, and in distinct terms, that the Lord had seen their bondage and oppression, and heard their cries of sorrow and affliction, and now had sent His Gospel for their deliverance, and would lead them into circumstances of independence. There, again, was something consistent, and worthy of admiration, and characteristic of our Great Parent, discoverable in all His dispensations, when in actual working order, as they were in the case of Noah, and in the calling of Israel, making them an independent people; likewise in calling Lehi to establish a people upon this continent, as well as in many other instances. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1270\"> A religious system is of but little account when it possesses no virtue nor power to better the condition of people, spiritually, intellectually, morally and physically. Enoch's order of the Gospel, did for his people all this, and it has done the same in every instance when preached in its purity, and obeyed in sincerity. Many thousands of the persons in these beautiful valleys, who formerly were compelled, with their wives and children, to subsist in a half-starved condition&#x2014;not owning a  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"372a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0372.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;372a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9156\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>habitation, or a foot of land, a horse, a cow, pig or chicken&#x2014;nothing they could call their own; subject at any moment, through the whim of their employer, to be turned into the streets, miserable beggars; now own cabinet shops, factories, mills, flocks and herds, beautiful gardens and orchards, and productive farms, wagons and carriages, dwelling in their own houses, in comfortable and easy circumstances. No one has any apprehension of starvation within the jurisdiction of the Latter-day Saints. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1272\"> The Gospel proposed these blessings at its announcement, and they have been most miraculously accomplished. No other religious system could have achieved such things, nor dared any other Christian denomination venture to send out its missionaries &#x201C;without purse or scrip,&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"68235\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 68235)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(68235)\">Luke 22:35<\/a><\/span> and without a college education, to declare to the people that they had authority from God to administer the sacred ordinances of the Gospel, through which should be revealed tangible evidence and knowledge of its divinity and of their authority to administer it; and to take people from a state of poverty, and lead them thousands of miles, and, despite every obstacle, establish them a comparatively independent people in the midst of a wild, desert country. Had they found them poor, friendless, without the means of living, and in servitude little better than Egyptian bondage, as we found many of them; they would have imparted no cheering news of an approaching salvation from the God of heaven; but could only have exhorted them to be contented and reconciled with their unhappy lot, and in no case must they look for any new revelation, or miraculous interposition. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1273\"> What philanthropists have wished <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"372b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0372.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;372b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9156\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> to accomplish, and often attempted, the Lord is now doing on a magnificent scale in this American Desert. Flourishing settlements, towns and cities have sprung into existence, extending over a distance of five hundred miles in length, and hundreds of miles in width, through the untiring energy and perseverance of a people, formerly totally ignorant of such labors. In these cities people live in harmony; and poorhouses, grog shops, gambling hells, houses of ill fame and prostitution are not known in any of our numerous towns and cities, except in some instances, where Christians (so-called), possess a footing and influence. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1274\"> No one, however prejudiced he may be, can scarcely avoid acknowledging the palpable fact, that this system has conferred miraculous blessings upon thousands and tens of thousands, in the way of putting them in possession of the means for sustaining themselves, after having delivered them from oppression and tyranny, little better than African slavery; and, no doubt, our legislators at Washington, one and all, would give us credit for our indefatigable and successful labors, in establishing an extensive and flourishing colony, on a portion of our Government domain, formerly inhabited by savages and wild beasts; provided we would admit this work to be the work of man, and not of God&#x2014;that it had been accomplished through the artifice and wisdom of man, and not by the power, wisdom and revelations of God. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1275\"> Joseph Smith, whom God chose to establish this work, was poor and uneducated, and belonged to no popular denomination of Christians.

Being honest ourselves, if we cannot bear a truthful testimony of having received divine manifestations that God, Himself, has founded this order of things, then it becomes a serious fact, that we are witnesses, and in truth the only proper witnesses, that this whole plan and pretention of Joseph Smith is a sheer falsehood, a miserable fabrication. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1279\"> It will be recollected that this Gospel message proposed to give us divine manifestations through our doing certain specified acts; we have performed those acts in precisely the manner indicated. None but ourselves have attempted to conform to this arrangement; consequently, no other people are prepared to be witnesses either for or against this system. * * * * * <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1280\"> When the Gospel, or order of things which we have received, was presented to us, we carefully compared it with the Gospel recorded in the Scriptures, and found it alike in every particular, as regards its forms, ordinances, and the authority to administer them; its promise of the Holy Ghost, and the signs that should follow, together with the promise of a knowledge of its divine origin. In many instances it was brought to us by men with whose character we were familiar, and for whose honesty and integrity we could vouch, who solemnly stated that, through an obedience to its requirements, they had obtained a knowledge of its heaven-born principles. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1281\"> This was my experience, and after having complied with its demands, and thereupon received a knowledge of its genuineness, and having obtained authority to preach  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"374a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0374.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;374a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9154\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>and administer its ordinances, I commenced forthwith to proclaim it to the world; and undoubtedly there are persons in this congregation, out of different nations, to whom I have administered this Gospel, who can witness to its virtue and efficacy. Many years I have been engaged in forwarding the interests of this order of things, and you are the proper judges whether it be of God or of man. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1283\"> We have the same Gospel the primitive churches had, and the like knowledge and evidence they had of its divine authority; and we have just as brave and honest Elders to preach it; men who have proven their integrity through sacrifice as great as the Elders of the primitive churches ever made. The testimony of our Elders is as valid and worthy of credit as the testimony of their Elders.

To obtain light&#x2014;a knowledge of the will of God, to secure the true religion&#x2014;divine manifestations regarding the truth of the doctrine as taught by Joseph Smith, was the first, and all-absorbing proposition presented to the people. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1290\"> Now, whether these Elders and missionaries were base impostors, promulgating sheer falsehoods, or not, is of course a question of grave consideration; yet it is a matter of far greater importance, and of more serious inquiry, whether our people, as a community, having failed to receive those divine testimonies, keep silent as to that most vital and important question, and come here to practice fraud and deception <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"375b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0375.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;375b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9153\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> in religion, and thus fasten irresistibly upon the minds of our children and future generations a system of falsehoods, for a divine religion. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1291\"> Joseph Smith affirmed that Peter, James and John visited him, and conferred on him authority to administer the holy ordinances of the Gospel<span class=\"citation\" id=\"84678\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 84678)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(84678)\">D&amp;C 27:12<\/a><\/span> through which every honest-hearted man and woman was promised the Holy Ghost, and a perfect knowledge of the doctrine. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1292\"> I had been a member of this Church but a short time when I obtained, by a divine manifestation, a clear, explicit and tangible demonstration of the truth of this work.

An important item which was prominently held forth wherever this Gospel was proclaimed, was, that its followers should have an abundance of persecutions, and probably, in the progress of this new life, be compelled to suffer the most trying sacrifices, as wife, children, houses and lands, despoiling of goods, and perhaps even, of life itself. No persons are properly prepared to enter upon this new life, until they have formed, within themselves, a fixed resolution to abide this ordeal. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1294\"> The Savior, the Apostles, Joseph Smith, and the Latter-day Elders, when offering this system to the people, told them clearly and em<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"376a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD26\/JoD26_0376.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;376a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/9152\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>phatically, that it required sacrifices of the most serious character&#x2014;that it would bring persecutions, change our warmest friends into bitter and relentless enemies, and that instances would occur when the world in the confused ideas of right and wrong, would even conceive they were doing God's service in taking our lives.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"70295\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 70295)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(70295)\">John 16:2<\/a><\/span> These were dark and forbidding prospects to a rational person in allowing himself to be proselyted to a system whose truths he could not know, but only guess at by what he was told, or of which he had read. Every man and every woman, before receiving a system that called for such sacrifices, would require a positive assurance that submission to its requirements would bring indisputable knowledge of its true divinity, so that, after having obtained a divine witness of its genuineness, they could willingly, cheerfully and with a resolution, inspired by the Almighty, move forward along the pathway of persecution and sacrifice, traversed in all ages by martyred Saints and Prophets. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1296\"> On this point permit me again to quote what Jesus promised, viz: &#x201C;Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And upon this <span class=\"italic\">rock<\/span> I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"64849\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 64849)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(64849)\">Matt. 16:17-18<\/a><\/span> Peter had obtained a <span class=\"italic\">revelation<\/span> which Jesus called a <span class=\"italic\">Rock<\/span>, which every man might receive individually for himself to build upon, with perfect assurance and safety&#x2014;on which he could anchor his hopes and prospects of salvation.

It is the people, the masses&#x2014;not exclusively their leaders, who possess this knowledge, and boldly testify to its possession. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1297\"> The astronomer may know of many laws and phenomena relating to the sun and its movements through ethereal space; but as regards the simple fact that it exists, and shines upon the earth, millions know as well as himself. President Brigham Young and even Joseph Smith, so far as respects the fact, that this Gospel which we preach as a divine institution, never professed to have a knowledge more convincing and satisfactory than tens of thousands in these valleys who never arose to address a public audience. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v26n1298\"> This system of religion, in its nature, in the character of its origin, the manner of its operations, and in the purposes for which it was designed, coupled with the fact, that people of honest hearts, can and will appreciate divine truth, is such that it cannot be destroyed. A man who is honest, full of integrity and love for the interest and happiness of mankind, having explored this long untrodden path, and made this glorious discovery, will not and cannot keep silent, but despite of threats and opposition, however fierce and terrific, will boldly declare the glorious fact, spreading and multiplying this divine intelligence, and if so required, seal this testimony with his own life's blood.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"92017\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 92017)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(92017)\">D&amp;C 135:3<\/a><\/span> <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
