President Hinckley extended this call to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve late Thursday afternoon. I cannot possibly articulate the kaleidoscope of feelings I have experienced since then. There have been sleepless nights and much prayer. My spirits have been buoyed, however, by the knowledge that President Hinckley is the prophet and that the membership of the Church will be praying for me and my family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p6\" class=\"\">To say that I feel deeply inadequate would be an understatement. When I was called as a General Authority in April of 1996, I also felt unequal to the calling. Elder Neal A. Maxwell reassured me then that the most important qualification for all of us serving in the kingdom is to be comfortable in bearing witness of the divinity of the Savior. A peace came over me at that time and has stayed with me since because I love the Savior and have had spiritual experiences that allow me to testify of Him. I rejoice in the opportunity to bear witness of Jesus Christ in all the world (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51512\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51512)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51512)\">D&amp;C 107:23<\/a><\/span>), notwithstanding my inadequacies.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p7\" class=\"\">In <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51486\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51486)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51486)\">Doctrine and Covenants 68, verses 5 and 6<\/a><\/span>, we read:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, this is the promise of the Lord unto you, O ye my servants.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p10\" class=\"\">I seek the companionship of the Holy Ghost as I speak with you this Sabbath morning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p11\" class=\"\">The overwhelming feeling that I have in receiving this call is that we must live by faith and not by fear.

My heart is full of appreciation for my family. My wife, Mary, has been the joy of my life. Her spiritual strength, righteous example, sense of humor, and loving support have blessed me throughout my life. Our three children and their spouses have been sources of great personal satisfaction and, together with our nine grandchildren, have been such a blessing to us.

How fortunate also to have had talented and devoted Church leaders, teachers, coaches, and friends who were wonderful examples to me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p16\" class=\"\">As a young man I had the opportunity to serve in the British Mission, which was a seminal, defining event in my life. The influence of a valiant mission president is one of the great miracles of the restored gospel. A few weeks ago, I received a birthday card at Church headquarters from a woman I helped teach in Gloucester, England, many years ago. I had lost contact with her. She informed me that she and her husband are both very active members and have 6 children and 20 grandchildren, all born in the covenant. It may be the best birthday card I have ever received.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p17\" class=\"\">Mary and I left Utah so I could attend law school in Palo Alto, California. We were planning to return to Utah after graduation, but the Spirit directed that we stay in California. We lived in California for 33 years and raised our family there. We both had many opportunities to serve. We loved the diversity of the members and their commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ. I will be eternally grateful for the wonderful Latter-day Saints in California who have been such a positive influence in my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p18\" class=\"\">These last 11 1\/2 years of service as a Seventy have been truly rewarding ones.

I\u2019ve tried to serve honorably and lighten their responsibilities in any way I could. I\u2019m grateful to the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve for their lives of goodness and example, their patience, their teaching, their kindness, their devotion to our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, and His restored gospel. I am grateful that God called Joseph Smith to be a prophet through whom the fulness of the gospel was restored to earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p20\" class=\"\">My experience as a General Authority has filled my heart with appreciation for the faith and goodness of the Latter-day Saints all over the world. We served for two years in the Philippines. In April of 1961, President Hinckley, then an Assistant to the Twelve, sent the first missionaries to Manila. There was only one Filipino priesthood holder in the Philippines. Today there are almost 600,000 members. Their lives are not easy, and they lack many material things, but they love the Savior. The gospel is having a tremendous impact in improving their lives. What a blessing to serve in their midst.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p21\" class=\"\">We also served for three years in the Pacific Islands. It is significant that almost 25 percent of all the Polynesians in the world are members of the Church. Their faith and spirituality are legendary. Sister Cook and I were in Vava\u2018u in the Tongan islands on one occasion. I had just spoken about following the prophet in the general session of stake conference. At the luncheon following the conference, I sat next to a distinguished elderly patriarch. He indicated how grateful he was to hear what the prophet was teaching. He gave me the following account. Vava\u2018u, which is a relatively small island, usually has sufficient rain, but periodically there are severe droughts. The island has long inlets or bays, almost like sounds, which curl into the island below steep hills. When drought conditions left the village without water, there was only one way they could obtain fresh water and stay alive. Over the centuries they had found that fresh water traveled down through rock formations inside the mountains and came up in a few spots in the sea.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p22\" class=\"\">The Tongan men would set off in their small boats with a wise elder standing at one end of the boat looking for just the right spot. The strong young men in the boat stood ready with containers to dive deep into the seawater. When they reached the appropriate spot, the wise man would raise both arms to heaven. That was the signal. The strong young men would dive off the boat as deep as they could and fill the containers with fresh springwater. This old patriarch likened this lifesaving tradition to the living waters of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the wise man to God\u2019s prophet here on earth. He noted that the water was pure, fresh, and, in their drought condition, lifesaving. But it was not easy to find. It was not visible to the untrained eye. This patriarch wanted to know everything the prophet was teaching.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/live-by-faith-and-not-by-fear.p23\" class=\"\">We live in a precarious time. The world is in desperate need of the fresh springwater, which is the gospel of Jesus Christ. We should listen intently to the prophet as we make choices. My own informal records indicate that President Hinckley has continually emphasized faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. That has been followed by his emphasis on strengthening families and having family religious observance in the home. Over and over again he has told us that if we would live a principle, we would gain a testimony of the truthfulness of that principle, which would in turn increase our faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">I know that many of you are concerned about raising your children during these difficult times and increasing their faith.
