We were told that in our meeting Friday with the Regional Representatives of the Twelve. Brother Hinckley told us at our last conference to read the Book of Mormon, and he has had over a thousand letters back from Saints, advising that they have read it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p4\" class=\"\">The Savior of the world advised us to read the scriptures. He said: \u201cSearch the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29019\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29019)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29019)\">John 5:39<\/a><\/span>). Is there anything worth seeking more than eternal life?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p5\" class=\"\">As I read the scriptures\u2014and I have read the Book of Mormon during the past six months and most of the Bible\u2014I always find something therein that I did not remember was there when I read it before. And I would like to use as a sort of a text for what I say here today a verse that I took from the book of Nahum, chapter 2, in the Bible, which reads as follows: \u201cThe chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cThe chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41065\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41065)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41065)\">Nahum 2:3\u20134<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p7\" class=\"\">Could anybody have described an automobile better than that before there was such a thing as an automobile? Certainly they travel like the lightning, and they look like torches\u2014especially in the evening when the lights are on\u2014and they jostle against each other. If you want a demonstration of that, just go to one of the body repair shops and see how many of them come in all bruised!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p8\" class=\"\">The thing that I liked about that particular passage of scripture is that it describes the day of the Lord\u2019s preparation. We live in that day. Five hundred years ago this prophecy could not have come true, but today there is no other answer for that prophecy than an automobile. The importance of the prophecy is that it describes the day of his preparation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p9\" class=\"\">I like to think of the many passages of scripture that designate the time of his preparation. I quote you from the book of Malachi, where the Lord, speaking through Malachi, said that he would send his messenger to prepare the way for his coming. And he would come swiftly to his temple, and who could abide the day of his coming, because he would be as refiner\u2019s fire and fullers\u2019 soap (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32860\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32860)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32860)\">Mal. 3:1\u20132<\/a><\/span>). Now, obviously that had no reference to his first coming. He did not come swiftly to his temple at that time. He did not come cleansing and purifying as refiner\u2019s fire and fullers\u2019 soap. We are told that when he comes in the latter days, the wicked will cry out to the rocks, \u201cFall on us, and hide us from his presence\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"42509\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42509)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42509)\">Rev. 6:16<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p10\" class=\"\">When the Lord sends a messenger to prepare the way for his coming, that messenger can be none other than a prophet. When the Savior came in the meridian of time, John the Baptist was sent to prepare the way for his coming, and Jesus testified of him that there was no greater prophet in Israel (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32049\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32049)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32049)\">Luke 7:28<\/a><\/span>). And the prophet Amos tells us: \u201cSurely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10474\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10474)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10474)\">Amos 3:7<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p11\" class=\"\">Therefore, when the time of preparation comes, as I have read to you here today, the Lord could not prepare for his coming without a prophet. And the prophet of this dispensation was none other than the Prophet Joseph Smith. And what he has brought forth is a fulfillment of so many of the prophecies of holy scripture that cannot be found anywhere else in all this world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p12\" class=\"\">I like the statement of Peter of old, following the day of Pentecost, when he talked to those who had put to death the Christ. He said the heavens were to receive the Christ until \u201cthe times of restitution of all things \u2026 spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8244\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8244)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8244)\">Acts 3:20\u201321<\/a><\/span>). Search this world over and you cannot find a church that claims a restitution of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets except The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We believe Peter was a prophet; and if the world does, then they cannot look for the Savior\u2019s second coming until there is such a restitution of all things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p13\" class=\"\">There is not time to discuss that restitution today, but just think of the coming of the Father and the Son to teach the real personality of the Godhead; the coming of Moroni with the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated; the coming of John the Baptist (as Brother Monson testified this morning) with the Aaronic priesthood, the power to baptize by immersion for the remission of sins; the coming of Peter, James, and John who held the keys of the holy apostleship, with power to organize the church and kingdom of God in the earth for the last time, in fulfillment of the promise made by Daniel in his interpretation of King Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s dream.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p14\" class=\"\">The king had forgotten his dream, and he called all the soothsayers and the wise men and astrologers, and none of them could tell him his dream. He heard of the man Daniel and sent for him, and Daniel said: \u201cThere is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10763\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10763)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10763)\">Dan. 2:28<\/a><\/span>). Then Daniel told him about the rise and fall of the kingdoms of this world until the latter days, when the God of heaven would set up a kingdom that should never be destroyed or given to another people. But like a little stone cut out of the mountains without hands, it would roll forth until it should become as a great mountain and fill the whole earth (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"10770\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10770)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10770)\">Dan. 2:44\u201345<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p15\" class=\"\">The establishment of that kingdom was made possible in these latter days\u2014and he said in the latter days\u2014through the coming of Peter, James, and John with the holy apostleship and the power to organize the kingdom of God in the earth again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p16\" class=\"\">One of our missionaries in the South, while I was the mission president there, preached about that dream and the establishment of the Lord\u2019s latter-day kingdom. I stood at the door at the close of the meeting, and a man came up and introduced himself as a minister. He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to tell me you think that kingdom is the Mormon church, do you?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p17\" class=\"\">And I said, \u201cYes, sir.

You just read the seventh chapter of Daniel and you will see where Daniel saw \u2018one like the Son of man\u2019 coming in the clouds of heaven unto the Ancient of Days.

If you will read a little further, Daniel said something like this: The kingdom and the power and the dominion under the whole heavens shall be given unto the Saints of the Most High God, that they might possess the kingdom for ever (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"10774\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10774)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10774)\">Dan. 7:18, 27<\/a><\/span>).

That is one of the positive declarations in the holy scriptures of a complete apostasy from the church that Jesus established. But the angel did not leave it there. He then showed John another angel flying in the midst of heaven, \u201chaving the everlasting gospel [and that is the only gospel that can save men] to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42512\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42512)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42512)\">Rev. 14:6<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1980\/05\/the-scriptures-speak.p25\" class=\"\">If the everlasting gospel had been upon the earth, there would have been no need for John to see a restoration brought back by an angel.
