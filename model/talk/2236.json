Certainly the word <span class=\"emphasis\">friend <\/span>is misused if it is identified with a person who contributes to our delinquency, misery, and heartaches. When we make a man feel he is wanted, his whole attitude changes.

A friend is a person who will suggest and render the best for us regardless of the immediate consequences.
