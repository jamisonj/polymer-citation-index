After 40 years of hardship in the wilderness, they were ever so close to their new home, where they could be free to worship the true and living God. At Moses\u2019s death, Joshua was called by God to be the prophet who would complete this miraculous journey.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/be-of-a-good-courage.p8\" class=\"\">Joshua was an influential leader. The Bible Dictionary calls him \u201cthe highest type of the devout warrior\u201d and indicates that his name means \u201cGod is help\u201d (Bible Dictionary, <span class=\"scriptureRef\">\u201cJoshua\u201d<\/span>). His inspired leadership was greatly needed because there were still many rivers to cross and battles to win before all that the Lord had promised to the children of Israel could be realized and obtained.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/be-of-a-good-courage.p9\" class=\"\">The Lord knew the prophet Joshua and the children of Israel would need great courage during this time. In the first chapter of the book of Joshua, the Lord tells him several times to \u201cbe strong and of a good courage.\u201d The word <span class=\"emphasis\">courage<\/span> is defined as \u201cmental or moral strength to \u2026 <span class=\"emphasis\">persevere,<\/span> and withstand danger, fear, or difficulty\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary,<\/span> 11th ed. [2003], \u201ccourage\u201d; emphasis added). Through their courage and obedience, Joshua and the children of Israel were able to enter the land of promise and find happiness in the blessings of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/be-of-a-good-courage.p10\" class=\"\">Joshua and the children of Israel lived long, long ago. But in our day we too are striving to enter a \u201cland of promise.\u201d Our greatest goal is to obtain eternal life with our Heavenly Father. In the first chapter of the book of Joshua, we find four sure guides to help us overcome our obstacles, complete our journey, and enjoy the blessings of the Lord in our \u201cland of promise.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/be-of-a-good-courage.p11\" class=\"\">First, in <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120128\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120128)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120128)\">verse 5<\/a><\/span> the Lord promises Joshua, \u201cI will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.\u201d We can find courage and strength in this promise that the Lord will always be there for us and will never leave us alone. We are taught that Heavenly Father knows and loves each of His children. As one of His precious daughters, you have access to His assurance and guidance through the power of prayer. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read, \u201cBe thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy prayers\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120545\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120545)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120545)\">D&amp;C 112:10<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/be-of-a-good-courage.p12\" class=\"\">I believe these words and promise you that Heavenly Father does hear and answer our prayers.

As we wait, we may begin to believe that we have been forsaken or that our prayers were not heard or that possibly we are not worthy to have them answered. This is not true. I love King David\u2019s comforting words: \u201cI waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120167\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120167)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120167)\">Psalm 40:1<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/be-of-a-good-courage.p13\" class=\"\">No matter what you may face in your personal journey, the first guide found in Joshua reminds us to pray, be patient, and remember God\u2019s promise: \u201cI will not fail thee, nor forsake thee\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120129\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120129)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120129)\">Joshua 1:5<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/be-of-a-good-courage.p14\" class=\"\">The second guide is found in <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120131\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120131)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120131)\">verse 7<\/a><\/span>, when the Lord tells Joshua, \u201cObserve to do according to all the law\u00a0\u2026\u00a0: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.\u201d The Lord is instructing Joshua to be strictly obedient to the commandments and not to deviate from the Lord\u2019s path. President Howard\u00a0W. Hunter taught: \u201cJoshua knew that his obedience would bring success, and although he did not know exactly how he would succeed, he now had confidence in the result. \u2026 Surely the experiences of the great prophets [found in the scriptures] have been recorded [and preserved] to help us understand the importance of choosing the path of strict obedience\u201d (\u201cCommitment to God,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1982, 57, 58).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/be-of-a-good-courage.p15\" class=\"\">A month ago I visited a group of young women.

Daily scripture study\u2014especially reading the Book of Mormon\u2014establishes a firm foundation for your developing testimony of Jesus Christ and His gospel. It invites the Spirit into your life. President Harold\u00a0B.
