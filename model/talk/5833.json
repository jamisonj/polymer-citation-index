Christ\u2019s life is the story of giving the Atonement. The life of Adam and Eve is the story of receiving the Atonement, which empowered them to overcome their separation from God and all opposition until they were eternally \u201cat one,\u201d with the Lord, and with each other.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/covenant-marriage.p7\" class=\"\">Without the Fall, Lehi taught, Adam and Eve would never have known opposition.

Covenant marriage requires a total leap of faith: they must keep their covenants without knowing what risks that may require of them.

The first wolf is natural adversity. After asking God for years to give them a first child, David and Fran had a baby with a serious heart defect. Following a three-week struggle, they buried their newborn son. Like Adam and Eve before them, they mourned together, brokenhearted, in faith before the Lord.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-96911_000_012\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"39942\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39942)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39942)\">Moses 5:27<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/covenant-marriage.p12\" class=\"\">Second, the wolf of their own imperfections will test them. One woman told me through her tears how her husband\u2019s constant criticism finally destroyed not only their marriage but her entire sense of self-worth. He first complained about her cooking and housecleaning, and then about how she used her time, how she talked, looked, and reasoned. Eventually she felt utterly inept and dysfunctional. My heart ached for her, and for him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/covenant-marriage.p13\" class=\"\">Contrast her with a young woman who had little self-confidence when she first married. Then her husband found so much to praise in her that she gradually began to believe she was a good person and that her opinions mattered. His belief in her rekindled her innate self-worth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/covenant-marriage.p14\" class=\"\">The third wolf is the excessive individualism that has spawned today\u2019s contractual attitudes. A seven-year-old girl came home from school crying, \u201cMom, don\u2019t I belong to you? Our teacher said today that nobody <span class=\"emphasis\">belongs<\/span> to anybody\u2014children don\u2019t belong to parents, husbands don\u2019t belong to wives. I am <span class=\"emphasis\">yours,<\/span> aren\u2019t I, Mom?\u201d Her mother held her close and whispered, \u201cOf course you\u2019re mine\u2014and I\u2019m yours, too.\u201d Surely marriage partners must respect one another\u2019s individual identity, and family members are neither slaves nor inanimate objects. But this teacher\u2019s fear, shared today by many, is that the bonds of kinship and marriage are not valuable ties that bind, but are, instead, sheer bondage. Ours is the age of the waning of belonging.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/covenant-marriage.p15\" class=\"\">The adversary has long cultivated this overemphasis on personal autonomy, and now he feverishly exploits it. Our deepest God-given instinct is to run to the arms of those who need us and sustain us. But he drives us away from each other today with wedges of distrust and suspicion. He exaggerates the need for having space, getting out, and being left alone. Some people believe him\u2014and then they wonder why they feel left alone. And despite admirable exceptions, children in America\u2019s growing number of single-parent families are clearly more at risk than children in two-parent families.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote9-96911_000_012\">9<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, \u201cDan Quayle Was Right,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Atlantic Monthly,<\/span> Apr. 1993, 47.]<\/span><\/sup> Further, the rates of divorce and births outside marriage are now so high that we may be witnessing \u201cthe collapse of marriage.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote10-96911_000_012\">10<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Maggie Gallagher, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Abolition of Marriage<\/span> (1996), 4\u20135.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/covenant-marriage.p16\" class=\"\">Many people even wonder these days what marriage is.

Society has a huge interest in the outcome and the offspring of every marriage. So the public nature of marriage distinguishes it from all other relationships.

He started for his bed, then turned around, raced back across the room, and hugged his mother, grinning with his fourth-grade teeth. Later I asked Marie in complete awe, \u201cHow did you do it?\u201d She said, \u201cI just made up my mind that I couldn\u2019t leave him, no matter what.\u201d Then she added, <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cI didn\u2019t know I had it in me.\u201d<\/span> She discovered deep, internal wellsprings of compassion because the bonds of her covenants gave her strength to lay down her life for her sheep, even an hour at a time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/covenant-marriage.p19\" class=\"\">Now I return to Tom and Tracy, who this year discovered wellsprings of their own.
