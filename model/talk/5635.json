Earlier this year she was struggling, and I didn\u2019t know how to help her. In my prayers I asked my Heavenly Father to bless her and to help me to be her friend. One day she became angry with me, and I did not understand. I didn\u2019t know how to react. I didn\u2019t want to say something wrong that might ruin our friendship, especially because this was a time when I felt she needed me. But after she became angry with me, I thought it would be too hard. I was considering giving up because I was discouraged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/trust-in-the-lord.p5\" class=\"\">One afternoon in seminary I came across a scripture in Mosiah that said: \u201cAnd now, if God, who has created you, on whom you are dependent for your lives and for all that ye have and are, doth grant unto you whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith, believing that ye shall receive, O then, how ye ought to impart of the substance that ye have one to another\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40928\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40928)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40928)\">Mosiah 4:21<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/trust-in-the-lord.p6\" class=\"\">I knew then that she needed and still needs of the <span class=\"emphasis\">substance I can impart:<\/span> my friendship and my testimony. I decided then that I would not give up on my friend. I talk to her every day, remember her in my prayers, and have faith that something positive will come from my efforts. I am so grateful that I prayed and received this guidance through the scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/trust-in-the-lord.p7\" class=\"\">As young women, we are faced with challenges, choices, and difficult situations. Many times we think we are strong enough to handle them by ourselves. We aren\u2019t strong enough, not by ourselves at least. But if we seek with real intent and with all of our heart for help and answers, we will receive guidance and direction from the Lord. We need to allow the Lord to help us. We must trust in him and do <span class=\"emphasis\">his will.<\/span> After we have done his will, we will find true joy and happiness.
