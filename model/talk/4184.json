The Lord needs you out in the mission field. Forget your fears. We don\u2019t expect you to do everything the young missionaries do. In fact, I was in Idaho trying to eliminate the fears of some high priests, and I said, \u201cYou retired couples don\u2019t have to memorize scriptures like the young missionaries, you don\u2019t have to memorize any presentations unless you want to.\u201d I told them, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get up early in the morning like the young missionaries do to study, and if it is raining or snowing, you don\u2019t have to go outside until you feel up to it. \u2026\u201d At that point a fellow down in the middle shot up his hand and said, \u201cWhen can I go?

Her legs were bothering her, and they got worse in the mission field instead of better. She wrote home, \u201cI thought we were just to work in the office, but now we find we are to proselyte also. But my knees are so bad we just can\u2019t go out looking for people, so we are praying very hard to find someone right here in our apartment building.\u201d In three months they had three baptisms\u2014new move-ins from their apartment building! Those missionaries were my parents.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p11\" class=\"\">Walter and Ernestine Walser were called to Peru. Former Bishop Walser was soon called as a branch president in the remote interior mountains. With his limited Missionary Training Center Spanish, Elder Walser had to choose counselors, hold meetings, teach, train, reactivate, ordain, and so on. In fasting and prayer he received impressions from the Spirit and went about his work. Elder Walser wrote, \u201cI learned that even with limited language, whenever it was needed, enough Spanish was given me to communicate, and I knew it was from the Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p12\" class=\"\">Like many adventures, there were hardships and sacrifices, but the Walsers said that the genuine love and affection of those wonderful Peruvian people and the feeling of being needed more than compensated. They are grateful for their spiritual adventure in serving the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p13\" class=\"\">Now you young unmarried sisters from twenty-one to sixty-nine with good health, there is no obligation to serve, but you are certainly welcome and wanted if the Spirit encourages you to volunteer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p14\" class=\"\">Let me tell you about two sister missionaries who called at a home one morning before the husband went to work. They were welcomed in, so they immediately told about Joseph Smith\u2019s first vision, the angel Moroni, the gold plates, and the restoration of the priesthood. Then the senior companion, noting that about forty-five minutes had gone by, said, \u201cWe would like to return next week to tell you more.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p15\" class=\"\">To which the husband exclaimed, \u201cNext week?\u201d He walked to the door, locked it, put the key in his pocket, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving here till you\u2019ve told us all you know about Joseph Smith and this restored gospel!\u201d They were there all day. The family asked for baptism that same evening.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p16\" class=\"\">Now you young men, unmarried, nineteen to twenty-six (eighteen outside the United States), healthy and worthy\u2014from the time of the recent prophets the spiritual adventure of a mission has been emphasized as a priesthood responsibility of such priority that again today we stress, <span class=\"emphasis\">your mission comes before marriage, education, professional opportunities, scholarships, sports, cars, or girls.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p17\" class=\"\">President Kimball said, \u201cShould <span class=\"emphasis\">every<\/span> young man fill a mission? The answer has been given by the Lord. It is <span class=\"emphasis\">yes. Every<\/span> young man should fill a mission.\u201d President Kimball then equated this instruction of going on a mission with the commandments of paying tithing, of observing the Sabbath, of marrying in the temple.

You will see people change; soften; become more humble, more obedient; have their prayers answered; and come to a knowledge that our message is true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p19\" class=\"\">Let me illustrate:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p20\" class=\"\">Two elders met and taught a professor with credentials from Heidelberg and the Sorbonne. His mind was not open to their message, but the man had to go to the hospital for surgery. While he was recuperating in the hospital, his yard and garden suffered. The two missionaries felt impressed to use their preparation day to mow his lawn, trim the hedge, and weed the flowers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p21\" class=\"\">The wife told her husband what they had done. He sent for the elders to come to the hospital, and with tears in his eyes he said, \u201cNever in my entire adult life has anyone ever gone out of his way to do anything for me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p22\" class=\"\">His demeanor changed. He listened to the missionary discussions. Previously skeptical, he now paid rapt attention and visibly became more meek and humble. He prayed for the first time since he was a child, and he received a testimony and was baptized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p23\" class=\"\">Two missionaries asked a new family to kneel in prayer, and the senior companion, not knowing why, asked the husband to move over by his wife and take her hand. He hesitated, and the missionary simply said, \u201cThat\u2019s what my mom and dad do at home. Please take your wife by the hand.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p24\" class=\"\">After they were baptized, the husband and wife tearfully confessed that they were on the verge of divorce when they met the missionaries. The husband had already moved out of the home. He was just there to visit the children when the missionaries appeared. The husband said that as his hand touched his wife\u2019s, a healing spirit came over them. Love replaced the wounds and the misunderstandings; they forgave each other, and the husband came home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p25\" class=\"\">Another man said that he would not go to church but that his family could go. The missionaries told him that they would always save him a seat right by the door in case he changed his mind. One Sunday he was prompted to go to church even though his family had left without him. From the foyer he could see his family seated with the missionaries and a space at the end of the pew vacant and easily accessible. He entered the little chapel, and his footsteps were heard. The missionaries turned their heads, and when they saw him, tears came to their eyes. After baptism the husband would say, \u201cNever in my life had anyone ever cried out of happiness just to see me enter a room.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p26\" class=\"\">A new senior companion faced a sophisticated woman lawyer who was polite but very intellectual. When the missionary asked her who the boy prophet saw in the column of light, she answered, \u201cI am an atheist.\u201d The elder didn\u2019t really understand the implication, so he repeated the question. She answered again, \u201cI am an atheist. You want me to say that Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son, but I do not believe in God.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p27\" class=\"\">The elder had never encountered an atheist before, and his first impulse was to give up and leave, but the Spirit said, \u201cNo, she will listen. Just answer the questions for her.\u201d So the elder proceeded and said, \u201cYou are right. He saw the Father and the Son.\u201d He continued with the presentation, but instead of asking questions directly, he asked them indirectly and answered them himself for her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p28\" class=\"\">At the end of the presentation he taught her how we pray, and then courageously asked her to kneel with them and to be the voice. She did kneel and did pray to her Heavenly Father. Never again did she say that she was an atheist. She and her family subsequently were baptized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p29\" class=\"\">In the mission field, more than anywhere else, you can enjoy those adventures of the spirit we call \u201cthin-veil experiences\u201d and \u201cliquid-fire experiences,\u201d the things so spiritual and miraculous that tongue cannot adequately confess nor the hand of man appropriately write.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p30\" class=\"\">The missionary has his own voyages of discovery into the realms of the Spirit, and he sees others uplifted with those heart-warming, peace-producing, mind-opening encounters of a spiritual kind which I choose to call \u201cadventures\u201d\u2014adventures of the Spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"preamble\">For example:<\/p>\n    <ul class=\"bullet\"><li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A verse of the scriptures that glows in your mind, like Joseph reading in James;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A prayer the Lord responds to with an outpouring of His love so intense that a yes or no answer doesn\u2019t really matter;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A hymn with poetic words of condensed spirituality that causes the soul to soar heavenward;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>An unselfish act of service which leaves you feeling as if you were serving perhaps even the Savior Himself;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The sacrament covenant to take Christ\u2019s name upon oneself pierces the soul so deeply that Christ\u2019s atonement truly becomes a personal, saving experience, a rebirth;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A newly placed Book of Mormon causing an inquisitive person to read half the night in an exciting discovery of the newfound witness for Christ;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The bad men who become good, the good men and women who become better, the great people who become greater and more Christlike through the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ul><p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p39\" class=\"\">Be instruments in His hands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p40\" class=\"\">Build up treasures in heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p41\" class=\"\">Discover the missionary adventures of the spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/11\/adventures-of-the-spirit.p42\" class=\"\">God lives and loves us.
