When I was older, I learned that the experience of Abraham and Isaac was what the scriptures call a <span class=\"emphasis\">type,<\/span> which is a likeness or reminder of something else. The Book of Mormon prophet Jacob said that the command for Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac was \u201ca similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25965\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25965)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25965)\">Jacob 4:5<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p17\" class=\"\">This story also shows the goodness of God in protecting Isaac and in providing a substitute so he would not have to die.

I thought, If I am ever surrounded by the forces of evil while I am in the Lord\u2019s service, I hope the Lord will open my eyes and give me faith to understand that when we are in the work of the Lord, those that are with us are always more powerful than those that oppose us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p43\" class=\"\">Bible stories such as these do not mean that the servants of God are delivered from all hardship or that they are always saved from death. Some believers lose their lives in persecutions, and some suffer great hardships as a result of their faith. But the protection promised to the faithful servants of God is a reality today as it was in Bible times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p44\" class=\"\">All over the world, faithful Latter-day Saints are protected from the powers of the evil one and his servants until they have finished their missions in mortality. For some the mortal mission is brief, as with some valiant young men who have lost their lives in missionary service. But for most of us the mortal journey is long, and we continue our course with the protection of guardian angels.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p45\" class=\"\">During my life I have had many experiences of being guided in what I should do and in being protected from injury and also from evil. The Lord\u2019s protecting care has shielded me from the evil acts of others and has also protected me from surrendering to my own worst impulses. I enjoyed that protection one warm summer night on the streets of Chicago. I have never shared this experience in public. I do so now because it is a persuasive illustration of my subject.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p46\" class=\"\">My wife, June, had attended a ward officers\u2019 meeting. When I came to drive her home, she was accompanied by a sister we would take home on our way. She lived in the nearby Woodlawn area, which was the territory of a gang called the Blackstone Rangers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p47\" class=\"\">I parked at the curb outside this sister\u2019s apartment house and accompanied her into the lobby and up the stairs to her door. June remained in the car on 61st Street. She locked all of the doors, and I left the keys in the ignition in case she needed to drive away. We had lived on the south side of Chicago for quite a few years and were accustomed to such precautions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p48\" class=\"\">Back in the lobby, and before stepping out into the street, I looked carefully in each direction. By the light of a nearby streetlight, I could see that the street was deserted except for three young men walking by. I waited until they were out of sight and then walked quickly toward our car.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p49\" class=\"\">As I came to the driver\u2019s side and paused for June to unlock the door, I saw one of these young men running back toward me. He had something in his right hand, and I knew what it would be. There was no time to get into the car and drive away before he came within range.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p50\" class=\"\">Fortunately, as June leaned across to open the door, she glanced through the back window and saw this fellow coming around the end of the car with a gun in his hand. Wisely, she did not unlock the door. For the next two or three minutes, which seemed like an eternity, she was a horrified spectator to an event happening at her eye level, just outside the driver\u2019s window.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p51\" class=\"\">The young man pushed the gun against my stomach and said, \u201cGive me your money.\u201d I took the wallet out of my pocket and showed him it was empty. I wasn\u2019t even wearing a watch I could offer him because my watchband had broken earlier that day. I offered him some coins I had in my pocket, but he growled a rejection.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p52\" class=\"\">\u201cGive me your car keys,\u201d he demanded. \u201cThey are in the car,\u201d I told him. \u201cTell her to open the car,\u201d he replied. For a moment I considered the new possibilities that would present, and then refused. He was furious. He jabbed me in the stomach with his gun and said, \u201cDo it, or I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p53\" class=\"\">Although this event happened twenty-two years ago, I remember it as clearly as if it were yesterday. I read somewhere that nothing concentrates the mind as wonderfully as having someone stand in front of you with a deadly weapon and tell you he intends to kill you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p54\" class=\"\">When I refused, the young robber repeated his demands, this time emphasizing them with an angrier tone and more motion with his gun. I remember thinking that he probably wouldn\u2019t shoot me on purpose, but if he wasn\u2019t careful in the way he kept jabbing that gun into my stomach, he might shoot me by mistake. His gun looked like a cheap one, and I was nervous about its firing mechanism.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p55\" class=\"\">\u201cGive me your money.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have any.\u201d \u201cGive me your car keys.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re in the car.\u201d \u201cTell her to open the car.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t do it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll kill you if you don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t do it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p56\" class=\"\">Inside the car June couldn\u2019t hear the conversation, but she could see the action with the gun. She agonized over what she should do. Should she unlock the door? Should she honk the horn? Should she drive away? Everything she considered seemed to have the possibility of making matters worse, so she just waited and prayed. Then a peaceful feeling came over her. She felt it would be all right.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p57\" class=\"\">Then, for the first time, I saw the possibility of help. From behind the robber, a city bus approached. It stopped about twenty feet away. A passenger stepped off and scurried away. The driver looked directly at me, but I could see that he was not going to offer any assistance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p58\" class=\"\">While this was happening behind the young robber, out of his view, he became nervous and distracted. His gun wavered from my stomach until its barrel pointed slightly to my left. My arm was already partly raised, and with a quick motion I could seize the gun and struggle with him without the likelihood of being shot. I was taller and heavier than this young man, and at that time of my life was somewhat athletic. I had no doubt that I could prevail in a quick wrestling match if I could get his gun out of the contest.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p59\" class=\"\">Just as I was about to make my move, I had a unique experience. I did not see anything or hear anything, but I <span class=\"emphasis\">knew<\/span> something. I knew what would happen if I grabbed that gun. We would struggle, and I would turn the gun into that young man\u2019s chest. It would fire, and he would die. I also understood that I must not have the blood of that young man on my conscience for the rest of my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p60\" class=\"\">I relaxed, and as the bus pulled away I followed an impulse to put my right hand on his shoulder and give him a lecture. June and I had some teenage children at that time, and giving lectures came naturally.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p61\" class=\"\">\u201cLook here,\u201d I said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right. What you\u2019re doing just isn\u2019t right. The next car might be a policeman, and you could get killed or sent to jail for this.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p62\" class=\"\">With the gun back in my stomach, the young robber replied to my lecture by going through his demands for the third time. But this time his voice was subdued. When he offered the final threat to kill me, he didn\u2019t sound persuasive. When I refused again, he hesitated for a moment and then stuck the gun in his pocket and ran away. June unlocked the door, and we drove off, uttering a prayer of thanks. We had experienced the kind of miraculous protection illustrated in the Bible stories I had read as a boy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p63\" class=\"\">I have often pondered the significance of that event in relation to the responsibilities that came later in my life. Less than a year after that August night, I was chosen as president of Brigham Young University. Almost fourteen years after that experience, I received my present calling.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1992\/11\/bible-stories-and-personal-protection.p64\" class=\"\">I am grateful that the Lord gave me the vision and strength to refrain from trusting in the arm of flesh and to put my trust in the protecting care of our Heavenly Father.
