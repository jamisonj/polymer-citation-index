McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1953, pp. 135-138<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nThe hour that marks the close of this great conference is here.\n<\/p><p>\nAs you know, four members of our General Authorities have been disabled recently, and are\nunable to carry on their regular duties. We are thankful to say, however, that two of them\nhave been with us during the sessions that mark the inspiration and uplift of this gathering.\n<\/p><p>\nElder Thomas E. McKay has been incapacitated for several months. He and the others have\nhad to pay the penalty of overwork, over exertion. When he collapsed several months ago, his\nheartbeats went down, according to the doctor, to sixteen. We are told that when they get\nbelow thirty life is precarious, but from that time, when Thomas E. called his family together\nto say good-bye, up to the present, he has shown gradual improvement and now he counts his\nheartbeats at thirty-six, thirty-eight, occasionally they reach forty. He acknowledges, and we\nacknowledge, the hand of the Lord in the preservation of his life, and we appreciate, and he\nappreciates your faith and prayers in his behalf.\n<\/p><p>\nElder Clifford E. Young recently met with an accident, but he, as you know, is sufficiently\nrestored to be enabled to take his part as one of the speakers in this conference, and has given\nyou his message, as has also Elder Thomas E. McKay.\n<\/p><p>\nElder Albert E. Bowen, also stricken, has been confined to the hospital for several months. It\nis said that one element of true greatness is to choose the right with invincible resolution.\nThat, our Brother Bowen has always done, and expounded the principles of the gospel with a\nclarity so characteristic of him. Our hearts ache as we note that some of his muscles are not\nresponding. However, we want him to know as we close this great conference, that he still has\nand will continue to have our faith and prayers for his restoration to health; and we pray that\nthe Lord will give him a desire, and increased faith, to receive the blessings which we hope\nthe Lord will give him. With all our hearts we say God bless you, Brother Bowen.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Richards, another great leader, has been putting forth too much effort also, and his\nphysical condition requires rest. I am pleased to report to you he is sufficiently recovered to\nmeet occasionally in meetings of the First Presidency. President Clark and I have had three\nmeetings with him during the three days that we have been assembled in this conference, to\nall the proceedings of which he has been listening over the radio and television.\n<\/p><p>\nAt the conclusion now he sends this message: \"President McKay: I should be very pleased if\nyou would express to the people my deep gratitude for the inspiration of the conference, and\nalso extend to my brethren and sisters my love and my prayers that the united efforts of all\nthe Saints may bring great advancement to the cause we love. Affectionately,\nStephen L Richards.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Stephen L: Let me assure you that there is but one heart in this great audience today,\nand it responds in reciprocation of your love and blessing. God bless you!\n<\/p><p>\nNow, may we take a few moments to express our gratitude to all who have contributed to the\ninspiration of the sessions held since last Saturday morning.\n<\/p><p>\nFirst, you who were here yesterday morning listened to an inspiring anthem, entitled \"Out of\nthe Silence,\" written by Elder Cyril Jenkins, one of our members and a holder of the\npriesthood in Australia, who has rendered great service to the Church in having the excellent\nselections of the Tabernacle Choir put on the radio stations in that far-off land, and who is\nnow in Great Britain, arranging with the British broadcasting stations to have the people in\nthat land have the privilege of hearing the excellent music rendered by this organization. We\nthank you, Brother Jenkins, and say God bless you, that you may achieve the noble purposes\nyou have in mind.\n<\/p><p>\nWe express gratitude and commendation for the responsiveness and attentiveness of the\naudiences. I wish particularly to commend you for your reverential attitude. This is a sacred\nbuilding, used for many purposes, it is true, until we get an auditorium that will take care of\nsome secular assemblies of the sessions. It is sacred, and we have noted that you have\ngoverned yourselves accordingly. From the moment that the clock marked the beginning of a\nsession, perfect order has prevailed. We ask that this example be followed by all the Saints in\ntheir ward chapels and in halls in which you meet to worship.\n<\/p><p>\nWe express appreciation for the cooperation of city officials. Their ready and efficient service\nhas been noted. The traffic officers have rendered valuable service in handling increased\ntraffic. We have already expressed appreciation to the Berkeley Stake for the calla lilies that\nhave beautified the building.\n<\/p><p>\nOur ushers have done excellent service! They volunteered last evening to put up a platform.\nThey had it removed early this morning. They have been ready and willing to look after the\npeople who had need of the emergency hospital, which has been on the grounds, and in every\nway have rendered service to add to the convenience of the many visitors who are here.\n<\/p><p>\nEspecially we mention appreciation to the various radio stations: here in our own city, KSL,\nand others in the state of Utah, in Idaho, in Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, California, Hawaii.\nManagers of these stations, no one can tell how many people have been blessed by your\nmagnanimity and co-operation. We thank you!\n<\/p><p>\nWe express appreciation to our singers. I do not know that we have ever had for every session\nsuch inspiring music rendered by the combined Scandinavian choirs Saturday, the Men's\nChorus of the Tabernacle Choir Saturday night, by our own Tabernacle Choir Sunday and by\nthe combined choruses of Brigham Young University today. I can scarcely refrain from\ncommenting on the inspiration that the presence of these young men and young women gives\nto us.\n<\/p><p>\n\"How beautiful is youth! how bright it gleams<br \/>\nWith its illusions, aspirations, dreams!<br \/>\nBook of Beginnings, story without end,<br \/>\nEvery maid a heroine, and each man a friend!\"\n<\/p><p>\nHow glorious is youth, and here are several hundred of them in our presence contributing\ntheir talents to the inspiration of our conference. Again, thank you.\n<\/p><p>\nTo all others who have in any way contributed to the excellency and the inspiration of this,\nthe 123rd conference, we express our gratitude.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, may I trespass upon your time a few moments to say a final word to\nyou mission presidents, to you presidencies of stakes, bishoprics of wards, to you officers,\nstake and local, to you mothers who are doing so much to make these new buildings to which\nreference has been made, so attractive, and in other ways contributing to the advancement of\nthe work.\n<\/p><p>\nMuch of what you brethren and sisters do we never hear about, and it seems as though you\nare working without any visible results, but no good deed, no kind word can be spoken\nwithout its effect being felt for good upon all. Sometimes the good may be infinitesimal, but\nas a rock that is thrown in a pool starts a wave from the center which continues to enlarge\nuntil every part of the shore is touched, so your deeds, silent, many of them, unknown\nunspoken, unheralded, continue to radiate and touch many hearts.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are not unappreciative of what you are doing. Nobody can go out to a dedicatory service\nof one of these meetinghouses, hear incidents, details, illustrations of what seem to be\nsacrifices of the hours and hours of work, given freely, without being deeply impressed with\nthe integrity and sincerity of the members of this Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThursday morning this building was crowded to capacity by Primary workers, representatives\nof one organization. That night, the hotel ballroom was crowded with former workers, general\nboard workers of the Primary, present workers, present officers from stakes. I wish the ten\nthousand people here could have seen the illustration and the examples they gave showing the\ngrowth of the Primary during the last seventy-five years.\n<\/p><p>\nFriday night this building was crowded to overflowing by the bishoprics of the Church, under\nthe direction of the Presiding Bishopric.\n<\/p><p>\nSaturday, seventeen thousand members of the priesthood filled this house the Assembly Hall,\nBarratt Hall, Field House at BYU, representing the priesthood of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have had a meeting of the patriarchs, another of mission presidents, another of welfare\nworkers, and one of stake missionaries.\n<\/p><p>\nWhy all these, and all other meetings in the Church? Tell me! They are held for the good of\nthe individual&mdash;for your son and my son, your daughter and mine. The Lord has said,\n\". . . If it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and\nbring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of\nmy Father! And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me\ninto the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls\nunto me!\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13088\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13088)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13088)\">D&amp;C 18:15-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe whole purpose of the organization of this great Church, so complete, so perfect, is to\nbless the individual. How that stands out in striking contrast, in opposition, to the claim of the\ncommunist who says that the individual is but a spoke in the wheel of the state that the state\nis all in all, the individual being but a contributing factor to the perpetuation and strength of\nthe state.\n<\/p><p>\nThat idea is diametrically opposed to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Jesus sought for a perfect\nsociety, \"not by agitating the people to revolt against political or social organizations, nor by\nany reorganization of existing conditions, but by perfecting the individual. He recognized the\nfallacy in the dream of those who hoped to make a perfect society out of imperfect\nindividuals.\" In all these labors and associations, he sought the perfection of the individual.\n<\/p><p>\nHis goal always set before his followers was the emancipation of men and women from\ngreed, from anger, from jealousy, from hatred, from fear; and in their place he hoped to bring\nabout a complete and normal development of the individual's divine powers through right\nthinking and unselfish efficient service.\n<\/p><p>\nHe promised no material rewards but he did promise perfected, divine\nmanhood, as we have heard in this conference. \"Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is\nin heaven is perfect\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34546\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34546)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34546)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd with that divine manhood comes the resultant happiness, true happiness.\n<\/p><p>\nFINAL BLESSING\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, my dear fellow workers, you General Authorities, stake presidencies,\nbishoprics, every officer and teacher throughout the land, every member. May the Spirit of the\nLord abide in your hearts, and in your homes, that people partaking of your radiation of\nhonesty, integrity, uprightness, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ will be led to glorify our\nFather in heaven (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34541\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34541)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34541)\">Matt. 5:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMany years ago&mdash;a Chinese philosopher expressed the thought that I am trying to give you,\nand the result of individual righteousness as follows: \n<\/p><p>\n\"If there is righteousness in the heart<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; there will be beauty in the character.<br \/>\nIf there is beauty in the character<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; there will be harmony in the home.<br \/>\nIf there is harmony in the home<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; there will be order in the nation.<br \/>\nIf there is order in the nation<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; there will be peace in the world.\"\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to bring about that peace in the only way that it can come, and that through\nobedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ, I pray in his holy name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
