Today such physical needs are met much more easily: flipping on a switch to control the light, adjusting the thermostat for heat and for cold. Modern conveniences grant us more free time to focus on spiritual needs and devote more time to personal service. But the basic element which should never change in the lives of righteous young women is giving service to others. Their divine role as caregivers helps noble womanhood gain \u201cthe highest place of honor in human life.\u201d Serving others can begin at almost any age. Often the greatest service to others is one-on-one. It need not be on a grand scale, and it is noblest within the family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/womanhood-the-highest-place-of-honor.p17\" class=\"\">I have reread the current Personal Progress requirements.

One of your unique, precious, and sublime gifts is your femininity, with its natural grace, goodness, and divinity. Femininity is not just lipstick, stylish hairdos, and trendy clothes. It is the divine adornment of humanity. It finds expression in your qualities of your capacity to love, your spirituality, delicacy, radiance, sensitivity, creativity, charm, graciousness, gentleness, dignity, and quiet strength. It is manifest differently in each girl or woman, but each of you possesses it. Femininity is part of your inner beauty.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/womanhood-the-highest-place-of-honor.p20\" class=\"\">One of your particular gifts is your feminine intuition. Do not limit yourselves. As you seek to know the will of our Heavenly Father in your life and become more spiritual, you will be far more attractive, even irresistible. You can use your smiling loveliness to bless those you love and all you meet, and spread great joy. Femininity is part of the God-given divinity within each of you. It is your incomparable power and influence to do good. You can, through your supernal gifts, bless the lives of children, women, and men. Be proud of your womanhood. Enhance it. Use it to serve others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/womanhood-the-highest-place-of-honor.p21\" class=\"\">Unfortunately, we see some very poor role models of womanhood in today\u2019s society. We see women boxers and wrestlers as we flip through the television channels trying to find something uplifting. I believe the women of our time need to be strong, but not in that sense. In my opinion, these activities demean the nobility of womanhood. Young women need to be strong in righteousness, and, to quote your current theme, \u201cto stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-20905_000_040\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40041\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40041)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40041)\">Mosiah 18:9<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/womanhood-the-highest-place-of-honor.p22\" class=\"\">Let me tell you of one young woman who has demonstrated remarkable strength in the face of great tragedy. On April 17, 1999, a big van broadsided a car and severely injured 16-year-old Emily Jensen. Her skull was fractured, and she was in a coma for three months, and six months in the hospital. She has had to learn everything again as if from birth. It would have been easy to give up, but giving up is not in Emily\u2019s vocabulary. She works so hard at recovery that she runs the equivalent of a 26-mile marathon every day. Her faith, courage, and perseverance have strengthened and motivated many other hospital patients.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/womanhood-the-highest-place-of-honor.p23\" class=\"\">Emily is still working very hard to regain her speech. Even so, she fearlessly asks nurses, technicians, and therapists, \u201cAre you a Mormon?\u201d If they reply no, she tells them in her muddled sentences, \u201cYou should be. Read the Book of Mormon.\u201d Emily dictated to her mother what she wanted written in five copies of the Book of Mormon that she gave to a doctor, three therapists, and a technician before she left the hospital.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/womanhood-the-highest-place-of-honor.p24\" class=\"\">Emily dearly loved one technician who had become totally inactive in the Church. They prayed together in Emily\u2019s hospital room. In language that was difficult to understand, but with a spirit that was strong and clear, Emily told her that she needed to go back to church. That technician later wrote Emily: \u201cI want to thank you so much for the Book of Mormon you gave me. I cried when I read what you wrote. I know someday I will love this book as much as you do.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/womanhood-the-highest-place-of-honor.p25\" class=\"\">Emily\u2019s life was recently brightened at Skyline High School in Salt Lake City. The student body picked her as this year\u2019s prom queen in recognition of her extraordinary courage. Her classmates stood and cheered as she struggled to the stage of the packed auditorium, supported on the arm of the student body president. Though she continues to go each day for therapy, Emily\u2019s life is still defined by her spiritual identity, her goodness, her kindness to others, and her strong testimony.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-20905_000_040\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Letter from Terri F.
