That was understandable. He had never seen a missionary until he was one, because no young missionaries serve in Nepal.\u00a0He did not read English well enough to understand the instructions included with his call. When he reported to the missionary training center, instead of bringing nice slacks, white shirts, and ties, he packed, in his words, \u201cfive pairs of denim jeans, a couple of T-shirts, and a lot of hair gel.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-10711_000_023\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Ashish Pokhrel, \u201cMy Name Is Ashish Pokhrel and This Is My Story\u201d (unpublished personal history, Sept. 2011).]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/11\/priesthood-session\/called-of-him-to-declare-his-word.p7\" class=\"\">Even after he obtained appropriate clothing, he said he felt inadequate every day during the first few weeks.
