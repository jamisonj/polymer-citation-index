After World War II was over, I was married and wanted to get on with my life. My memorable mission was finished before my military service. I was not anxious to become a student again and go back to the university where I had started some eight years before. My intended course would require another three years of intensive study, discipline, and poverty. With all of this in mind I said to my father, \u201cI don\u2019t think I will go back to school. I\u2019ll just get a job or start a business and go forward in my life.\u201d Now, my father had completed law school after World War I as an older student with a wife and three children. His response was typically direct. He said bluntly, \u201cWhat can you do?\u201d His answer was so brutally honest that it hurt, but I could not ignore it. I went back to the university and completed the course. This frank but well-intentioned message changed my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/unwanted-messages.p8\" class=\"\">In the time of Jesus, a certain ruler asked the Savior a very significant question and received a hard answer which he did not want to hear.

One is to respect the Sabbath day. While the Savior himself cautioned against extreme forms of Sabbath day observance, it is well to remember whose day the Sabbath is. There seems to be an ever-increasing popularity in disregarding the centuries-old commandment to observe and respect the Sabbath day. For many it has become a holiday rather than a holy day of rest and sanctification. For some it is a day to shop and buy groceries. The decision of those who engage in shopping, sports, work, and recreation on the Sabbath day is their own, for which they alone bear responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/unwanted-messages.p19\" class=\"\">The Lord\u2019s commandment about the Sabbath day has not been altered, nor has the Church\u2019s affirmation of the commandment to observe the Sabbath day. Those who violate this commandment in the exercise of their agency are answerable for losing the blessings which observance of this commandment would bring. The Lord has spoken in our day concerning the Sabbath day. We are to keep ourselves \u201cunspotted from the world\u201d and \u201cgo to the house of prayer.\u201d We are to rest from our labors and pay our \u201cdevotions unto the Most High\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18447\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18447)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18447)\">D&amp;C 59:9\u201310<\/a><\/span>).

I have frequently walked by a rest home that provides excellent care. But it is heartrending to see so many parents and grandparents in that good care facility so forgotten, so bereft of dignity, so starved for love. To honor parents certainly means to take care of physical needs. But it means much, much more. It means to show love, kindness, thoughtfulness, and concern for them all of the days of their lives. It means to help them preserve their dignity and self-respect in their declining years. It means to honor their wishes and desires and their teachings both before and after they are dead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/unwanted-messages.p21\" class=\"\">Some years ago I created a stake on one of the islands in Japan. As usual, we held many interviews with the leaders to become acquainted with them. One of the men had moved to that area from Tokyo to take care of his aged and ailing father and his father\u2019s business, which was in difficulty because of the father\u2019s ill health. After the father died, the son went to his father\u2019s creditors and acknowledged his father\u2019s debts. He requested time from those creditors so that he could assume and pay all of his father\u2019s outstanding obligations. In our interview I asked him how he was managing to meet this responsibility. He answered that he was getting along quite well and that he would be able to handle his father\u2019s debts. The Lord saw fit to honor him with a call to be one of the leaders of that stake.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/unwanted-messages.p22\" class=\"\">Besides being one of God\u2019s commandments, the kind, thoughtful consideration of parents is a matter of common decency and self-respect.

Children often take license from their parents\u2019 behavior and go beyond the values the parents wish to establish. There is one safe parental rule: do not just avoid evil, avoid the very appearance of evil (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"2763\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2763)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2763)\">1 Thes. 5:22<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/unwanted-messages.p24\" class=\"\">I should like to speak of one more strong message. It is frequently astounding to see the dereliction of people in keeping the standards of ordinary fairness and justice. This delinquency manifests itself in so many ways. It is sometimes evident in commercial transactions, as well as in private contacts. Injustice to others is manifest even in the way automobiles are sometimes driven. This unfairness and injustice results principally from one person seeking an advantage or an edge over another. Those who follow such a practice demean themselves greatly. How can those of us who do not practice ordinary fairness and justice have serious claim on the blessings of a just and a fair God?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/unwanted-messages.p25\" class=\"\">Do some of us seek to justify our taking of shortcuts and advantage of others by indulging in the twin sophistries, \u201cThere isn\u2019t any justice\u201d and \u201cEverybody does it\u201d? There are many others who seemingly prosper by violating the rules of God and the standards of decency and fair play.

Worrying about the punishment we think ought to come to others is self-defeating to us. Brigham Young counseled that unless we ourselves are prepared for the day of the Lord\u2019s vengeance when the wicked will be consumed, we should not be too anxious for the Lord to hasten his work. Said he rather, \u201cLet our anxiety be centered upon this one thing, the sanctification of our own hearts, the purifying of our own affections\u201d (in <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 9:3).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/unwanted-messages.p26\" class=\"\">Many modern professors of human behavior advocate as a cure to an afflicted conscience that we simply ignore the unwanted messages. They suggest that we change the standard to fit the circumstances so that there is no longer a conflict, thus easing the conscience.

For the troubled conscience in conflict with right and wrong, the only permanent help is to change the behavior and follow a repentant path.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/unwanted-messages.p27\" class=\"\">The prophet Isaiah taught, \u201cWoe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25615\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25615)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25615)\">Isa. 5:20<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/unwanted-messages.p28\" class=\"\">During all of my ministry, I have been fascinated by the manner in which Jesus hardened the bone and spirit of his chief Apostle, Peter.
