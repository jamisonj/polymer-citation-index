This heritage provides a foundation built of sacrifice and faith. Ours is the privilege and responsibility to build on such firm and stable footings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/in-search-of-treasure.p18\" class=\"\">A story written by Karen Nolen, which appeared in the <span class=\"emphasis\">New Era<\/span> in 1974, tells of a Benjamin Landart who, in 1888, was 15 years old and an accomplished violinist. Living on a farm in northern Utah with his mother and seven brothers and sisters was sometimes a challenge to Benjamin, as he had less time than he would have liked to play his violin. Occasionally his mother would lock up the violin until he had his farm chores done, so great was the temptation for Benjamin to play it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/in-search-of-treasure.p19\" class=\"\">In late 1892 Benjamin was asked to travel to Salt Lake to audition for a place with the territorial orchestra. For him, this was a dream come true. After several weeks of practicing and prayers, he went to Salt Lake in March of 1893 for the much anticipated audition. When he heard Benjamin play, the conductor, a Mr. Dean, told Benjamin he was the most accomplished violinist he had heard west of Denver. He was told to report to Denver for rehearsals in the fall and learned that he would be earning enough to keep himself, with some left over to send home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/in-search-of-treasure.p20\" class=\"\">A week after Benjamin received the good news, however, his bishop called him into his office and asked if he couldn\u2019t put off playing with the orchestra for a couple of years. He told Benjamin that before he started earning money there was something he owed the Lord. He then asked Benjamin to accept a mission call.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/in-search-of-treasure.p21\" class=\"\">Benjamin felt that giving up his chance to play in the territorial orchestra would be almost more than he could bear, but he also knew what his decision should be. He promised the bishop that if there were any way to raise the money for him to serve, he would accept the call.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/in-search-of-treasure.p22\" class=\"\">When Benjamin told his mother about the call, she was overjoyed. She told him that his father had always wanted to serve a mission but had been killed before that opportunity had come to him. However, when they discussed the financing of the mission, her face clouded over. Benjamin told her he would not allow her to sell any more of their land. She studied his face for a moment and then said, \u201cBen, there is a way we can raise the money. This family [has] one thing that is of great enough value to send you on your mission. You will have to sell your violin.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/in-search-of-treasure.p23\" class=\"\">Ten days later, on March 23, 1893, Benjamin wrote in his journal: \u201cI awoke this morning and took my violin from its case. All day long I played the music I love. In the evening when the light grew dim and I could see to play no longer, I placed the instrument in its case. It will be enough. Tomorrow I leave [for my mission].\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/in-search-of-treasure.p24\" class=\"\">Forty-five years later, on June 23, 1938, Benjamin wrote in his journal: \u201cThe greatest decision I ever made in my life was to give up something I dearly loved to the God I loved even more.

They made plans for the most wonderful creation of their lives. They gathered building materials from all over the neighborhood and carried them up to a part of the tree where two branches provided an ideal location for the house. It was difficult, and they were anxious to complete their work. The vision of the finished tree house provided tremendous motivation for them to complete the project.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/in-search-of-treasure.p43\" class=\"\">They worked all summer, and finally in the fall just before school began for the new year, their house was completed. Elder Brough said he will never forget the feelings of joy and satisfaction which were theirs when they finally were able to enjoy the fruit of their work. They sat in the tree house, looked around for a few minutes, climbed down from the tree\u2014and never returned. The completed project, as wonderful as it was, could not hold their interest for even one day. In other words, the process of planning, gathering, building, and working\u2014not the completed project\u2014provided the enduring satisfaction and pleasure they had experienced.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/in-search-of-treasure.p44\" class=\"\">Let us relish life as we live it and, as did Elder Brough and his brother, Max, find joy in the journey.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/05\/in-search-of-treasure.p45\" class=\"\">The old adage \u201cNever put off until tomorrow what you can do today\u201d is doubly important when it comes to expressing our love and affection\u2014in word and in deed\u2014to family members and friends.
