Cullimore, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1968, pp. 36-40<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\nSince next Sunday is Easter Sunday, I want to direct my remarks to this important day and the circumstances surrounding it.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are two great festal days in the Christian year: one is Christmas and the other is Easter. The first is in honor of the Lord's coming into the world. It is a glorious occasion. Wherever there are a home and children, in every quarter of the world, there is joy on this great occasion. Old grudges disappear, feuds are forgotten, and love flows from heart to heart at Christmas time.\n<\/p><p><b>\nThe Lord is risen\n<\/b><\/p><p>\nYet Christmas is less a day of victory than Easter, for the story that begins then is incomplete until it is crowned by the announcement, \"The Lord is risen.\" Someone has so beautifully said: \"If the Savior, having breathed his last on the cross, had never come back to the world in life as he promised, then the Star of Bethlehem might as well never have flamed, the angels as well never have sung 'Glory to God in the Highest' in the midnight sky, and the wise men from the east need not have taken their journey to find the babe in the manger. We might have wept over our crucified king if he had never risen from the dead, but we sound his praises now because he lives and reigns forever and ever.\" (Author unknown.)\n<\/p><p>\nThe story is told of a man walking down a street in Chicago who came to a store window where there was displayed a beautiful picture of the crucifixion. As he stood going spellbound at the vivid picture story, he suddenly became conscious that at his side stood a little boy. The boy too was gazing at the picture, and his tense expression made the man know that the crucifixion had really gripped the eager little soul. Touching the boy on the shoulder, the man said, \"Sonny, what does it mean?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Don'cha know?\" he answered, his face full of the marvel of the man's ignorance. \"That there man is Jesus, and them others is Roman soldiers, and the woman crying is his mother, and,\" he added, \"they killed him.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe man was loath to leave the window, but he could not tarry always at the tragic scene, so he turned away and walked down the street. In a few moments he heard pattering footsteps, and there came rushing toward him the little boy.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Say, mister!\" he exclaimed breathlessly. \"I forgot to tell you, but he rose again!\"\n<\/p><p><b>\nThe conquest of death\n<\/b><\/p><p>\nYes, he rose again. The advent on earth of the Redeemer is of less importance than the conquest of death and the grave, for it was only by rising from the grave that he could redeem the world. Hence, his resurrection signalizes the redemption of mankind and becomes one of the greatest of all occasions for every child of God.\n<\/p><p>\nOur author continues: \"It required the resurrection to complete the work of redemption. The marvel of the manger birth attracted little attention from an ancient people, accustomed to accept the marvelous. The miracle of Galilee failed to astound a world that treated miracles as a matter of course. The martyrdom of Calvary was not in itself sufficient to prove that Jesus was the Savior of the world; but when the angel of the resurrection showed the weeping followers of Jesus an empty tomb on the morning of the first resurrection, no one who accepted the story with a saving faith could deny that the Nazarene was the world's Savior and the conqueror of death.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYes, he rose again, for you and me&mdash;for all the children of God&mdash;that we might not be lost but that we might live again and have immortality and eternal life. Unto every man, woman, and child he brought immortality. Listen to the words of Alma: \"Now, there is a death which is called a temporal death; and the death of Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death, that all shall be raised from this temporal death.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9086\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9086)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9086)\">Alma 11:42-44<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p>\nPaul said: \"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"486\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 486)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(486)\">1 Cor. 15:21-22<\/a><\/span>)\n<\/p><p><b>\nGift of eternal life\n<\/b><\/p><p>\nAll this comes without effort on our part through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Talmage: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, had passed, and the night preceding the dawn of the most memorable Sunday in history was well nigh spent, while the Roman guard kept watch over the sealed sepulchre wherein lay the body of the Lord Jesus. While it was yet dark, the earth began to quake; an angel of the Lord descended in glory, rolled back the massive stone from the portal of the tomb, and sat upon it. His countenance was brilliant as the lightning, and his raiment was as the driven snow for whiteness. The soldiers, paralyzed with fear, fell to the earth as dead men. When they partially recovered from their fright, they fled from the place in tenor. Even the rigor of Roman discipline, which decreed summary death to every soldier who deserted his post, could not deter them. Moreover, there was nothing left for them to guard; the seal of authority had been broken, the sepulchre was open, and empty.\" (James E. Talmage, Jesus the Christ, p. 678.) The Lord had risen.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . .
