I was excited and anxious for this opportunity. My mother went with me, and we arrived a little early. The meeting was held in the building where I had attended church until I went away to college. I had not been back for a long time, and I did not anticipate what would happen when I walked inside the front doors. A flood of memories came washing over me, and I began to cry. My mother looked at me and said, \u201cElaine, don\u2019t start that now.\u201d But the tears flowed as I viewed the office at the top of the beautiful marble stairs where my father had served as the bishop. As I reached the top of the stairs, the door to the bishop\u2019s office was open. I went inside and saw that it had been converted to a small classroom, and again a flood of memories came washing over me. In my mind\u2019s eye, I could see my father sitting behind the desk and myself as a little girl sitting on the chair in front of it paying tithing and as a young woman having interviews and receiving priesthood blessings. My love for that building was deeply tied to the spiritual experiences and feelings I had had there.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/believe.p6\" class=\"\">Often as a young girl I would accompany my bishop father to the church and wait until his meetings or interviews were over. I would busy myself by exploring. I knew every nook and cranny of that building. One of my favorite rooms was the tower room. It was a large room at the top of some steep steps. Inside there was a picture of the Savior, which hung over a large fireplace. I was always drawn to that room. I would ascend the steps and reverently go inside. I would sit on a chair and look at the picture of the Savior and pray to Heavenly Father. These were simple prayers. But always when I prayed, a very special feeling seemed to engulf me, and I knew that He heard my childlike prayers. This is where I began to believe.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/believe.p7\" class=\"\">The Lord has promised us that as we \u201csearch diligently, pray always, and <span class=\"emphasis\">be believing,<\/span> \u2026 all things [will] work together for [our] good\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43605\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43605)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43605)\">D&amp;C 90:24<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added).

She learned English, and she purchased her very own scriptures. When she visited our home, she read reverently from her new scriptures. She loved them. I noticed that almost everything on every page was underlined in yellow. I said, \u201cSister Sarantsetseg, your scriptures look like the golden plates.\u201d She replied, \u201cI only underline the things I like.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/believe.p20\" class=\"\">Everything in the scriptures is applicable to our lives.

I had a constant prayer in my heart, and I would seek solitary places where I would pour out my soul in prayer to my Heavenly Father to heal my father. After a few weeks of illness, my father passed away. I was shocked and frightened. What would our family do without our father whom we loved so dearly? How could we go on? I felt that Heavenly Father had not heard nor answered my fervent prayers. My faith was challenged. I went to Heavenly Father and asked the question\u2014\u201cHeavenly Father, are you really there?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/believe.p22\" class=\"\">Over a period of many months, I prayed for help and guidance. I prayed for my family, and I prayed to understand why my father had not been healed. For a time, it seemed to me that the heavens were silent, but as a family we continued to pray for comfort and guidance. I continued to pray also. Then one day, many months later, as I was sitting in a sacrament meeting, my answer came in the form of a scripture. The speaker said: \u201cTrust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43224\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43224)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43224)\">Prov. 3:5\u20136<\/a><\/span>).
