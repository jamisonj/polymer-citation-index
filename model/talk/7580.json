She had exhausted her means in search of a medical solution but had found none. In a crowd of people, the woman approached the Savior from behind and touched the hem of His garment. Jesus wanted to know who had touched Him because He felt that power had gone out of Him. The Apostles could not understand the question and asked, \u201cMaster, the multitude throng[s] thee and press[es] thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-02205_000_036\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"51630\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51630)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51630)\">Luke 8:45<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> The woman then with great fear and trembling confessed that it was she who had approached Him and had been immediately healed. The Savior sent her away in peace, telling her that her faith had made her whole.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/one-among-the-crowd.p6\" class=\"\">There is much to learn and ponder in this interesting little story.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/one-among-the-crowd.p7\" class=\"\">I picture the crowd itself. It must have been fairly large, as people were pressing in on Jesus. It might even have been a noisy crowd, as people pushed and shoved trying to get a better look at Him. I wonder why they were there. Most, I think, came out of curiosity. Wherever He went, news of His arrival and stories of His miracles preceded Him. Perhaps they expected to see something out of the ordinary, an event not to be missed. Though not mentioned, there were likely Pharisees in the crowd, who always seemed to be close by, watching for opportunity to entrap, embarrass, or find something with which they could condemn Jesus. Could it be possible that some in the crowd even came to mock?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/one-among-the-crowd.p8\" class=\"\">Among the crowd was a woman. I see a humble woman, perhaps even a timid woman, approaching the Savior from behind and then with embarrassment confessing that she had touched the hem of His garment. She was a woman exhausted and impoverished by her difficulties. She was desperate for help. Outwardly, there was little to distinguish her from any other person in the crowd. No one tried to stop her from moving toward Jesus. Certainly, the Apostles neither noticed her nor made any attempt to stop her. But there was something that set her apart from all others in the crowd that day. Though buried among the thronging mass, she resolutely and quietly pressed forward with a single purpose in mind: to come to the Savior, having faith that He had the power to heal her, that He cared about her and would respond to her need. In this one thing she set herself apart from the crowd. The crowd came to see, but the woman came to be healed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/one-among-the-crowd.p9\" class=\"\">There are other interesting accounts in the scriptures of one faithful person among a crowd. Alma was among the wicked priests of King Noah. These were men described as being lifted up in the pride of their hearts, lazy and idolatrous, who spoke lying and vain words to the people.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-02205_000_036\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51793\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51793)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51793)\">Mosiah 11:5\u201311<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> They had perverted the ways of the Lord because they had not applied their hearts to understanding.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-02205_000_036\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51794\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51794)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51794)\">Mosiah 12:25\u201327<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> When Abinadi delivered his message of repentance, they mocked him and finally put him to death.
