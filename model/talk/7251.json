Late December 2004 brought a terrible earthquake off the coast of Indonesia creating a deadly tsunami that killed thousands and shattered the lives of those who remained behind.

Many employees, who are not of our faith, volunteered to go with him every weekend to give assistance in the storm-stricken areas. Walkie-talkies were used for communication along the way. Mike\u2019s high priests group leader, while driving along with them in his pickup truck, said he had white knuckles from driving so fast. Trying to slow the convoy down, he got on the walkie-talkie and said, \u201cGentlemen, do you realize we are going 80 miles per hour?\u201d One of the truck drivers came on and said, \u201cWell, you have to understand that\u2019s all these big trucks will do.

One 92-year-old great-grandmother has produced several hundred blankets. In her case, both the creator and receiver have been blessed. As her son admired her handiwork, she asked, \u201cDo you think anyone will ever use one of my blankets?\u201d A letter from a young mother in Louisiana answers that question:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/05\/tender-hearts-and-helping-hands.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cI live in Louisiana, and I go to a local health unit for my children.
