I have always felt myself among the least, and this afternoon, I\nam certain I am very nearly among the last. However that may be, I need your prayers and\ninvite them, so that while I speak to you I may be an instrument in the hands of God to offer\nsomething of value to us all.\n<\/p><p>\nPROPHECY BEING FULFILLED\n<\/p><p>\nThis forenoon when the statistics of the Church were read I felt as I always feel on occasions\nof this kind, that prophecy is being fulfilled. Before the Church was organized the Lord spoke\nto the Prophet Joseph and said to him that a marvelous work was about to come forth among\nthe children of men (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12588\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12588)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12588)\">D&amp;C 4:1<\/a><\/span>).\nThe six young men who sat around the table on April 6, 1830, and under\ndivine instruction organized the Church, believed it to be true that they were setting out, and\nputting into operation, a marvelous work of the latter days. No prophecy has been more\ncompletely fulfilled than that. From six men in an obscure home near a remote village in New\nYork state has grown this great institution. The statistical condition of the Church as outlined\nto us today is almost beyond the dreams of men.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear my testimony to the reality of this great work, that it is of God, that God instituted it,\nthat he spoke to Joseph Smith, and has spoken to his Church ever since, and that we are\nengaged in the great work of redeeming the human race.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is good to be with you, good to meet together, knowing our destiny, the work we have to\ndo, and the great reward that the Lord will offer us, in course of time, if, as was said this\nforenoon, we keep close to the commandments of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nThose of us who expect to be called upon at these great conferences always have to cast about\nfor some suitable theme to speak upon, some subject of special importance to the people of\nthe Church at the time. I did so myself and finally hit upon a subject that I thought\nrepresented a problem of the day of sufficient importance to occupy a part of the time at this\ngreat conference. My thoughts were pretty well organized, and I was ready to deliver the\nmessage as best I could until last Sunday forenoon when President Smith dropped a remark in\nhis introductory speech, which President McKay also mentioned. One or two other speakers\ntouched upon it also. I was so impressed that I had to change my subject, not because they\ncovered the ground I intended to cover, but because I was impressed to say something in the\nfield that they had mentioned.\n<\/p><p>\nEDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Smith spoke of education among the Latter-day Saints. With proper humility he\nspoke of our great achievements in the educational field. It is a pardonable pride that we have\nin our educational achievements. We have the right to feel glad that we have achieved great\nthings educationally. We have always known that we cannot get very far in any worthy\nendeavor without education. \"The glory of God is intelligence\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12707\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12707)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12707)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>), which means knowledge, plus\nthe proper use of knowledge, has been a beacon light of the Church. We have talked about\neducation, we have tried to secure it ever since the beginning of the Church to these days. We\ndo have a remarkable educational history. You see, I spent a good part of my life in the\nprofession of teaching, and whenever the subject is mentioned, I respond much as the old,\nretired, fire-engine horse responds when the fire bell rings.  \n<\/p><p>\nThe Church had scarcely been organized when our people began to talk about education. They\nwanted to provide schools and books for schools. In the difficult times of the earliest days, the\nProphet wrote a letter to the Church and said that not only were the people to secure schools\nand schoolbooks, but also if such means were not available, then the fathers and the mothers\nshould act as instructors to the youth in their homes. The Church began its work on the\nfoundation of moral, mental, and spiritual education.\n<\/p><p>\nSCHOOL OF THE PROPHETS\n<\/p><p>\nLater on, when the Church was still young, hard-handed toilers on the farm and in the shop,\nwho had been made converts to the Church, entered the school of the prophets which had\nbeen founded for the mature. It is thrilling to look back over our history to the time of the\nKirtland Temple. The men left their farms, fields, and shops in the evenings and climbed to\nthe top story, the attic story of the Kirtland Temple, there, in provided classrooms, to study\nvarious subjects, languages, mathematics, history, geography, and a variety of subjects. Really\nour people began there what we call today adult education. It was thought that an older man\ncould not learn; only young people could learn. Since that time the world has come to quite a\ndifferent conclusion. Today a man is never too old to learn. A woman is never too old to\nlearn. The power to assimilate knowledge remains with us to the last day. Somehow these\nforebears of ours in the Church understood that.\n<\/p><p>\nUNIVERSITIES ESTABLISHED\n<\/p><p>\nThen a little later they came to Nauvoo and organized a university. I am not certain for I have\nnot looked it up, but I suspect that the University of the City of Nauvoo was one of the first\ncity tax-supported universities in America. The Church made educational history there.\n<\/p><p>\nIn time we came here, to Utah, to a barren wilderness. There was work to be done here.\nRoads, irrigation ditches were to be made; crops were to be raised. A living was to he won\nfrom the desert. It was a difficult time. Yet one of the first acts of our territorial legislature\nwas to found a great university, the University of Deseret (now the University of Utah),\nmaking it the first university founded west of the Missouri River.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Church has a noble educational history. We all know that. What I want to say is\nsomething about education itself. It will not take me long. Education may or may not be a\ngood thing. It depends on what we learn. Education is really the accumulated knowledge of\nmankind, passed on from generation to generation. Each teacher passes on to his pupils that\nwhich the world knows. In that way we all benefit from that knowledge and we preserve that\nknowledge for those who come after us. This accumulated knowledge of mankind, the\nknowledge of the world, falls into several distinct parts. Two of the major parts I would like\nto mention.\n<\/p><p>\nFACTUAL KNOWLEDGE\n<\/p><p>\nAll knowledge falls first into a part or division or group that we call factual. Sometimes we\ncall it truth, which amounts to the same thing. Facts of observation, that which we hear with\nour ears, see with our eyes, that we recognize through the various senses that the Lord has\nbestowed upon us make up the first and most important part of knowledge. That kind of\nknowledge is everlasting, unchanging. Under the same conditions a fact will appear the same\nthroughout the countless coming ages.\n<\/p><p>\nHUMAN INTERPRETATIONS\n<\/p><p>\nThe other division of human knowledge, speaking of the major divisions only, is made up of\nthe human interpretations, explanations, and inferences of the observed facts, the truths in our\npossession. These inferences, explanations, and theories, interpretations of truth, may or may\nnot be correct. They usually change as more knowledge is acquired by humanity. If education\nconsists chiefly of learning what men have said or thought about the facts of nature and\nexistence, it may mislead students, may lead them into difficult places, often into places of\nuntruth. It is only when education confines itself primarily as to truth, to facts, as observed, it\nbecomes worthwhile. That is not saying anything against the interpretations of truth. We have\nthe scriptures as an example. We have the right to interpret them as we see fit, but we have\nno right to teach them as we see fit. We must teach truth as it is given us, whether it be in the\ndomain of revelation or of science or any other field of human activity.\n<\/p><p>\nOBLIGATION OF TEACHERS\n<\/p><p>\nTherein lies a tremendous danger to our young people and the coming generations. An honest\nteacher, unless he is ignorant, will place before his students&mdash;I speak both of students in the\nChurch schools and in state schools, I draw no distinctions&mdash;the truth as discovered by many,\nor revealed by God, and when interpretations are taught, he will label them as such, and say,\n\"This is an interpretation by man of existing truth.\" That should be done in our priesthood\nquorums, in auxiliary organizations and in all schools of learning attended by our young\npeople. This is important, of the greatest importance, in the building of happy lives, in a\nworld of peace. President Smith said something last Sunday that pointed in that direction, and\nit has clung to my mind until I had to speak of it this afternoon.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have also the field of speculation, very closely related to the field of interpreting truth. If\none wants to see how absolutely confusing and useless and untruthful the field of speculation\nis, let him go to the philosophers of the ages. Begin with the old philosophers and go down to\nthe philosophers of today. Everyone has tried to explain or describe God. Not one has failed\nto try his hand at it. Everyone has set up his own explanation and presented his own kind of\nGod. As you read after them, you find yourself in a state of confusion. Great minds, great\nthinkers, have tried throughout the ages to solve the same problem and have failed utterly to\nagree. That is because they have not begun with truth. Therein we are strong. Joseph Smith,\non his knees in the grove, saw God and spoke to him. There is no question about the\nbeginnings of this work. God does live, a personal being. We are made in his image. We are\ncarrying out his purposes.\n<\/p><p>\nThe distinction between a fact and an inference is, or should be, pretty generally understood. I\nbear you my testimony here this afternoon that in all of our teachings we must discriminate,\ndistinguish between the facts of human knowledge and the interpretation of the facts.\nInterpretations change from day to day. Once in a great while an interpretation of a great truth\nbecomes a truth itself, but very seldom. Usually there is too much of the humanity of us,\nmixed in with explained truth. So that we cannot well trust our interpretations.\n<\/p><p>\nRIGHTS OF CITIZENS\n<\/p><p>\nI do not like to have my taxes spent, or my tithing spent, for that matter, in the support of a\nteacher who does not understand the difference here discussed and who will not be honest\nenough as he stands before classes to say, \"This is a fact, as far as we understand it, and this\nis but an attempted inference of the fact which may or may not be right.\" I have no objection\nto a man who is an atheist, teaching outside of the Church. His faith is his concern, not mine.\nI would like to convert him to a knowledge of God. But, when he stands before his classes\nand talks about God and his own atheism, he is going beyond his rights. He is not employed\nfor that purpose. As a citizen, I have rights. It is my money and your money used to support\nthe schools whether in our out of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThis may be a schoolroom talk this afternoon, but if so, blame it on President Smith and\nPresident McKay. It was their remarks Sunday that started my mind thinking about this very\nimportant subject. We have truth. We are not concerned much with interpretation of truth.\nThe sorrows of the world may be traced back, now or in the past to false interpretations of\neternal truth. I hope you will also think about the applications of knowledge to daily life, but\nthat is another subject.\n<\/p><p>\nMy time is up. I am very happy, may I say again, to be in this conference. Not the words\nalone have made this a great conference, but the spirit which has been present and which has\ntouched our hearts. I do not remember all that has been said; I shall read the sermons when\nthey are printed; but I have felt the spirit of the Church and its people who are building the\nkingdom of God, and in so doing are moving on toward the completion of the great plan of\nsalvation laid out by the Father himself in the pre-existent state.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us, keep us faithful and true, helpful in this great work, and may we be given the\nblessings of health and strength, the things we need to carry on this work, I pray in the name\nof the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
