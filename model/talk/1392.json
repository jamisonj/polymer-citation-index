Brown, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1965, pp. 39-44<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nThis is at once an inspiring and humbling experience when one instinctively desires to have\ndivine guidance. It is most encouraging to have the President of the Church sitting on the\nstand and to know of his sympathy and blessings and well wishes.\n<\/p><p>\nWe welcome all, of course, as has been said, who are attending the conference. To emphasize\nwhat has been said in previous sessions and for the information of our friends and our\nmembers, may we for a few moments review some aspects of the religion and philosophy of\nthis newly revealed but ancient Church.\n<\/p><p>\nHere is a religious philosophy of divine origin which was taught by the prophets and Apostles\nof old, and this time was designated by them as \". . . the times of restitution of all things,\nwhich God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7978\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7978)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7978)\">Acts 3:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Dispensation of the Fulness of Times<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times referred to by Paul in Ephesians 1:10: \n<\/p><p>\n\"That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in\nChrist, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21767\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21767)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21767)\">Eph. 1:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a philosophy which if followed would provide a solution to the problems of our\ndistraught and imperiled world.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A Living Personal God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe cornerstone of this restored gospel is faith in a Living and Personal God, the Supreme\nBeing. The head of the corner is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the same as was so fearlessly\ndefended and proclaimed by Peter throughout his ministry. One revealing passage is recorded\nin the Acts of the Apostles as follows: \n<\/p><p>\n\"This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the\ncorner.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given\namong men, whereby we must be saved\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7980\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7980)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7980)\">Acts 4:11-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Man Created In the Image of God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe believe that man was created in the image of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23708\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23708)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23708)\">Gen. 1:26-27<\/a><\/span>)\nand was placed upon the earth as an\nembodied spirit that he might have the experience of mortal life, which is an intermediate\nstate between preexistence and immortality.\n<\/p><p>\nPursuant to divine plan, there was a transgression on the part of our first parents, and as a\nresult they were given mortal bodies, and they and all of their descendants became subject to\nthe dissolution of spirit and body through death.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A Redeemer<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAlso in the divine plan provision was made for a redeemer to break the bands of death and\nthrough the resurrection make possible the reunion of the spirits and bodies of all who\ntabernacle in the flesh. Thus provision was made for the redemption from death of all\nmankind through the atonement of Christ and for their salvation and exaltation on condition\nof obedience to the principles of the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Church in the Meridian of Time<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHe made provision for the establishment of his Church in the Meridian of Time, and he\ninstructed his Apostles to complete the organization of the Church and to carry its message to\nall the world.\n<\/p><p>\nBut after his crucifixion and the subsequent death of the Apostles, there was a general falling\naway from the primitive Church. In other words, a universal apostasy followed shortly after\nthe crucifixion, and through this apostasy the priesthood ceased to be operative, and as we\nread in Eusebius, \". . . when the sacred choir of apostles became extinct, and the generation of\nthose that had been privileged to hear their inspired wisdom had passed away, then also the\ncombinations of impious error arose by the fraud and delusions of false teachers. These also,\nas there were none of the apostles left, henceforth attempted, without shame to preach their\nfalse doctrine against the gospel of truth.\" Confusion and contention dominated the scene as\nmen attempted on their own authority to establish churches.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Church Re-established<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe announcement of the reestablishment of the Church of Jesus Christ by his own personal\nappearance was followed by visits from other heavenly beings who restored the priesthood\nand authorized and supervised the reorganization of the Church. Now this forms the burden of\nour message. The mission of the Church thus restored is to preach the gospel and administer\nin its ordinances among all nations preparatory to the second advent of our Savior.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Mortality, One Stage in the Eternal Plan<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMan's period of earth life is but one stage in the eternal progressive journey of the soul. Birth\nand death do not mark the beginning nor the end of existence. The spirits of all men lived as\nintelligent beings, enjoying the right of choice and free agency before they were born in the\nflesh. Earth life is for the development and training of the sons of men under the direction\nand supervision of the Divine Father through his Son Jesus the Christ. Here we have an\nopportunity to meet opposition, to test our strength, to combat and overcome evil and thereby\nprepare for future development throughout the eternities. This was the purpose of the creation\nof the earth, that men might take upon themselves bodies and become candidates for\nimmortality and eternal life. Dr. James E. Talmage sums up the discussion of creation of the\nuniverse as follows: \n<\/p><p>\n\"What is man in this boundless setting of sublime splendor? I answer you: Potentially now,\nactually to be, he is greater and grander, more precious in the arithmetic of God, than all the\nplanets and suns of space. For him were they created; they are the handiwork of God; man is\nhis son. In this world man is given dominion over a few things. It is his privilege to achieve\nsupremacy over many things.\n<\/p><p>\n\"'The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handiwork'\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41849\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41849)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41849)\">Ps. 19:1<\/a><\/span>). Incomprehensibly grand as are the physical creations of the earth and space, they have\nbeen brought into existence as a means to an end, necessary to the realization of the supreme\npurpose, which in the words of the creator is thus declared: 'For behold, this is my work and\nmy glory&mdash;to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man'\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39234\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39234)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39234)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Pre-mortal Existence<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAll who accept the Holy Scriptures as the word of God must believe the doctrine of the\npreexistence of Christ and also of all the sons of God. Christ lived with the Father as an\nunembodied spirit as is noted by the inspired words of John the Beloved, who said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The same was in the beginning with God.\n<\/p><p>\n\"All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.\n<\/p><p>\n\"In him was life; and the life was the light of men . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as\nof the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28156\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28156)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28156)\">John 1:1-4,14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHe who was the Firstborn of the Father's spirit children and the Only Begotten of the Father\nin the flesh repeatedly referred to his preexistent state and declared that he came forth from\nthe Father and would return to him on the completion of his mission in mortality. In John\n3:13, we read: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son\nof man which is in heaven\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28168\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28168)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28168)\">John 3:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again in John 6:38, the Savior said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28178\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28178)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28178)\">John 6:38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Christ, Redeemer and Savior of Mankind<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nChrist was chosen before the foundation of the world to be the Redeemer and Savior of\nmankind. John had a vision to which he refers in Revelation. He saw one, Lucifer, known as\nthe son of the morning, or Satan the dragon, who led the rebellion, and John declares: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the\ndragon fought and his angels\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42386\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42386)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42386)\">Rev. 12:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThose among these unembodied spirits who, as Jude says, \"kept . . . their first estate\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42385\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42385)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42385)\">Rev. 12:6<\/a><\/span>).\nwere given the opportunity to experience mortal life whereby their spirits were clothed in\nbodies of flesh consisting of earthly elements, or as stated in Genesis, made of the dust of the\nearth (see (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23712\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23712)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23712)\">Gen. 2:7<\/a><\/span>).\nThe others who, with their leader, \"kept not their first estate\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30826\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30826)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30826)\">Jude 1:6<\/a><\/span>),\nbecame the devil and his angels and were permanently denied the privilege of mortal\nexistence, which is prerequisite to exaltation and eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nMan's remembrance of his earlier existence was suspended, and man and woman became\nearth tenants with power and dominion over all other creatures as we read in Genesis: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have\ndominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over\nall the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\n<\/p><p>\n\"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female\ncreated he them\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23709\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23709)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23709)\">Gen. 1:26-27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Man's Freedom<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMan enjoys freedom of action and agency of choice, but while free to exercise this volition,\nhe must abide the consequences of his decision. Through trial and error we, like the Master,\nlearn obedience by the things which we suffer. As Paul said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; \n<\/p><p>\n\"And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey\nhim\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24339\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24339)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24339)\">Heb. 5:8-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Mortality, Intermediate Stage&mdash;Between Eternities<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTo the entire human race mortal life is a connecting link or an intermediate state, joining the\ntwo eternities of the measureless past and the eternal future. All men, sons and daughters of\ndivine parents, are on this earth to experience an enlarged sphere of interest and activity in a\nterrestrial world preliminary to entrance into celestial glory.\n<\/p><p>\nWe accept the scriptural account of the creation of man in the image of God.

He never has and never\nwill trammel man's free agency, even though men may disobey his immutable laws and bring\nupon themselves resultant sorrow and condemnation. Though God is omnipotent, he permits\nmany things contrary to his will.

Even so, the atonement of\nChrist is available to all, or as Paul said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed\nupon all men, for that all have sinned: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so\nby the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42788\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42788)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42788)\">Rom. 5:12,18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Atonement by Jesus Christ<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe affirm as a fundamental principle the biblical account of the atonement wrought by Jesus\nChrist, and we accept it in its literal simplicity. We hold further that he was the one and the\nonly one fitted to become the Savior and Redeemer of the world. No other man possessed\npower to hold death in abeyance and to die only as he willed so to do. As it is declared in\nJohn 5:26: \n<\/p><p>\n\"For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28174\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28174)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28174)\">John 5:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd in John 10:17-18: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.\n<\/p><p>\n\"No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.

These several glories are likened unto the sun, the\nmoon, and the stars and were understood and advocated by Paul to the Saints of Corinth as\nfollows: \n<\/p><p>\n\"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and\nthe glory of the terrestrial is another.\n<\/p><p>\n\"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars:\nfor one star differeth from another star in glory.\n<\/p><p>\n\"So also is the resurrection of the dead\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"417\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 417)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(417)\">1 Cor. 15:40-42<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Twelve Apostles<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior selected and ordained twelve men whom he called Apostles, and he commissioned\nthem to preach the gospel to all the world.
