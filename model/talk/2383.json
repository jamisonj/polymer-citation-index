A spirit of reverence filled the warm tropical air. Situated among the carefully mowed grass, acre upon acre, were markers identifying men, mostly young, who in battle gave their lives. As I let my eyes pass name by name along the many colonnades of honor, tears came easily and without embarrassment. As my eyes filled with tears, my heart swelled with pride. I contemplated the high price of liberty and the costly sacrifice many had been called upon to bear.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/behold-thy-mother.p5\" class=\"\">My thoughts turned from those who bravely served and gallantly died.

Can we not appreciate the pangs of loneliness, the yearnings of mother\u2019s heart when hour after hour, alone in her age, she gazes out the window for the loved one who does not visit, the letter the postman does not bring. She listens for the knock that does not sound, the telephone that does not ring, the voice she does not hear.

From the hallway where we stood, she pointed to several elderly women assembled in a peaceful living room. She observed, \u201cThere\u2019s Mrs. Hansen. Her daughter visits her every week, right at 3:00 p.m. on Sunday. To her right is Mrs. Peek. Each Wednesday there is a letter in her hands from her son in New York. It is read, then reread, then saved as a precious piece of treasure. But see Mrs. Carroll; her family never telephones, never writes, never visits. Patiently she justifies this neglect with words which are heard but do not convince or excuse, \u2018They are all so busy.\u2019\u201d Shame on all who thus make of a noble woman \u201cmother forgotten.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/behold-thy-mother.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cHearken unto thy father that begat thee,\u201d wrote Solomon, \u201cand despise not thy mother when she is old.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41517\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41517)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41517)\">Prov. 23:22<\/a><\/span>.)

A famed officer from the Civil War period, Colonel Higgenson, when asked to name the incident of the Civil War that he considered the most remarkable for bravery, said that there was in his regiment a man whom everybody liked, a man who was brave and noble, who was pure in his daily life, absolutely free from dissipations in which most of the other men indulged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/behold-thy-mother.p22\" class=\"\">One night at a champagne supper, when many were becoming intoxicated, someone in jest called for a toast from this young man. Colonel Higgenson said that he arose, pale but with perfect self-control, and declared: \u201cGentlemen, I will give you a toast which you may drink as you will, but which I will drink in water. The toast that I have to give is, \u2018Our mothers.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/behold-thy-mother.p23\" class=\"\">Instantly a strange spell seemed to come over all the tipsy men. They drank the toast in silence. There was no laughter, no more song, and one by one they left the room. The lamp of memory had begun to burn, and the name of \u201cMother\u201d touched every man\u2019s heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/behold-thy-mother.p24\" class=\"\">As a boy, I well remember Sunday School on Mother\u2019s Day. We would hand to each mother present a small potted plant and sit in silent reverie as Melvin Watson, a blind member, would stand by the piano and sing, \u201cThat Wonderful Mother of Mine.\u201d This was the first time I saw a blind man cry. Even today, in memory, I can see the moist tears move from those sightless eyes, then form tiny rivulets and course down his cheeks, falling finally upon the lapel of the suit he had never seen. In boyhood puzzlement I wondered why all of the grown men were silent, why so many handkerchiefs came forth. Now I know. You see, mother was remembered. Each boy, every girl, all fathers and husbands seemed to make a silent pledge: \u201cI will remember that wonderful mother of mine.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/behold-thy-mother.p25\" class=\"\">Some years ago I listened intently as a man well beyond middle age told me of an experience in his family history. The widowed mother who had given birth to him and his brothers and sisters had gone to her eternal and well-earned reward. The family assembled at the home and surrounded the large dining room table. The small metal box in which Mother had kept her earthly treasures was opened reverently. One by one each keepsake was brought forth. There was the wedding certificate from the Salt Lake Temple. \u201cOh, now Mother could be with Dad.\u201d Then there was the deed to the humble home where each child had in turn entered upon the stage of life. The appraised value of the house had little resemblance to the worth Mother had attached to it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/behold-thy-mother.p26\" class=\"\">Then there was discovered a yellowed envelope which bore the marks of time. Carefully the flap was opened and from inside was taken a homemade valentine. Its simple message, in the handwriting of a child, read, \u201cI love you, Mother.\u201d Though she was gone, by what she held sacred, Mother taught yet another lesson. A silence permeated the room, and every member of the family made a pledge not only to remember, but also to honor mother. For them it was not too little and too late, as in the classic poem of Rose Marinoni entitled \u201cAt Sunrise\u201d:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cThey pushed him straight against the wall,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">The firing squad dropped in a row;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And why he stood on tiptoe,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Those men shall never know.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">He wore a smile across his face<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">As he stood primly there,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">The guns straight aiming at his heart,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">The sun upon his hair.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">For he remembered in a flash<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Those days beyond recall,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">When his proud mother took his height<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Against the bedroom wall.\u201d<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/behold-thy-mother.p39\" class=\"\">Now that we have considered \u201cmother remembered,\u201d let us turn to \u201cmother blessed.\u201d For one of the most beautiful and reverent examples, I refer to the holy scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/behold-thy-mother.p40\" class=\"\">In the New Testament of our Lord, perhaps we have no more moving account of \u201cmother blessed\u201d than the tender regard of the Master for the grieving widow at Nain.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/behold-thy-mother.p41\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd it came to pass \u2026 that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/behold-thy-mother.p42\" class=\"\">\u201cNow when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/behold-thy-mother.p43\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/behold-thy-mother.p44\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still.
