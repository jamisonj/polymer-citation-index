A good example of this occurred when He was near Capernaum, and Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, fell down at Jesus\u2019s feet and pleaded with the Lord to come into his house and bless his daughter, who was dying.

As we stay in tune with the needs of the people, we can strengthen them and help them overcome their challenges, so they will remain steadfast in the way which will lead them back to our Heavenly Father\u2019s presence and help them endure to the end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p19\" class=\"\">The gospel of Jesus Christ is about people, not programs. Sometimes, in the haste of fulfilling our Church responsibilities, we spend too much time concentrating on programs, instead of focusing on people, and end up taking their real needs for granted. When things like that happen, we lose the perspective of our callings, neglect people, and prevent them from reaching their divine potential to gain eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p20\" class=\"\">As I was about to have my 12th birthday, my bishop invited me for an interview and taught me how to prepare to receive the Aaronic Priesthood and be ordained a deacon. As the interview was coming to an end, he pulled out a set of forms from his desk and challenged me to fill them out. They were mission call papers. I was astonished. After all, I was only 11. But that bishop had a vision of the future and of the blessings that would be mine if I prepared properly to serve a mission when my time came.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p21\" class=\"\">He showed he really cared about me. He told me the steps I should take to prepare both financially and spiritually to serve the Lord. After that day, he, and then the bishop who was called after him, interviewed me at least twice a year until I was 19 and encouraged me to remain faithful in my preparation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p22\" class=\"\">They kept my missionary forms in the files and mentioned them whenever we had an interview. With my parents\u2019 help and with the encouragement of loving and patient bishops, I served a mission. The mission helped me gain a perspective of the blessings God has in store for all who endure to the end.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p23\" class=\"\">It does not matter whether it is a child, youth, or adult\u2014everyone needs to feel loved. We have been counseled for several years to focus on working with new converts and less-active members.
