Such a position is wholly inconsistent, because the guidance of this Church comes not alone from the written word but also from continuous revelation, and the Lord gives that revelation to the Church through his chosen prophet. It follows, therefore, that those who profess to accept the gospel and who at the same time criticize and refuse to follow the counsel of the prophet are assuming an indefensible position. Such a spirit leads to apostasy. It is not new. It was prevalent in the days of Jesus and in the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/unity.p18\" class=\"\">It is good to remember the great lesson the Savior taught the Nephites on this subject as he began his ministry among them.

Unity comes by following the light from above. It does not come out of the confusions below. While men depend upon their own wisdom and walk in their own way, without the guidance of the Lord they cannot live in unity. Neither can they come to unity by following uninspired men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/unity.p22\" class=\"\">The way to unity is for us to learn the will of the Lord and then to do it. Until this basic principle is understood and observed, there will be no unity and peace on the earth. The power of the Church for good in the world depends upon the extent to which we, the members thereof, observe this principle.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/unity.p23\" class=\"\">The major reason for the world\u2019s troubles today is that men are not seeking to know the will of the Lord and then to do it. Rather do they seek to solve their problems in their own wisdom and in their own way. The Lord, in the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which he revealed as the preface to the book of his commandments, pointed this out and marked it as one of the causes of the calamities which he foresaw coming upon the inhabitants of the earth.

If we will study the word of the Lord as it comes to us through the standard works and through the instructions of the living prophet and not harden our hearts, but humble ourselves and develop a real desire to understand its application to us in our own peculiar circumstances, and then ask the Lord in faith, believing that we shall receive (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"17939\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17939)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17939)\">D&amp;C 18:18<\/a><\/span>), all the while being diligent in keeping the commandments of the Lord, surely the path we should follow will be made known unto us, and we will be able to face the world as a solid unit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/unity.p29\" class=\"\">Surely we need this unity and this strength in this day in which we live.
