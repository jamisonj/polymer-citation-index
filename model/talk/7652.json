He responded: \u201cI believe I was a good stake president. The programs in our stake ran well, and our statistics were above average. But serving in the temple has expanded my vision. If I were called today to serve as a stake president, my primary focus would be on worthiness to receive and honor temple covenants. I would strive to make temple preparation the center of all that we did. I would do a better job of shepherding the Saints to the house of the Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/honorably-hold-a-name-and-standing.p8\" class=\"\">That brief conversation with my friend helped me as a stake president to teach relentlessly about and testify of the eternal importance of temple ordinances, temple covenants, and temple worship.

This essential relationship between the principle of gathering and the building of temples is highlighted in the Book of Mormon:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/honorably-hold-a-name-and-standing.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the day long did ye labor; and behold the number of your sheaves!

The garners are the holy temples. Elder Neal\u00a0A. Maxwell explained: \u201cClearly, when we baptize, our eyes should gaze beyond the baptismal font to the holy temple. The great garner into which the sheaves should be gathered is the holy temple\u201d (in John\u00a0L. Hart, \u201cMake Calling Focus of Your Mission,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News,<\/span> Sept. 17, 1994, 4). This instruction clarifies and emphasizes the importance of sacred temple ordinances and covenants\u2014that the sheaves may not be wasted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/honorably-hold-a-name-and-standing.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cYea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"118014\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 118014)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(118014)\">Alma 26:6<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/honorably-hold-a-name-and-standing.p15\" class=\"\">Elder Dallin\u00a0H. Oaks has explained that in renewing our baptismal covenants by partaking of the emblems of the sacrament, \u201cwe do not witness that we <span class=\"emphasis\">take upon us<\/span> the name of Jesus Christ. [Rather], we witness that we are <span class=\"emphasis\">willing<\/span> to do so.

The fact that we only witness to our willingness suggests that something else must happen before we actually take that sacred name upon us in the [ultimate and] most important sense\u201d (\u201cTaking upon Us the Name of Jesus Christ,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1985, 81).

We pledge to always remember the Savior and to keep His commandments as preparation to participate in the sacred ordinances of the temple and receive the highest blessings available through the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ.
