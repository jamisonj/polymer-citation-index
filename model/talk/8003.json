Neither did He sit in the highest seats of the synagogues.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/christ-the-redeemer.p7\" class=\"\">His preaching was simple, and even though multitudes followed after Him, His ministry always consisted of blessing people one by one.

This miracle was even more noteworthy because they had already declared the young man legally dead and were on the way to bury him.

Martha, Mary, and Lazarus were siblings whom Christ would often visit. When people informed Him that Lazarus was sick, He remained two days before leaving to come to the family. In consoling Martha after her brother\u2019s death, He categorically testified to her, \u201cI am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129432\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129432)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129432)\">John 11:25<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/christ-the-redeemer.p13\" class=\"\">When the Savior asked for the mourners to remove the stone from the sepulchre, Martha timidly whispered to Him, \u201cLord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129433\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129433)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129433)\">John 11:39<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/christ-the-redeemer.p14\" class=\"\">Then Jesus lovingly reminded her, \u201cSaid I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"129434\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129434)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129434)\">John 11:40<\/a><\/span>).

In the Garden of Gethsemane, in utter loneliness, He suffered the most intense agony, bleeding from each pore. In total submission before His Father, He atoned for our sins and also took upon Him our illnesses and afflictions in order to know how to succor us (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"129437\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 129437)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(129437)\">Alma 7:11\u201313<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/christ-the-redeemer.p22\" class=\"\">We are indebted to Him and to our Heavenly Father because His sacrifice blessed everyone, from Adam, the first, to the last of all human beings.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<div class=\"topic\">\n\t\t\t<h2>Condemnation and Crucifixion of the Savior<\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/christ-the-redeemer.p24\" class=\"\">Once His agony in Gethsemane was concluded, He voluntarily gave Himself up to His detractors. Betrayed by one of His own, He was hurriedly condemned, in a manner both unjust and illegal, in a trial both manipulated and incomplete. That same night He was accused of the crime of blasphemy and condemned to death. In their hatred and thirst for vengeance\u2014because He testified to them that He was the Son of God\u2014His enemies plotted for Pilate to condemn Him. To that end, they changed the accusation of blasphemy to sedition so that His death would be by crucifixion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/christ-the-redeemer.p25\" class=\"\">His condemnation among the Romans was even more cruel: their mockings and scorn regarding His spiritual kingdom, the humiliating coronation with a crown of thorns, His painful scourging, and the prolonged agony of His public Crucifixion were all a clear warning for every person who might dare to declare himself or herself His disciple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/christ-the-redeemer.p26\" class=\"\">At each moment of His suffering, the Redeemer of the world showed exceptional self-control.

In the short period of three days, He worked untiringly to organize the immense work of salvation among the dead. Those days became some of the most hope-filled of all for the family of God. During that visit He organized His faithful followers so that they would bear glad tidings of redemption to those who did not in life come to know of the glorious plan or who had rejected it.
