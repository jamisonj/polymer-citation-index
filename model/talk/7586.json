The university sent him to a leadership seminar where student leaders from across the United States gathered in Chicago, Illinois, to be trained and educated. They participated in an initial game outdoors on the college campus so that they could become acquainted with each other. The students were presented with current issues facing today\u2019s youth and were asked to take a position. In response to the issue presented, they were directed to run to several trees in the grassy area marked \u201cstrongly agree,\u201d \u201cpartially agree,\u201d \u201cstrongly disagree,\u201d or \u201cmildly disagree.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/at-all-times-in-all-things-and-in-all-places.p11\" class=\"\">Toward the end of this exercise, the leader asked, \u201cDo you believe in premarital sex?\u201d Without hesitation, this young man ran to the tree marked \u201cstrongly disagree.\u201d To his amazement, he was the only one there! All the other student leaders were laughing and pointing at him and saying, \u201cOh, Jess, you are so funny. We all know you\u2019re not really serious.\u201d At that moment Jess said he knew exactly what he must do and so he loudly declared, \u201cI\u2019m not funny. I\u2019m serious!\u201d There was a stunned silence, and then the group dispersed, leaving Jess standing alone by the tree. He felt out of place and, yes, weird. But he wasn\u2019t weird. He was right. And he was not alone. During the week, many of the student leaders came to him privately and said that they wished they had known years earlier what he knew. Jess later said, \u201cIt was easy because I knew that I represented not only the university but my family, the Church, and the Savior.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/at-all-times-in-all-things-and-in-all-places.p12\" class=\"\">A testimony that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer made Jess firm and quick to respond.

Several years ago, I had the opportunity to run the Boston Marathon. I had trained hard and felt I was prepared, but at mile 20 there are hills. The locals call the steepest and longest hill Heartbreak Hill. When I reached that point, I was physically spent. The hill was long, and because I was a novice, I allowed myself to do something no seasoned runner ever does\u2014I started to think negatively. This slowed my pace, so I tried to think positively and visualize the finish line. But as I did this, I suddenly realized that I was in a big city, there were thousands of people lining the route, and I had not made any arrangements to locate my husband at the end of the marathon. I felt lost and alone, and I started to cry. I was wearing a big red T-shirt with the word <span class=\"emphasis\">Utah<\/span> printed on the front in big block letters. As the spectators saw that I was crying, they would yell, \u201cKeep going, Utah.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Utah.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re almost finished, Utah.\u201d But I knew I wasn\u2019t, and I was lost.

I told Him that I was discouraged and afraid and that I felt lost. I asked for help and strength to be steadfast and to finish the race.
