The desires we act on determine our changing, our achieving, and our becoming.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/desire.p7\" class=\"\">First I speak of some common desires. As mortal beings we have some basic physical needs. Desires to satisfy these needs compel our choices and determine our actions. Three examples will demonstrate how we sometimes override these desires with other desires that we consider more important.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/desire.p8\" class=\"\">First, food. We have a basic need for food, but for a time that desire can be overridden by a stronger desire to fast.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/desire.p9\" class=\"\">Second, shelter. As a 12-year-old boy I resisted a desire for shelter because of my greater desire to fulfill a Boy Scout requirement to spend a night in the woods. I was one of several boys who left comfortable tents and found a way to construct a shelter and make a primitive bed from the natural materials we could find.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/desire.p10\" class=\"\">Third, sleep. Even this basic desire can be temporarily overridden by an even more important desire. As a young soldier in the Utah National Guard, I learned an example of this from a combat-seasoned officer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/desire.p11\" class=\"\">In the early months of the Korean War, a Richfield Utah National Guard field artillery battery was called into active service. This battery, commanded by Captain Ray Cox, consisted of about 40 Mormon men. After additional training and reinforcement by reservists from elsewhere, they were sent to Korea, where they experienced some of the fiercest combat of that war. In one battle they had to repel a direct assault by hundreds of enemy infantry, the kind of attack that overran and destroyed other field artillery batteries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/desire.p12\" class=\"\">What does this have to do with overcoming the desire for sleep? During one critical night, when enemy infantry had poured through the front lines and into the rear areas occupied by the artillery, the captain had the field telephone lines wired into his tent and ordered his numerous perimeter guards to phone him personally each hour on the hour all night long. This kept the guards awake, but it also meant that Captain Cox had scores of interruptions to his sleep. \u201cHow could you do that?\u201d I asked him. His answer shows the power of an overriding desire.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/desire.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cI knew that if we ever got home, I would be meeting the parents of those boys on the streets in our small town, and I didn\u2019t want to face any of them if their son didn\u2019t make it home because of anything I failed to do as his commander.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09605_000_019\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Ray Cox, interview by author, Aug. 1, 1985, Mount Pleasant, Utah, confirming what he told me in Provo, Utah, circa 1953.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/05\/desire.p14\" class=\"\">What an example of the power of an overriding desire on priorities and on actions!

Understanding this as a vision of his future son and an assurance that he could still live, Ralston summoned the courage and took drastic action to save his life before his strength ran out. He broke the two bones in his trapped right arm and then used the knife in his multitool to cut off that arm.
