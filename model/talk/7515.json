I have felt the guiding influence of the Holy Ghost from the time when I was only 14 years old, when I first listened to the missionaries and read the Book of Mormon.

No matter what our individual circumstances are, we all have the opportunity to edify and nurture others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p17\" class=\"\">I have lived in many countries in Central and South America and in the Caribbean and Spain. I have seen visiting teaching done faithfully by walking short and long distances or by riding buses, subways, or trains. My friend Ana was a young mother in Costa Rica who faithfully did her visiting teaching every month, walking many times in heavy rain. Thirty years later, now a grandmother, she continues to be a faithful visiting teacher.

If we listen to the promptings of the Spirit, we will increase our awareness of other people\u2019s needs. If we act according to those divine promptings, we can be a blessing to those in need. But we have to be willing to give\u2014of our substance and our time. The true measure of our life is not how much we get but how much we give. Visiting teaching provides opportunities to give as we attend to the physical, spiritual, and emotional needs of each other.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p19\" class=\"\">While living in the Dominican Republic, I went to visit a sister who had just gotten home from the hospital after giving birth to her third child.

After a few minutes into our conversation, she shared with me how peaceful she felt because the Relief Society sisters had signed up to come to help her every day for the next few days. She felt loved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p20\" class=\"\">My visiting teachers were always the first to come to see me and bring meals after I got home with each of my newborn babies, in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p21\" class=\"\">President Boyd K.

My companion was a good friend of mine, but we always seemed to have conflicting schedules. That morning I decided to just make the calls to our sisters, schedule a time, and hope that it would work with my companion\u2019s schedule. Unfortunately, my companion was unable to make it. I asked a couple of my roommates to join me for those visits, but no one was available. Knowing that doing my visiting teaching alone wasn\u2019t ideal, I thought about calling to cancel but decided it was better to make visits by myself than let another month slip by without visiting our sisters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cI arrived at Alejandra\u2019s home and nervously approached her door, not knowing if I would recognize her. She had been very friendly on the phone, so I imagined it was a sister I had seen at church. Alejandra greeted me with a warm hug and a big smile. It was a new face! During our conversation, Alejandra shared her desire to start going to church again and said she had been hoping for some kind of visit for the past few months. She stated that this was the first time she had ever received a visiting teacher. We talked about some gospel principles and shared our impressions of that month\u2019s Visiting Teaching Message. She committed to going to church that week. Sure enough, she did (she even brought her boyfriend)!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/feed-my-sheep.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cSince then, Alejandra and I have become good friends.
