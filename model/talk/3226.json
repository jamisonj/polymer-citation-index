We are grateful to all who have taken part in any way. My heart has rejoiced, and my thoughts have been inspired to turn to many things, as what has been said and sung has deeply touched me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/let-us-move-forward-and-upward.p4\" class=\"\">Now, my brothers and sisters, it seems clear to me, indeed, this impression weighs upon me\u2014that the Church is at a point in its growth and maturity when we are at last ready to move forward in a major way. Some decisions have been made and others pending, which will clear the way, organizationally. But the basic decisions needed for us to move forward, as a people, must be made by the individual members of the Church. The major strides which must be made by the Church will follow upon the major strides to be made by us as individuals.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/let-us-move-forward-and-upward.p5\" class=\"\">We have paused on some plateaus long enough. Let us resume our journey forward and upward. Let us quietly put an end to our reluctance to reach out to others\u2014whether in our own families, wards, or neighborhoods. We have been diverted, at times, from fundamentals on which we must now focus in order to move forward as a person or as a people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/let-us-move-forward-and-upward.p6\" class=\"\">Seemingly small efforts in the life of each member could do so much to move the Church forward as never before. Think, brothers and sisters, what would happen if each active family were to bring another family or individual into the Church before next April conference: We would be joined by several hundred thousand new members of the Church. Imagine, if only one additional mature couple were to be called on a full-time mission from each ward\u2014our missionary force would go from 27,500 to over 40,000! Contemplate the results if each family were to assist\u2014between now and next April conference\u2014an inactive family or individual into full activity. How we would revel in the association of those tens of thousands!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/let-us-move-forward-and-upward.p7\" class=\"\">Think of the blessings here and on the other side of the veil if each holder of a temple recommend were to do just one more endowment this next year! And how would our nonmember neighbors and friends feel if we were each to do just one more quiet act of Christian service for them before October conference\u2014regardless of whether or not they are interested in the Church!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/let-us-move-forward-and-upward.p8\" class=\"\">Imagine how much richer our family life would be if our spouses and children were to receive a few more minutes of individual attention each month!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/let-us-move-forward-and-upward.p9\" class=\"\">Are we ready, brothers and sisters, to do these seemingly small things out of which great blessings will proceed? I think we are. I believe the Lord\u2019s church is on the verge of an upsurge in spirituality. Our individual spiritual growth is the key to major numerical growth in the kingdom. The Church is ready to accomplish these things now which it could not have done just a few years ago. So also we are ready as members. If you will accept my counsel, you will come to feel that there is a readiness in our people which must be put to work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/let-us-move-forward-and-upward.p10\" class=\"\">Let us not shrink from the next steps in our spiritual growth, brothers and sisters, by holding back, or side-stepping our fresh opportunities for service to our families and our fellowmen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/let-us-move-forward-and-upward.p11\" class=\"\">Let us trust the Lord and take the next steps in our individual lives.

It is time for us all to take those seemingly small steps forward which will, when compounded, mean major progress for the Church!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/let-us-move-forward-and-upward.p15\" class=\"\">The monumental challenge we face is to provide trained leadership for our fast-growing membership and to help that membership to keep clean from the world in which we must live.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/let-us-move-forward-and-upward.p16\" class=\"\">The encroachment of the world into our lives is threatening.

However, church programs should always support and never detract from gospel-centered family activities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/let-us-move-forward-and-upward.p21\" class=\"\">Members should achieve personal and family preparedness, assisting and strengthening their own family members and others temporally and spiritually in the Lord\u2019s way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/let-us-move-forward-and-upward.p22\" class=\"\">All should work together to make home a place where we love to be, a place of listening and learning, a place where each member can find mutual love, support, appreciation, and encouragement.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/let-us-move-forward-and-upward.p23\" class=\"\">Let us \u201cbe of good cheer\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17241\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17241)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17241)\">D&amp;C 78:18<\/a><\/span>), for the Lord will, as he has promised, lead us along and show us the way.
