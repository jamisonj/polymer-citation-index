It is part of our condition as mortal beings to sometimes feel as though we are surrounded by darkness. We might have lost a loved one; a child might have strayed; we might have received a troubling medical diagnosis; we might have employment challenges and be burdened by doubts or fears; or we might feel alone or unloved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/the-hope-of-gods-light.p9\" class=\"\">But even though we may feel lost in the midst of our current circumstances, God promises the hope of His light\u2014He promises to illuminate the way before us and show us the way out of darkness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>A Room Filled with Darkness<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/the-hope-of-gods-light.p11\" class=\"\">I\u2019d like to tell you about a woman who grew up in a room filled with darkness\u2014I\u2019ll call her Jane.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"story\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/the-hope-of-gods-light.p12\" class=\"\">From the time Jane was three years old, she was repeatedly beaten, belittled, and abused. She was threatened and mocked. She awoke each morning not knowing if she would survive until the next day. The people who should have protected her were those who tortured her or allowed the abuse to continue.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/the-hope-of-gods-light.p13\" class=\"\">In order to protect herself, Jane learned to stop feeling. She had no hope of rescue, so she hardened herself to the horror of her reality. There was no light in her world, so she became resigned to the darkness. With a numbness that can come only from constant and unrelenting contact with evil, she accepted the fact that any moment might be her last.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/the-hope-of-gods-light.p14\" class=\"\">Then, at age 18, Jane discovered The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The joy and hope of the restored gospel penetrated her heart, and she accepted the invitation to be baptized. For the first time, light entered her life, and she saw a bright path before her. She left the darkness of her world and decided to attend school a great distance away from her abuser. At last she felt liberated from an environment of darkness and evil\u2014free to enjoy the Savior\u2019s sweet peace and miraculous healing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/the-hope-of-gods-light.p15\" class=\"\">However, years later, after her abuser had died, Jane was again troubled by the horrible events of her youth. Profound sadness and anger threatened to destroy the wonderful light she had found in the gospel. She realized that if she allowed that darkness to consume her, her tormentor would have a final victory.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/the-hope-of-gods-light.p16\" class=\"\">She sought counseling and medical help and began to realize that, for her, the best path for healing was to understand and accept that darkness exists\u2014but not to dwell there. For, as she now knew, light also exists\u2014and that is where she chose to dwell.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/the-hope-of-gods-light.p17\" class=\"\">Given her dark past, Jane could easily have become vindictive, venomous, or violent. But she didn\u2019t. She resisted the temptation to spread the darkness, refusing to lash out in anger, hurt, or cynicism. Instead, she held fast to the hope that with God\u2019s help she could be healed. She chose to radiate light and devote her life to helping others. This decision enabled her to leave the past behind and to step into a glorious, bright future.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/the-hope-of-gods-light.p18\" class=\"\">She became a schoolteacher, and today, decades later, her love has influenced the lives of hundreds of children, helping them to know that they have worth, that they are important. She has become a tireless defender of the weak, the victimized, and the discouraged. She builds, strengthens, and inspires everyone around her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/the-hope-of-gods-light.p19\" class=\"\">Jane learned that healing comes when we move away from the darkness and walk toward the hope of a brighter light. It was in the practical application of faith, hope, and charity that she not only transformed her own life but forever blessed the lives of many, many others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Light Cleaveth unto Light<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2013\/05\/the-hope-of-gods-light.p21\" class=\"\">There may be some among you who feel darkness encroaching upon you.
