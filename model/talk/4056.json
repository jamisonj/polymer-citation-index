Latter-day Saint women and girls ten and older filled the Tabernacle and Assembly Hall on Temple Square and gathered in meetinghouses throughout the Church to view the proceedings by satellite telecast. Regions not receiving satellite coverage have access to videotapes of the program. With the theme \u201cStriving Together,\u201d the program included music by the Holladay Utah Region women\u2019s chorus and talks by President Gordon B.

That desire, I am confident, is that each of us shall be lifted to a higher plane of thought and living.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p6\" class=\"\">We were recently honored with visits to the Church Administration Building, on two consecutive days, of Ronald Reagan, President of the United States, and Walter Mondale, who is campaigning for the presidency. It was my opportunity on these occasions to introduce each of these distinguished gentlemen to Sister Young, to Sister Kapp, and to Sister Winder. In each instance I indicated that Sister Young presides over an organization of more than 650,000 children, that Sister Kapp presides over an organization of more than a quarter of a million young women, and that Sister Winder presides over an organization of more than a million and a half mature women\u2014the oldest continuously operating organization of women in our nation, if not in the entire world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p7\" class=\"\">I also introduced these gentlemen to the members of the Council of the Twelve and to the Presiding Bishop. We all sat together, men and women, officers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, meeting in the council room of the First Presidency.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p8\" class=\"\">Women in the Church are associates with their brethren in carrying forward this mighty work of the Lord.

Nothing could be further from the truth. The very presence of these three capable women in those meetings with General Authorities and candidates for the presidency of the United States was an indication that under the plan of the Lord women carry tremendous responsibilities and they are accountable for the fulfillment of those responsibilities. They head their own organizations, and those organizations are strong and viable and are significant forces for good in the world. They stand in an associate role to the priesthood, all striving together to build the kingdom of God in the earth. We honor and respect you for your capacity. We expect leadership, and strength, and impressive results from your management of the organizations for which you are responsible. We uphold and sustain you as daughters of God, working in a great partnership to assist him in bringing to pass the immortality and the eternal life of all of the sons and daughters of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p10\" class=\"\">You, my beloved associates, are where you are in the balance of the sexes because God your Eternal Father, who loves you, put you there.

We are honored to be associated with you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p11\" class=\"\">I have been interested in the theme which has been selected for this meeting. It comes from the first chapter of the Epistle of Paul to the Philippians, and reads, \u201cStand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41304\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41304)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41304)\">Philip. 1:27<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p12\" class=\"\">Those are the last words of the twenty-seventh verse. The opening words of that same verse are equally challenging: \u201cLet your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cLet your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ.\u201d That is a tremendously compelling injunction given to each of us. I recommend those words as a personal motto. May I suggest that you type or write them and put them on the mirror before you so that each day you might be reminded of them. They could become a powerful motivator in restraining from anger, in thinking better thoughts, in speaking more elevating language.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p14\" class=\"\">As I have wondered and prayed about what I might say on this occasion, I have been led again to read the twenty-fifth section of the Doctrine and Covenants. This, as you know, is a revelation given through Joseph the Prophet to his wife Emma. It was given at Harmony, Pennsylvania, in July of 1830, only a short time after the Church was organized. Insofar as I know, this is the only revelation given specifically to a woman, and in concluding it the Lord said, \u201cThis is my voice unto all.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18104\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18104)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18104)\">D&amp;C 25:16<\/a><\/span>.) Therefore, the counsel given by the Lord on this occasion is applicable to each of you. It includes you girls of ten and eleven years of age. I am grateful that you are with us tonight. I thank you for the effort you have made to come here. Many of you are here with your mothers, and that is a wonderful thing, for there is nothing more beautiful, no picture more lovely, than that of a mother with her daughters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p15\" class=\"\">A woman wrote to me a short time ago with a great sense of frustration. She indicated that she had been defeated or had failed in most of what she had tried to do. She then asked, \u201cWhat does God expect of me?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p16\" class=\"\">Some of the things which God expects of her and of every other woman\u2014in fact, of each of us\u2014are set forth in this beautiful revelation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p17\" class=\"\">Said he to Emma, and to each of us:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cA revelation I give unto you concerning my will; and if thou art faithful and walk in the paths of virtue before me, I will preserve thy life, and thou shalt receive an inheritance in Zion.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18091\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18091)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18091)\">D&amp;C 25:2<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cIf thou art faithful and walk in the paths of virtue before me\u201d\u2014those words might become the theme of a very long sermon. I shall comment only briefly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p20\" class=\"\">In very large measure each of us holds the key to the blessings of the Almighty upon us. If we wish the blessing, we must pay the price. A part of that price lies in being faithful. Faithful to what? Faithful to ourselves, to the very best that is within us. No woman can afford to demean herself, to belittle herself, to downgrade her abilities or her capacities. Let each be faithful to the great, divine attributes that are within her. Be faithful to the gospel. Be faithful to the Church. We have all about us those who are seeking to undermine it, to look for weaknesses in its early leaders, to find fault with its programs, to speak critically of it. I give you my testimony that it is the work of God, and those who speak against it are speaking against him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p21\" class=\"\">Be faithful to him. He is the one true source of your strength. He is your Father in Heaven. He lives. He hears and answers prayers. Be faithful to God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p22\" class=\"\">The Lord continued, saying to Emma, \u201cIf thou \u2026 walk in the paths of virtue.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18092\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18092)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18092)\">D&amp;C 25:2<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p23\" class=\"\">I think every woman in these gatherings tonight understands the meaning of that. I feel those words were given to Emma Smith, and consequently to all of us, as a condition to be observed if we are to receive an inheritance in the kingdom of God. Lack of virtue is totally inconsistent with obedience to the commandments of God. There is nothing more beautiful than virtue. There is no strength that is greater than the strength of virtue. There is no other nobility equal to the nobility of virtue. There is no quality so becoming, no attire so attractive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p24\" class=\"\">It is interesting that in this revelation, when the Lord gave that great conditional promise to Emma, he went on to say, \u201cThy sins are forgiven thee, and thou art an elect lady.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18093\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18093)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18093)\">D&amp;C 25:3<\/a><\/span>.) I am so grateful for the gift of forgiveness extended by a merciful Father. Said the Lord through the prophet Isaiah concerning those who repent and are forgiven, \u201cThough your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25593\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25593)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25593)\">Isa. 1:18<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p25\" class=\"\">To any within the sound of my voice who may be grieving over serious mistakes in their lives, I hold out the assurance, given anciently and in modern revelation, that where there is repentance there may be forgiveness. Do not dwell upon the tragic mistakes of the past. Rather, \u201clook to God and live.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9438\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9438)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9438)\">Alma 37:47<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p26\" class=\"\">Emma was called \u201can elect lady.\u201d That is, to use another line of scripture, she was a \u201cchosen vessel of the Lord.\u201d (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"38484\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38484)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38484)\">Moro. 7:31<\/a><\/span>.) Each of you is an elect lady. You have come out of the world as partakers of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. You have made your election, and if you are living worthy of it, the Lord will honor you in it and magnify you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p27\" class=\"\">He then went on to say to Emma, \u201cMurmur not because of the things which thou hast not seen.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18094\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18094)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18094)\">D&amp;C 25:4<\/a><\/span>.) He was speaking of the plates which her husband was translating, she serving at the time as his scribe. Evidently she complained because Joseph would not show them to her. The Lord is saying to her, \u201cMurmur not. Complain not. Accept what must be in my eternal wisdom, and do not find fault.\u201d There are a few women in the Church who complain because they do not hold the priesthood. I think the Lord would say to you, \u201cmurmur not because of the things which are not given thee.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p28\" class=\"\">This is his work. Joseph did not set the rule about not showing the plates to others. He was instructed concerning it. Nor have we set the rule concerning those who should receive the priesthood. That was established by him whose work this is, and he alone could change it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p29\" class=\"\">Emma was called, in the words of this revelation, to be \u201ca comfort unto my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., thy husband, in his afflictions, with consoling words, in the spirit of meekness.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18095\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18095)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18095)\">D&amp;C 25:5<\/a><\/span>.)

She was to comfort with consoling words, given in a spirit of meekness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/if-thou-art-faithful.p30\" class=\"\">I see in that the challenge to every woman who is a wife to set the tone of that which is spoken in the home.
