They asked for assistance in helping their children find their way in a world that seems to be unraveling.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p4\" class=\"\">We all hear and read a great deal these days about our polluted physical environment\u2014acid rain, smog, toxic wastes. But these parents recognize that there is another kind of pollution that is much more dangerous\u2014the moral and spiritual.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p5\" class=\"\">In a recent conference, Elder Boyd K. Packer said, \u201cAs we test the <span class=\"emphasis\">moral<\/span> environment, we find the <span class=\"emphasis\">pollution<\/span> index is spiraling upward\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1992, p. 66). The Apostle Paul foresaw \u201cthat in the last days perilous times shall come\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5279\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5279)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5279)\">2 Tim. 3:1<\/a><\/span>). And speaking of the last days, the prophet Moroni declared, \u201cYea, it shall come in a day when there shall be great pollutions upon the face of the earth\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38110\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38110)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38110)\">Morm. 8:31<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p6\" class=\"\">Sadly, the effects of this great pollution are perhaps most evident in the mass media, films, television, and popular music. Of this, Senator Robert D. Byrd said, \u201cIf we in this nation continue to sow the images of murder, violence, drug abuse, \u2026 perversion, [and] pornography \u2026 before the eyes of millions of children, year after year and day after day, we should not be surprised if the foundations of our society rot away as if from leprosy\u201d (Michael Medved, <span class=\"emphasis\">Hollywood vs. America,<\/span> New York: Harper Perennial, 1992, p. 194).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p7\" class=\"\">Although there are some uplifting exceptions, in most areas of the mass media there seems to be a declaration of war against almost everything the majority treasures most: the family, religion, and patriotism. Marriage is degraded, while premarital and extramarital relations are encouraged and glamorized. Profanity and the foulest of vulgar gutter language bombard the ears of all who listen. Reportedly, in one R-rated movie, the most common, vulgar four-letter word was spoken 256 times! Human life itself is trivialized by the constant barrage of violence and killings. Remember that anything that is not good for children is rarely good for adults.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p8\" class=\"\">In an unsuccessful effort to ward off teen pregnancy and social disease, birth control devices are freely distributed. I am convinced that this practice strongly communicates the basic message to many youth that \u201canything goes; just protect yourself in the process.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p9\" class=\"\">It is no wonder that young parents become very anxious as they attempt to fulfill their sacred trust in the face of such an onslaught of despicable influences. Unfortunately, these challenges confront members of the Church as well as nonmembers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p10\" class=\"\">Parents who really want to receive assistance must return to the basics\u2014the fundamentals of the gospel. Among all that could be said, here are four specific suggestions that, if applied, can make a positive difference:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p11\" class=\"\">First, <span class=\"emphasis\">do not be afraid to set clear moral standards and guidelines.<\/span> Be sure to say no when it is needed. As Dr. John Rosemond counseled:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p12\" class=\"\">\u201c[Give] your children regular, daily doses of Vitamin N. This vital nutrient consists simply of the most character-building two-letter word in the English language [<span class=\"emphasis\">No<\/span>]. \u2026 Unfortunately, many, if not most, of today\u2019s children suffer from Vitamin N deficiency. They\u2019ve been overindulged by well-meaning parents who\u2019ve given them far too much of what they want and far too little of what they truly need\u201d (John K. Rosemond, <span class=\"emphasis\">John Rosemond\u2019s Six-Point Plan for Raising Happy, Healthy Children,<\/span> Kansas City, Mo.: Andrews &amp; McMeel, 1989, p. 114).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p13\" class=\"\">Even though your children say, \u201cWell, everyone else is going to stay out until one or two in the morning, and their parents don\u2019t care. Why can\u2019t I? Don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d let them know that there are some things that, as members of your family, you simply do not do. Some parents seem to be almost pathologically concerned about their children\u2019s popularity and social acceptance and go along with many things that are really against their better judgment, such as expensive fads, immodest clothes, late hours, dating before age sixteen, R-rated movies, and so on. For children and parents, standing up for what is right may be lonely at times. There may be evenings alone, parties missed, and movies which go unseen. It may not always be fun. But parenting is not a popularity contest.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p14\" class=\"\">You may need to get together with the parents of your children\u2019s friends and mutually agree on more acceptable high standards of entertainment, hours, and activities. Your children may be frustrated at first, but in the end they will grow to appreciate you even more because you cared enough about them to set some wholesome guidelines and standards.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p15\" class=\"\">Second, <span class=\"emphasis\">teach your children to work and to take responsibility. <\/span>Especially in urban settings, too many children are growing up in an environment where they do not have enough to do. They are like the young thirteen-year-old boy who was asked what he did all day in the summer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p16\" class=\"\">He said, \u201cWell, I get up in the morning about ten or eleven. Then my mom gets me something to eat. Then maybe, I\u2019ll go with some of the guys and play a little basketball, maybe watch TV, and then go down to the mall and \u2018hang out\u2019 for a while\u2014sorta watch the girls and stuff.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p17\" class=\"\">When asked what time he got to bed, he said, \u201cOh, usually about one or two o\u2019clock. I go over to a friend\u2019s house and watch some videos. It\u2019s really neat, because my friend\u2019s mom told the guy at the video shop that it was all right for her son to check out any video he wanted\u2014including R-rated.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p18\" class=\"\">I feel great concern for the future of that young Latter-day Saint boy as well as for that of his friends.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p19\" class=\"\">I like what President Spencer W.

I am reminded of the story of the salesman who came to a house one hot summer day. Through the screen door he could see a young boy practicing his scales on the piano. His baseball glove and hat were by the side of the piano bench. He said, \u201cSay, boy, is your mother home?\u201d To which the boy replied, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Thank heavens for conscientious parents!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p28\" class=\"\">Every child should be helped to develop some skill or talent by which he or she can experience success and thus build self-esteem.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/11\/rearing-children-in-a-polluted-environment.p29\" class=\"\">Missionaries who have learned to work hard and have developed self-discipline are much more successful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"preamble\">Third, <span class=\"emphasis\">create an environment in your family in which spiritual experiences can occur.<\/span> For example:<\/p>\n    <ul class=\"bullet\"><li>\n\t<span class=\"label\">\u2022<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Remember family prayer every day.

This is a wonderful time to share your testimony with your children. Give them an opportunity to share their feelings about the gospel.
