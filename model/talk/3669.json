The objective of these meetings has been to inspire the members to obtain their own temple blessings, attend the temple in behalf of their deceased relatives and others, complete their four-generation records, extend research on family lines, and organize and strengthen the family organizations.

They are invited to bring their families into our home. As a part of the lesson of each of these family home evenings, I have tried to tell them about one of their progenitors. The oldest in the line I can remember is my grandfather, Henry Morgan Perry. As I prepared to give a lesson on his life, I became very excited about his accomplishments.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/let-us-go-up-to-the-house-of-god.p10\" class=\"\">My father once wrote this tribute to his father:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/let-us-go-up-to-the-house-of-god.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cFather was a conservative. He never went into debt. When we didn\u2019t have it, we went without. He never mortgaged the farm. He was very reluctant to impose anything on his homestead. I\u2019ve often heard him say that the only people who had their financial heads above water were the ones who hadn\u2019t mortgaged their farms. He was a public-spirited man. I remember four important positions he held. First was justice of the peace; second, school trustee; third, a member of a bishopric; and fourth, his work on the Great Feeder Canal. He was a pioneer in the development of irrigation in the fertile Snake River Valley.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/let-us-go-up-to-the-house-of-god.p12\" class=\"\">Dad\u2019s account describes the tenderness with which grandfather taught his family. My father was one who desired an education and was earnestly seeking to get the best he could with the means available to him. When his father would see him struggling, he would give him fatherly lectures like, \u201cMy boy, be humble in your studies, and remember your prayers. Yes, and in your prayers, remember your studies.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/let-us-go-up-to-the-house-of-god.p13\" class=\"\">Then dad tells of the time he became a little arrogant as he acquired a little knowledge. One day he challenged his father to a debate to be held after their church service. The subject was: \u201cResolved: That science has done more for the welfare of the human family than has religion.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/let-us-go-up-to-the-house-of-god.p14\" class=\"\">The whole congregation stayed after to listen to the debate. Each speaker was allowed fifteen minutes with a rebuttal of three minutes. My father spoke first. He spoke of the progress science had made and how it had lifted up the standard of living of all. Then he stated how many failures religion had had in the past. Dad was a member of the debating society at school and was gifted in speech. He knew how to sway an audience. When he sat down, he thought he had convinced the people to throw away their Bibles and take up science.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/let-us-go-up-to-the-house-of-god.p15\" class=\"\">Then grandfather got up. He had never had the privilege of having much schooling, but was an avid reader. He told how religions, many of them, had influenced the human family for good. He explained their merits, their excellence, and their worth. Then he sat down.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/let-us-go-up-to-the-house-of-god.p16\" class=\"\">My father got up for rebuttal. He spent most of his time saying, \u201cI have proven. I have proven.\u201d But each \u201cI have proven\u201d seemed to be a little less forceful as he thought of the sincerity of his father\u2019s message. Realizing this, he sat down.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/let-us-go-up-to-the-house-of-god.p17\" class=\"\">Then grandfather arose. He didn\u2019t say much. He just added this: \u201cI give all credit to science for what science has done. It has changed our way of life and, in a way, our thinking. It has built, encircled, and constructed. None of us want to go back to yesterday when today holds so much, and tomorrow even more. But with all of the credit to its progress, and all of the glory to its accomplishments, your scientists have not yet come up with anything that compares with the tenderness of a human heart.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/let-us-go-up-to-the-house-of-god.p18\" class=\"\">Grandfather had won the debate. Even dad was convinced. He rushed over and threw his arms around him and congratulated him. Grandfather then said to dad, \u201cMy boy, remember this: There is more satisfaction in the humble teachings of the Master than all the glamour of a false ideal.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cThey Came,\u201d<\/span> Albert Z.

Henry Morgan and Fannie Young Perry were blessed with 10 children, then 48 grandchildren, 161 great-grandchildren, 241 great-great-grandchildren, and now 22 great-great-great-grandchildren, a total of 482. Including their companions, their number reaches 639. Why, their posterity is a ward almost ready for division!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/let-us-go-up-to-the-house-of-god.p21\" class=\"\">But in becoming acquainted, I\u2019ve found that not all of the family have been blessed with a knowledge of the teachings of their grandfather. Not all have embraced the gospel. Suddenly I realized that I had a great work to do. Some of those 639 will not be part of his eternal family unit because they have not received the witness in their hearts of what they have to do to accomplish this.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/let-us-go-up-to-the-house-of-god.p22\" class=\"\">I have discovered that certainly if there was a man qualified to inherit the celestial kingdom, it would have been my grandfather, Henry Morgan Perry. I am excited as I anticipate being with him in the eternities if I qualify myself. But then I start worrying about meeting grandfather and wondering how he will greet me. The realization comes to me again of the great work I have to accomplish. Because of this concern, I have researched the names of all the descendants of Henry Morgan Perry who have not taken advantage of the glorious privilege of becoming part of an eternal family unit. I have sent them letters inviting them to listen to me today. For the next few minutes I would like to address my remarks to these members of our family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/05\/let-us-go-up-to-the-house-of-god.p23\" class=\"\">The Lord has declared, \u201cFor behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9371\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9371)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9371)\">Alma 34:32<\/a><\/span>.)
