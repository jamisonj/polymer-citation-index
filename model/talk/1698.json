Monson, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1969, pp. 126-129<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nThe vast throng assembled in the Tabernacle this Easter morning is a beautiful sight. I\nrecognize among you those who have traveled great distances to be at the conference&mdash;even\nfrom far-off Australia.\n<\/p><p>\nThe flight from Brisbane, Australia, to San Francisco is a long one. There is time to read,\ntime to sleep, and time to ponder and think.  As a passenger on this flight, I was awakened by\nthe calm, resonant sound of the pilot's voice as he announced: \"Ladies and gentlemen, we're\nnow passing over the Coral Sea, scene of the great sea battle of World War II.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThrough the cabin window I could see billowy white clouds, and far below, the azure blue of\nthe vast Pacific. My thoughts turned to the events of that fateful eighth day of May in 1942\nwhen the mammoth aircraft carrier <i>Lexington<\/i> slipped to its final resting place on the ocean\nfloor. Twenty-seven hundred and thirty-five sailors scrambled to safety.  Others were not so\nfortunate.  One who went down with his ship was my boyhood friend, Arthur Patton.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Story of Arthur Patton<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMay I tell you about Arthur? He had blond, curly hair and a smile as big as all outdoors.\nArthur stood taller than any boy in the class. I suppose this is how he was able to fool the\nrecruiting officers and enlist in the Navy at the tender age of 15. To Arthur and most of the\nboys, the war was a great adventure. I remember how striking he appeared in his navy\nuniform.  How we wished we were older, or at least taller, so we too could enlist.\n<\/p><p>\nYouth is a very special time of life. As Longfellow wrote: \n<\/p><p>\n\"How beautiful is youth! How bright it gleams<br \/>\n     With its illusions, aspirations, dreams!<br \/>\n     Book of Beginnings, Story without End,<br \/>\n     Each maid a heroine, and each man a friend!\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;     (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow \"Moritus Salutamus\")\n<\/p><p>\nArthur's mother was so proud of the blue star that graced her living room window. It\nrepresented to every passerby that her son wore the uniform of his country. When I would\npass the house, she often opened the door and invited me in to read the latest letter from\nArthur.  Her eyes would fill with tears, and I would then be asked to read aloud. Arthur\nmeant everything to his widowed mother.  I can still picture Mrs. Patton's coarse hands a, she\nwould carefully replace the letter in its envelope. These were honest hands that bore the\nworker's seal. Mrs. Patton was a cleaning woman&mdash;a janitress for a downtown office\nbuilding Each day of her life except Sundays she could be seen walking up the sidewalk, pail\nand brush in hand, her gray hair combed in a tight bob, her shoulders weary from work and\nstooped with age.\n<\/p><p>\nThen came the Battle of the Coral Sea, the sinking of the <i>Lexington<\/i>, and the death of Arthur\nPatton. The blue star was taken from its hallowed spot in the front window. It was replaced\nby one of gold. A light went out in the life of Mrs. Patton. She groped in utter darkness and\ndeep despair.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Will Arthur live again?<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWith a prayer in my heart, I approached the familiar walkway to the Patton home, wondering\nwhat words of comfort could come from the lips of a mere boy.\n<\/p><p>\nThe door opened, and Mrs. Patton embraced me as she would her own son.  Home became a\nchapel, as a grief-stricken mother and a less-than-adequate boy knelt in prayer.\n<\/p><p>\nArising from our knees, Mrs. Patton gazed into my eyes and spoke: \"Tom, I belong to no\nchurch, but you do. Tell me, will Arthur live again?\"\n<\/p><p>\nTime dims the memory of that conversation. The present whereabouts of Mrs. Patton is not\nknown to me; but, Mrs. Patton, wherever you are, from the backdrop of my personal\nexperience, I should like to once more answer your question, \"Will Arthur live again?\"\n<\/p><p>\nI suppose we could say that this is a universal question, for who has not at a time of\nbereavement pondered the same thought?\n<\/p><p>\nDeath leaves in its cruel wake shattered dreams, unfulfilled ambitions, crushed hopes. In our\nhelplessness, we turn to others for assurance. Men of letters and leaders of renown can\nexpress their beliefs, but they cannot provide definitive answers.\n<\/p><p>\nThe dim light of belief must yield to the noonday sun of revelation.  We turn backward in\ntime, that we might go forward with hope. Back, back beyond the silent generation, the beat\ngeneration, the lost generation. Back, back beyond the Space Age, the Computer Age, the\nIndustrial Age.  Back, back to him who walked the dusty paths of villages we now reverently\ncall the Holy Land, to him who caused the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the lame to walk,\nand the dead to live, to him who tenderly and lovingly assured us, \"I am the way, the truth,\nand the life\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28536\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28536)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28536)\">John 14:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The plan of life<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe plan of life and an explanation of its eternal course come to us from the Master of\nheaven and earth, even Jesus Christ the Lord. To understand the meaning of death, we must\nappreciate the purpose of life.\n<\/p><p>\nIn this dispensation, the Lord declared: \"And now, verify I say unto you, I was in the\nbeginning with the Father and am the Firstborn\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15420\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15420)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15420)\">D&amp;C 93:21<\/a><\/span>). \"Man was also in the\nbeginning with God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15422\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15422)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15422)\">D&amp;C 93:29<\/a><\/span>).\nJeremiah the prophet recorded, \". . . the word of the Lord\ncame unto me, saying, Before I formed thee . . . I knew thee; and before thou camest forth I\nsanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26524\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26524)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26524)\">Jer. 1:4-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFrom that majestic world of spirits we enter the grand stage of life even to prove ourselves\nobedient to all things commanded of God. During mortality we grow from helpless infancy to\ninquiring childhood and then to reflective maturity. We experience joy and sorrow, fulfillment\nand disappointment, success and failure; taste the sweet, yet sample the bitter.  This is\nmortality.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The experience known as death<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThen to each life comes the experience known as death. None is exempt. All must pass its\nportals. Death claims the aged, the weary and worn. It visits the youth in the bloom of hope\nand glory of expectation. Nor are the little children kept beyond its grasp. In the words of the\napostle Paul: \". . . it is, appointed unto men once to die\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24384\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24384)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24384)\">Heb. 9:27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo most, there is something sinister and mysterious about this unwelcome visitor called death. \nPerhaps it is a fear of the unknown that causes many to dread his coming.\n<\/p><p>\nArthur Patton died quickly. Others linger. Not long ago I held the thin hand of a youth as he\napproached the brink of eternity. \"I know I am dying,\" he said touchingly.  \"What follows\ndeath?\"\n<\/p><p>\nI turned to the scriptures and read to him: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who\ngave it\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21420\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21420)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21420)\">Eccl. 12:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . there is a time appointed unto men that they shall rise from the dead; and there is a\nspace between the time of death and the resurrection. . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection&mdash;Behold . . . the\nspirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body . . . are taken home to\nthat God who gave them life\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9113\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9113)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9113)\">Alma 40:9,11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo me, the lad said, \"Thank you.\" To my Heavenly Father I said silently, \"Thank thee, oh\nGod, for truth.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>God's purposes to be fulfilled<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nMrs. Patton, do not grieve as you think of your boy in the depths of the Pacific or question\nhow God's purposes can be fulfilled. Remember the words of the psalmist: \"If I take the\nwings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; \n<\/p><p>\n\"Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41901\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41901)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41901)\">Ps. 139:9-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod has not forsaken you, Mrs. Patton.  He sent his Only Begotten Son into the world to\nteach us by example the life we should live. His Son died upon the cross to redeem all\nmankind. His words to the grieving Martha and to his disciples today bring comfort to you: \".\n. . I am the resurrection, and the life:  he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall\nhe live: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28526\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28526)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28526)\">John 11:25-26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to\nprepare a place for you.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28533\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28533)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28533)\">John 14:2-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMrs. Patton, the testimonies of John the revelator and Paul the apostle are also significant to\nyou. John recorded: \". . . I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And the sea gave up the dead which were in it\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42439\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42439)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42439)\">Rev. 20:12-13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPaul declared: \". . . as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"508\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 508)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(508)\">1 Cor. 15:22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>We walk by faith<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nUntil the glorious resurrection morning, we walk by faith.  \"For now we see through a glass,\ndarkly; but then face to face\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"496\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 496)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(496)\">1 Cor. 13:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJesus invites you, Mrs. Patton, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I\nwill give you rest.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall\nfind rest unto your souls\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35920\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35920)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35920)\">Matt. 11:28-29<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSuch knowledge will sustain you in your heartache. You will never be in the tragic situation\nof the disbeliever who, having lost a son, was heard to say, as she watched the casket lowered\ninto mother earth, \"Good-bye, my boy. Good-bye forever.\" Rather, with head erect, courage\nundaunted, and faith unwavering, you can lift your eyes as you look beyond the gently\nbreaking waves of the blue Pacific and whisper, \"Good-bye, Arthur, my precious son.\nGood-bye&mdash;until we meet again.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the words of Tennyson may come to you as though spoken by your boy: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Sunset and evening star,<br \/>\n     And one clear call for me!<br \/>\n     And may there be no moaning of the bar,<br \/>\n     When I put out to sea . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"Twilight and evening bell,<br \/>\n     And after that the dark!<br \/>\n     And may there be no sadness of farewell,<br \/>\n     When I embark; \n<\/p><p>\n\"For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place<br \/>\n     The flood may bear me far,<br \/>\n     I hope to see my Pilot face to face<br \/>\n     When I have crossed the bar.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;               &mdash;\"Crossing the Bar\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Mrs. Patton, Arthur lives!<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTo the words of the poet I add the testimony of a witness.  Mrs. Patton, God our Father is\nmindful of you. Through sincere prayer you can communicate with him.  He, too, had a son\nwho died, even Jesus Christ the Lord.  He is our advocate with the Father, the Prince of\nPeace (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25361\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25361)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25361)\">Isa. 9:6<\/a><\/span>),\nour Savior and Divine Redeemer. One day we shall see him face to face.\n<\/p><p>\nIn his blessed name I declare to you the solemn and sacred truth: Oh, Mrs. Patton, Arthur\nlives! In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
