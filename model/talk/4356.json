As our Father and the Savior planned for us to come to earth, they said, \u201cWe will prove them herewith, to see if they [you and I] will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7372\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7372)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7372)\">Abr. 3:25<\/a><\/span>). This was to become a testing ground; we would come to an understanding of good and evil, of happiness and suffering, of joy and pain. We knew the plan. We desired it; we endorsed it. We defended it. We even fought for it!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p7\" class=\"\">With eagerness and excitement, we came to earth to learn\u2014each of us having our own particular set of circumstances with trials and temptations to overcome.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p8\" class=\"\">We were not left without hope. Our Savior, through his atonement, has made it possible for us to obtain salvation. He will not leave us helpless as we struggle to overcome the adversities of this life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p9\" class=\"\">There are so many kinds of challenges: the frustrations and disappointments of disobedient children or a difficult marriage, the loneliness of an empty house when one is so eagerly seeking companionship, the long upward road to repentance, or the difficulty of keeping a positive attitude and counting our blessings even in times of hardship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p10\" class=\"\">The example of the Savior\u2019s life and the teachings that he left us are patterns for us to follow. He faced trials similar to those we experience; he handled each situation in a perfect manner. In the wilderness of Judea and the Garden of Gethsemane, we witness two of the most grievous temptations of Christ, but during no part of his days in the flesh was he free from temptation. Otherwise his life would have been no human life at all. We read in Mosiah, \u201cAnd lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40610\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40610)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40610)\">Mosiah 3:7<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p11\" class=\"\">He knew disappointment, and he knew discouragement, as witnessed by his lament for his people in Jerusalem and their failure to heed his message. \u201cO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, \u2026 how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37140\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37140)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37140)\">Matt. 23:37<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p12\" class=\"\">Which of us has not known disappointment, discouragement, and despair? That is one of the tests for all of us. Consider the Prophet Joseph, as he languished in Liberty Jail in March of 1839, having been there for months, knowing that his people had been driven from their homes and were destitute. His cry is touching: \u201cO God, where art thou? \u2026 How long shall thy hand be stayed?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18511\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18511)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18511)\">D&amp;C 121:1\u20132<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p13\" class=\"\">And then the soothing answer came from a kind and loving Father:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cThine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18512\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18512)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18512)\">D&amp;C 121:7\u20138<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p16\" class=\"\">An then, later, tenderly, \u201cKnow thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18518\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18518)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18518)\">D&amp;C 122:7<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p17\" class=\"\">Most of us have witnessed how living the gospel can change the lives of people in a positive way. As an example of this, I recall a family that we met while in the mission field. The missionaries described the Barnes family as being a wonderful family, but with no evidence at all of Church influence in their lives. The father was rough and crude, a beer-drinking toughie. His children were afraid of him. Their home was far from tidy, and their appearance the same. They had had a hard life. But as the missionaries met with them, a marvelous transformation began taking place. They were impressed with the life and teachings of the Savior and made an effort to apply his teachings in their lives. Their very appearance and outlook on life began to change.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p18\" class=\"\">Learning about unconditional love and not being judgmental gave them a new approach with an adult son who is an alcoholic. Their new attitude, along with professional help, seems to be making a real difference in his life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p19\" class=\"\">Learning to respect themselves as sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father, they threw away their cigarettes, and they stopped drinking. They cleaned themselves up and their surroundings as well. And now there is a loving spirit in their home, where they read the scriptures regularly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p20\" class=\"\">Sister Barnes writes: \u201cAs we read the scriptures, we found that Jesus gave the instruction to \u2018be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee\u2019 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37119\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37119)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37119)\">Matt. 9:2<\/a><\/span>), indicating that as we truly repent and forsake our sins, we may be optimistic about the future.

This change was not unlike changes that have occurred with others. After King Benjamin exhorted his people to live a good life, having hope in Christ, \u201cThey all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord \u2026 , which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40620\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40620)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40620)\">Mosiah 5:2<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p22\" class=\"\">Just as Brother and Sister Barnes felt the Savior\u2019s unconditional love as they studied the gospel and found hope in Christ; and just as the people of King Benjamin found hope in him, so can we find respect for ourselves and others, rid ourselves of self-defeating habits, be nonjudgmental, be optimistic and of good cheer, be assured of his love for us, and find hope in him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/hope-in-christ.p23\" class=\"\">I thrilled as I read the words of a young mother of six who is also an example of one who has overcome.
