McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1953, pp. 58-60<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nWhen President Robertson referred to the freedom we enjoy in this great country, and gave us\na glimpse of barbarism going on in China and other places, these lines came to my mind: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,\n     Who never to himself hath said\n     This is my own, my native land?\"\n<\/p><p>\nLet us thank God every morning, every night, in our family prayers, that we live in the\nUnited States of America, the Constitution of which vouchsafes individual freedom, and let us\npray also, that the Lord will frustrate the plans of the Communists who would deprive us of\nthat freedom.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are in the Tabernacle tonight, 10,432; in the Assembly Hall 2,932; in the Barratt Hall\n1,220; on the grounds 1,792; the Field House at Provo reports 839; making a total of over\n17,000 men of the Priesthood assembled tonight.\n<\/p><p>\nIt has always been my nature to enjoy the company of my associates. I love to be with my\nfriends. The older I grow the more intense becomes my appreciation of fellowship in the\nBrotherhood of Christ. I sense that tonight more deeply, more sincerely than ever before. As I\nhave looked into your faces, partaken of your spirit, as I picture those in the Assembly Hall in\nthe Barratt Hall and on the grounds and down in the Field House, I feel that it is one of the\ngreatest privileges, one of the most inspirational experiences in life to associate with men who\nhold the Holy Priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nI have nothing but blessing in my heart for you. I love you. I like to call you my beloved\nassociates and fellow workers, and that love is akin to the love we have for our wives and our\nchildren, and if we can keep this unity, this confidence, nothing in the world can stop the\nprogress of this work.\n<\/p><p>\nYou note tonight that the theme has largely been missionary. We have called these brethren\nfrom China, Australia, and Switzerland merely illustrative of how wide-spread our Gospel is.\nWe have had them from the Islands, from South Africa. They are calling, calling for\nmissionaries. Within the last few weeks, prominent visitors from India, Indo-China, from\nHong Kong, have extended a cordial invitation to us to come to these places. This is a\nworld-wide religion, brethren. It is the Gospel that must be preached to every nation, kindred,\ntongue and people.\n<\/p><p>\nLet me thank you and those of your families who have sent in checks by the scores, recently,\nwith promises to repeat those checks monthly, to aid local missionaries in spreading the\nGospel. We do not want any missionary in Australia or New Zealand or in any of the\nAmerican nations, or in Mexico to have his or her expenses paid entirely but we will assist\nwhenever possible local missionaries who need supplementary assisting. The response to\nsuggestions of some of the brethren for such missionary funds is surprising and gratifying. As\nfar as possible we let the donors know the names of those to whom this money is sent.\n<\/p><p>\nHow the way opens up for the preaching of the Gospel! The calling of the boys into the\nmilitary service has of course crippled our missionary work, more than it should have done. If\nanybody tells you that members of this Church are not carrying their share in the military\nwork, you may just tell them that they do not know what they are talking\nabout. I just take this opportunity to thank all who are contributing to the missionary cause.\n<\/p><p>\nAnother phase of this missionary work tonight&mdash;Professor James L. Barker for years has urged\nthat we give classes in foreign languages, that our young men may have an opportunity to\nstudy at home and get at least the fundamentals before going to a foreign country. Well, it is\na good suggestion, but we have not yet been able to make it practical. It seems now that the\ntime has come when we must do something. I have here before me an appeal for the teaching\nof languages in our high schools. I have a note from one who says that among all our senior\nhigh schools, only 15 offer one or more courses in foreign languages. In the Church there are\nmen and women from every country in the world, in which there are missionaries. I should\nlike to encourage our young men and young women, young men particularly, to include in\ntheir high school and college courses, some of these languages.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Wilkinson informs me that twelve foreign languages are taught in the\nB.Y.U.&mdash;German, French, Portuguese, Greek, Syrian, Russian, Arabic, Latin, Swedish,\nNorwegian, Finnish, Dutch. In the University of Utah I learn that they have <i>810<\/i> students\nregistered in 12 languages, and so the opportunity is at hand.\n<\/p><p>\nRecently there appeared in a local paper here an excellent editorial on the necessity, on the\nadvisability of teaching languages here in our State, and in the United States. \"Modern\nlanguages are not as widely or as successfully taught in United States schools as they should\nbe to meet the requirements of the nation's position. The high school student who <i>takes<\/i> a\nlanguage often finds he has practically forgotten it within a year or so. That may be due, in\nlarge part, to the fact that there is little opportunity to exercise language skills. The need to\nlearn foreign languages should be accented and the acquisition and use of such languages\nstimulated. When men can talk together, they can get together.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe responsibility of preaching the Gospel rests upon us. When the people in Macedonia\ncalled to Paul, and the spirit told him to go over, he answered that call\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7697\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7697)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7697)\">Acts 16:9-10<\/a><\/span>). They are calling for\nus in various nations they are calling for more missionaries now in the missions already\nestablished, and we must answer that call.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, in conclusion, let me urge more diligence in living the principles of the Gospel. We\nmay preach, we may write, and publish books, but the most effective way of preaching the\nGospel to the nations of the world, is by example.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine,\" said the Savior, \"and doeth them, I will\nliken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And the rain descended, and floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and\nit fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto\na foolish man which built his house upon the sand: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house;\nand it fell: and great was the fall of it\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34567\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34567)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34567)\">Matt. 7:24-27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay God add his blessings to the instructions and the reports given this night, may we depart\nwith greater determination in our hearts to serve the Lord and keep his commandments, may\nwe go forth with greater resolution to defend and keep his commandments, may we go forth\nwith greater resolution to defend one another in righteous living, to defend the Church, not to\nspeak against our neighbors, nor against authorities of the Church, local, stake or general. Let\nus avoid evil speaking, let us avoid slander and gossip. These are poisons to the soul to those\nwho indulge. Evil speaking injures the reviler more than the reviled. I heard a recent convert\nwho came from Europe say, \"I am surprised to hear how many people talk\nagainst the Authorities here in Salt Lake City.\" She was grieved, she had the right ideal of the\nGospel of Jesus Christ, that we should speak well of one another.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, peace be in your hearts peace and harmony be in your homes. God bless every man\nand every woman who has entered the waters of baptism with a testimony of the truth, I bear\nthat testimony to you tonight with all my soul. I know that the power of God rests with his\nservants. I know that he will reveal and does reveal his mind and will to them. The\ncommunications of man's spirit, of one holding the Priesthood, with our Father in Heaven\nthrough the Holy Spirit is real. Is there anything in the world more precious than that\nknowledge! It is more precious than life, because it gives assurance that if death does come,\nthat spirit continues. I bear you that testimony, that communication with our Heavenly Father\nis real, that Jesus Christ, our Lord, stands at the head of this Church. and that he desires the\nmembers so to live that this truth, this Gospel, may be preached in all the world as a witness\nand then the end will come\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34598\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34598)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34598)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWith all my soul I bless you my fellow workers and pray that his inspiration will abide in\nyour hearts and that peace and harmony and love may abide in your homes, in the name of\nJesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
