The divine guidance which has directed the affairs of this Church for over 166 years today, since The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was legally organized on 6 April 1830. What has happened in this work in this relatively short time is a miracle. As a small boy, I remember hearing my great-uncle William Wetzel tell about walking with his family across the American plains to Salt Lake Valley. His stories of struggle, sacrifice, and faith made an indelible impression on my young heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/the-prophetic-voice.p5\" class=\"\">When Great-grandfather\u2019s family arrived in this valley, most of the members of the Church lived in a group of small, dusty settlements in the territory of Deseret. Many had braved the ocean to come to the United States.

The Brethren are those who hold the keys of the kingdom of God on earth.

Millions of men and women have followed the prophets of God.

One man especially, whom I now think of, \u2026 was peculiarly gifted in self-reliance and general ability.

I testify that this revelatory power has directed this work since April 6, 1830. That confirmation is the source of the greatest knowledge I have. I counsel and pray that all will heed the ongoing prophetic voice of this Church, revealing the word of God in our day.
