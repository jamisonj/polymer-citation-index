These are all valued and all necessary, but they do not constitute our full offering to God. Ultimately, what our Father in Heaven will require of us is more than a contribution; it is a total commitment, a complete devotion, all that we are and all that we can be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/standing-as-witnesses-of-god.p4\" class=\"\">Please understand that I do not speak only of a commitment to the Church and its activities, although that always needs to be strengthened. No, I speak more specifically of a commitment that is shown in our individual behavior, in our personal integrity, in our loyalty to home and family and community, as well as to the Church. Of course, all of these loyalties are interrelated and closely linked because it is the teaching and example of the Lord Jesus Christ that shapes our behavior and forms our character in all areas of our life\u2014personally, within the home, in our professions and community life, as well as in our devotion to the Church that bears his name.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/standing-as-witnesses-of-god.p5\" class=\"\">If we can pattern our life after the Master, and take his teachings and example as the supreme pattern for our own, we will not find it difficult to be consistent and loyal in every walk of life, for we will be committed to a single, sacred standard of conduct and belief. Whether at home or in the marketplace, whether at school or long after school is behind us, whether we are acting totally alone or in concert with a host of other people, our course will be clear and our standards will be obvious. We will have determined, as the prophet Alma said, \u201cto stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that [we] may be in, even until death.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40786\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40786)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40786)\">Mosiah 18:9<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/standing-as-witnesses-of-god.p6\" class=\"\">This loyalty obviously includes support of the institutional church, but one of the purposes of that church is to alter and improve the way we live every other aspect of our lives as well, wherever we are and in whatever circumstance we find ourselves, \u201ceven until death.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/standing-as-witnesses-of-god.p7\" class=\"\">Let me recall briefly just one of those magnificent examples from scripture where three relatively young people stood by their principles and held to their integrity even though it seemed apparent that to do so would cost them their lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/05\/standing-as-witnesses-of-god.p8\" class=\"\">Approximately 586 years before Christ, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, marched against the city of Jerusalem and conquered it.
