Many subjects would address the mortal concerns we all share. But just as Jesus did not teach how to overcome the mortal challenges or political oppression of His day, He usually inspires His modern servants to speak about what we must do to reform our personal lives to prepare us to return to our heavenly home. On this Easter weekend I have felt impressed to talk about the precious and timeless teachings in one of the parables of Jesus.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-parable-of-the-sower.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">The parable of the sower is one of a small number of parables reported in all three of the synoptic Gospels.

This is the circumstance of new members who are merely converted to the missionaries or to the many attractive characteristics of the Church or to the many great fruits of Church membership. Not being rooted in the word, they can be scorched and wither away when opposition arises. But even those raised in the Church\u2014long-term members\u2014can slip into a condition where they have no root in themselves. I have known some of these\u2014members without firm and lasting conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ. If we are not rooted in the teachings of the gospel and regular in its practices, any one of us can develop a stony heart, which is stony ground for spiritual seeds.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/saturday-morning-session\/the-parable-of-the-sower.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">Spiritual food is necessary for spiritual survival, especially in a world that is moving away from belief in God and the absolutes of right and wrong.

If the emblems of the sacrament are being passed and you are texting or whispering or playing video games or doing anything else to deny yourself essential spiritual food, you are severing your spiritual roots and moving yourself toward stony ground. You are making yourself vulnerable to withering away when you encounter tribulation like isolation, intimidation, or ridicule.

This limited view focuses on a particular doctrine or practice or perceived deficiency in a leader and ignores the grand panorama of the gospel plan and the personal and communal fruits of its harvest. President Gordon\u00a0B. Hinckley gave a vivid description of one aspect of this keyhole view.

Wherever we are in our spiritual journey\u2014whatever our state of conversion\u2014we are all tempted by this.
