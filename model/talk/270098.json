But He, knowing all things, says, Not so. As much as to say, your\n  views are not correct, the Church is in its infancy, and if you take this rash step, you will destroy the\n  wheat,<span class=\"footRef\">4<\/span> or the Church, with the tares; therefore it is better to let them grow together until the\n  harvest,<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span> or the end of the world, which means the destruction of the wicked,<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> which is not yet\n  fulfilled, as we shall show hereafter, in the Savior&rsquo;s explanation of the parable, which is so plain that\n  there is no room left for dubiety upon the mind, notwithstanding the cry of the priests&mdash;&ldquo;parables,\n  parables!  figures, figures!  mystery, mystery!  all is mystery!&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">7<\/span> But we find no room for doubt here,\n  as the parables were all plainly elucidated.<\/p>\n  <div class=\"topic \">Parable of the Church in Last Days<\/div>\n  <p class=\"std\">And again, another parable put He forth unto them, having an allusion to the Kingdom that\n  should be set up, just previous to or at the time of the harvest, which reads as follows&mdash;&ldquo;The\n  Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field: which\n  indeed is the least of all seeds: but, when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh\n  a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">8<\/span> Now we can discover\n  plainly that this figure is given to represent the Church as it shall come forth<span class=\"footRef\">9<\/span> in the last days.\n  Behold, the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto it. Now, what is like unto it?<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">Let us take the Book of Mormon, which a man took and hid in his field, securing it by his faith,\n  to spring up in the last days, or in due time; let us behold it coming forth out of the ground, which\n  is indeed accounted the least of all seeds, but behold it branching forth, yea, even towering, with\n  lofty branches, and God-like majesty, until it, like the mustard seed, becomes the greatest of all\n  herbs. And it is truth, and it has sprouted and come forth out of the earth,<span class=\"footRef\">10<\/span> and righteousness begins\n  to look down from heaven, and God is sending down His powers, gifts and angels, to lodge in the\n  branches thereof.<\/p>\n  <p class=\"std\">The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a mustard seed.
