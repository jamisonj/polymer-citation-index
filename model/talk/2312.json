The latter (the idle poor) were put on a permanent dole, a welfare system not unlike our own. As this system became permanent, the recipients of public largesse (welfare) increased in number. They organized into a political block with sizable power. They were not hesitant about making their demands known. Nor was the government hesitant about agreeing to their demands \u2026 and with ever-increasing frequency. Would-be emperors catered to them. The great, solid middle class\u2014Rome\u2019s strength then as ours is today\u2014was taxed more and more to support a bureaucracy that kept growing larger, and even more powerful. Surtaxes were imposed upon incomes to meet emergencies. The government engaged in deficit spending. The denarius, a silver coin similar to our half dollar, began to lose its silvery hue. It took on a copper color as the government reduced the silver content.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/07\/watchman-warn-the-wicked.p41\" class=\"\">\u201cEven then, Gresham\u2019s law was at work, because the real silver coin soon disappeared.

Indeed, a foreigner could win Roman citizenship simply by volunteering for service in the legions of Rome. But, with increasing affluence and opulence, the young men of Rome began avoiding this service, finding excuses to remain in the soft and sordid life of the city.
