There are many\nbeliefs, many interpretations, numerous conflicts and much discussion on matters pertaining to\nreligion. I do believe, however, that the best people in our country are interested in preserving\nspirituality in America. No nation can grow permanently great without God. History has so\nproven. The foundation of spirituality is faith in the true and living God. Without such faith\nman is forever in the shadows, for he has lost his greatest incentive to right living.\n<\/p><p>\nOne hopeful feature of the modern times in which we live is a return to the Bible. From\nbeginning to end this sacred volume is a message of faith. It is a powerful testimony of the\nexistence of God, and the divine mission of Jesus Christ. Its religious significance is\nrecognized in all Christian countries. History proves that the Holy Bible has irrevocably\naltered the lives of men and nations. It has touched deeply the very heart of humanity, its\ninfluence has reached into the literature of the world and its passages have been quoted by\npreachers and laymen alike.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe that Biblical research and intensive study of the sacred writing will some day\ncontribute much to the intelligent use of the Bible. Scholarship and honest investigation will\neventually remove all doubt respecting its divine authenticity, its trust-worthiness and\nreliability as a guide to human progress.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is natural for most men to turn to the past for proved wisdom. The Bible contains the\nwisdom of the ages and the demonstrations of God's power to uplift the human family. From\nits pages come a transcendent comfort and a deeper sense of life's purposes. I refer to its\nteachings with the utmost confidence. \"Search the scriptures,\" said Jesus, \"for in them ye think\nye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27684\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27684)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27684)\">John 5:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe greatest advocate and teacher of faith in God is Jesus Christ. During his ministry he\ndemonstrated its power. He taught faith to the unrepentant. He urged those stricken with\ndisease to exercise their faith as a means of receiving the desired blessing. He healed the sick,\nraised up the dying, restored sight to the blind and brought hope and comfort to the\ndistressed.\n<\/p><p>\nThomas Didymus, who was profoundly shaken by the scene at Golgotha, had lost his faith.\nHe had said on one occasion that he was ready to die with his Master. But like the others, he\nran away. He had become sullen, resentful and unbelieving. \". . . Except I shall see in his\nhands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand\ninto his side, I will not believe\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27714\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27714)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27714)\">John 20:25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLike all skeptics he insisted on a material test. He would not believe his eyes. He must feel\nand touch. So-called \"reality\" was his stronghold. But the Master understood the texture of his\nmind. Thomas Didymus must be reassured and strengthened in his faith.\n<\/p><p>\nA week later, the disciples were in the same house as on the first occasion and Thomas was\nwith them. Suddenly the Lord appeared. He greeted them all, with the words \"Peace be unto\nyou. His eyes searched out the doubting Apostle. He called him by name and said: \"Reach\nhither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side;\nand be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and\nmy God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27716\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27716)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27716)\">John 20:27-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBut to Thomas came the distinction of receiving the last, but not the least, of the Beatitudes.\n\"Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen,\nand yet have believed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27718\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27718)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27718)\">John 20:29<\/a><\/span>).\nIs this not the very foundation of the Christian religion?\nIs it not fundamental to everything that Jesus taught and did? Thomas Didymus admitted his\ndefeat. He was prepared at that moment to recognize his Lord as the Son of God, the\nRedeemer of the world. Thus fortified Thomas Didymus, like the others, could climb the\ndifficult heights of self-denial without wavering or faltering. His faith had been restored, his\ndoubts had fled and the foundation upon which he stood would never give way.\n<\/p><p>\nFaith opens the door to an understanding of God&mdash;His character and attributes. \"And this is\nlife eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast\nsent\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27705\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27705)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27705)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>).\nThese words came from the prayer which Jesus offered to his Father for\nthe apostles and all others who believe on him.\n<\/p><p>\nFaith is constructive for it supplies the urge to do things. A people blessed with faith are\nprogressive, and invincible before difficulties. Israel was delivered from the Egyptian bondage\nthrough the exercise of faith. The pioneers found their way to a home in the West and laid the\nfoundation of a commonwealth in the desert because of their faith in God's promises. By the\nsame token the Pilgrim fathers established their ideals of civil and religious liberty in\nAmerica.\n<\/p><p>\nWithout an abiding faith the soul has no anchorage and is \"driven with the wind and tossed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26122\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26122)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26122)\">James 1:6<\/a><\/span>).\nMan's faith in God is an acknowledgment of God's power to save and exalt the\nhuman family. It recognizes the deityship of Jesus Christ and accepts his gospel as the plan of\nsalvation. It puts man in possession of vital information to lead him onward and upward, and\nto inspire him to live in harmony with divine law.\n<\/p><p>\nFaith is a gift of God to be developed by prayerful and open-minded investigation. It sets up\nhope and courage and explores the realms of the unseen. A loss of faith is a tragic setback in\nthe journey towards perfection.\n<\/p><p>\nSkepticism, on the other hand, has no vitality. It offers no program. It contradicts every claim\nto a life after death. It robs man of his belief in moral and spiritual values, and destroys his\nfondest hopes and noblest aspirations. Unbelief is negative and rejects the revelations of God\nhowever manifested.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are surrounded by many mysterious manifestations in nature and the outside world which\nwe cannot explain. And yet the miracles performed by Jesus and the Prophets have been a\nstumbling block to many whose faith is weak. These deniers of God's power have refused to\naccept the God of the Bible as the Creator and the Ruler of the universe. Jesus, Himself,\nproclaimed his supremacy when he said: \". . . All power is given unto me in heaven and in\nearth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of\nthe Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have\ncommanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34818\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34818)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34818)\">Matt. 28:18-20<\/a><\/span>).\nNo Christian can read those words without having a sense of awe and\nreverence for the Redeemer of mankind. He is the light of the world. He has no parallel\namong the many who have aspired to world leadership.\n<\/p><p>\nPaul, the Apostle, was a product of Christ's gospel. The power of faith manifested itself in the\ncomplete conquest which it made of him. There is as much difference between Saul of Tarsus\nand Paul, the Apostle, as there is between night and day. He came at a juncture in the\nChristian movement when he was most needed. His call to service in the ministry was\nunexpected for he was already listed with the enemies of the cause he later represented. His\nentire life from the day of his conversion, reflected an unconquerable faith, a firm conviction\nand an unshakable testimony which has lived for centuries.\n<\/p><p>\nHis second letter to Timothy, which may have been his last, reveals his anxiety and concern\nfor those who had joined the faith. The letter was written from his dungeon in Rome, where\nhe was a prisoner for the gospel's sake. He begs Timothy to come to him and to bring a cloak\nwhich he had left behind in one of his missionary journeys. He also asks for books and\nparchments to satisfy his yearning for knowledge and studies which he had pursued during his\nyears of missionary work. I quote from his epistle: \". . . for I know whom I have believed,\nand am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that\nday\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5122\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5122)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5122)\">2 Tim. 1:12<\/a><\/span>).\nWhat could be more reassuring?\n<\/p><p>\nHow does the letter end? I read the closing words: \"For I am now ready to be offered, and\nthe time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I\nhave kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the\nLord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them\nalso that love his appearing\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5124\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5124)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5124)\">2 Tim. 4:6-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThose words are not the strain of the vanquished. A few days later, no doubt, he was put to\ndeath by Nero, a man stained with every crime and steeped in every vice.\n<\/p><p>\nPrayer is a manifestation of Faith. Every spiritual truth and all religious attainments have been\nachieved through prayer. It is an avenue of enlightenment. In his utmost extremity man is\nhelpless and hopeless without God. Thoroughly humbled, he kneels in prayer and comes away\ntriumphant. He does what is humanly impossible. Prayer has given stimulus and effectiveness\nto his strivings.\n<\/p><p>\nThe hour has come to restore simple worship, family devotion in the home, a prayerful\napproach to daily problems, the landmarks of faith and a sense of God's eternal laws.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Master gathered his disciples at the foot of the Mount and delivered his magnificent\nSermon to them, He taught them how to pray. \". . . enter into thy closet,\" said He, \"and when\nthou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in\nsecret, shall reward thee openly\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34761\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34761)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34761)\">Matt. 6:6<\/a><\/span>).\nThe prayer of faith is a personal communion\nwith God. It is the pathway to power. It is the road to deliverance and contentment.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
