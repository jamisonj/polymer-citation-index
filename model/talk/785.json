Evans, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1955, pp. 9-12<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy beloved brethren and sisters: \n<\/p><p>\nI should like to echo from the depths of my heart this morning, that gratitude of which\nPresident McKay has so beautifully and eloquently spoken; gratitude to my Father in heaven\nfor so much beyond my ability to mention, for the onward march of his Church and kingdom,\nfor his goodness in the lives of all of us.\n<\/p><p>\nAt this time I should like to express gratitude for Sister Evans and me for the privilege we\nhave had of being witnesses of some glorious and significant events of which President\nMcKay has spoken; and gratitude for the leadership of President McKay and his Counselors,\nand for the association of these, my brethren, and you, my brethren and sisters.\n<\/p><p>\nWe watched the President under a wide variety of conditions in a number of countries of\nEurope, in several of the great cities of the continent and of Great Britain, exchanging\ngreetings with public officials, meeting in press conferences, attending the concerts, and\nparticipating in public receptions.  He was seemingly indefatigable, always gracious, always\nan effective and wonderful representative of this Church and people; not sparing himself,\ntraveling many hours and many miles sometimes to attend one of the choir concerts under\nstormy and difficult conditions, getting back to his hotel in the very early hours of the\nmorning.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to echo his gratitude for the success of this tour.\n<\/p><p>\nI think a public confession here would not be inappropriate: Some of us, many of us, maybe\nmost of us, had great apprehension and some reservations concerning the choir's tour.  I must\nconfess humbly, that some of us might have postponed it, and perhaps would have looked\nagain at the commitment to do it. I must confess that as the two trains pulled us out of Salt\nLake City on the evening of August 10, I felt, if not like a lamb going to the slaughter, at\nleast like one that was going to be shorn. But the President of the Church had committed us\nto it, and so we went. (I should hesitate to say this publicly, but when he sets a deadline, the\nseemingly impossible happens, as witness the dedication of the Swiss Temple.  When you get\na mixture of the quiet, purposeful stubbornness of the Scots and the Welsh, along with the\ncourage and conviction of a prophetic calling, you have a combination which, once having\nbeen committed to a course or a great cause, is something to be reckoned with!)\n<\/p><p>\nBlessedly and providentially, by the combined services of a great number of able and devoted\npeople, many of whom the President has mentioned, and by the hand of Providence, we had a\ngreat venture in understanding, as we so characterized it before our European audiences.\n<\/p><p>\nI am glad that the President paid tribute to all of those to whom he paid tribute and\nappreciation this morning. There are many others, who could and should be mentioned, and\nperhaps that can be done at another time and place.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, to some of the highlights, briefly: The President has mentioned the reception at\nGreenock, Scotland, by the Provost of the city and the Bagpipe Corps, and the reception of\nthe entire choir by the Lord Provost of Glasgow and the great audience at Glasgow's Kelvin\nHall the following evening.  Then we went to Manchester and to Cardiff, where the Stars\nand Stripes were raised over Cardiff Castle by the gracious Lord Mayor of that great city in\nhonor of the Tabernacle Choir and its sponsoring institution, and of the country from which it\ncame&mdash;not beneath the British flag, or any other flag, but waving there alone as we came into\nthe city, the Stars and Stripes over Cardiff Castle, with the Lord Mayor addressing us as\nbrothers and sisters, and giving every evidence of his feelings of sincerity in the terms in\nwhich he addressed us.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many other unforgettable experiences.  Berlin is one of them. We presented an\nextra concert in the afternoon for those who came, principally from the Eastern Zone, who\nwould neither be able to afford, nor, for the most part would be able to be present in the\nevening hours because of distances traveled and restrictions encountered.  To see that\naudience of those from the areas which have not known some of the great privileges and\nblessings that we have known, to feel their spirit, to feel them wanting to be demonstrative,\nwanting to overflow in appreciation, and seemingly not knowing quite how to, and then\nmelting and overflowing&mdash;it was an unforgettable experience. The audience of the evening\nwas one quite in contrast with the refugee audience and those from eastern areas who had\ncome in the afternoon.\n<\/p><p>\nThe President has mentioned the temple dedication and the concerts in Switzerland, where we\nsang in Bern and Zurich; those in Copenhagen (an extra one being presented there by our\nmale chorus in Tivoli Gardens, in response to public demand); the great audience in the Royal\nAlbert Hall in London, a place of great tradition, of great prestige, sometimes of great reserve&mdash;an\noverflow audience there in that great hall of some seven to eight thousand people,\nmelting, taking us into their hearts and we taking them into ours.  It was a wonderful and\nsatisfying and unforgettable experience.\n<\/p><p>\nThen in Paris, the final concert (not forgetting those in Amsterdam and Scheveningen in the\nNetherlands and in Wiesbaden, Germany, which were equally significant) where the city\ncouncil and the ranking officers of the city of Paris presented medals to the principals of the\nchoir and scrolls of commendation, not only to individuals, but also to some of us as\nrepresentatives of the Church, they having also passed a special appropriation for refreshments\nfor the entire group of six hundred in the magnificent city palace where royalty has been\nentertained for generations.  There was no honor that we knew of that the city of Paris could\ndo for the Tabernacle Choir and the Church and the country from which they came that they\ndid not do and extend to us.\n<\/p><p>\nEverywhere public officials of the countries in which we found ourselves, as well as our own\ndiplomatic officers, and the press, and the public, were as gracious and warm and wonderful\nas one could ask from his own kin and countrymen. Scores&mdash;hundreds&mdash;of pictures and fair\nand favorable stories appeared throughout Europe in the public press; and we were on the air\nin many places.  It seemed that virtually no doors that we had time to open were closed to\nus&mdash;and no hearts either, or so it seemed.\n<\/p><p>\nThank God for all his blessings and mercies and for far-reaching consequences beyond our\nability to estimate or to foresee.\n<\/p><p>\nI think the Berlin Telegraf summed it up in a sentence when it said in its edition immediately\nafter the Berlin concert, \"This was not only music, but the building of a human bridge.\" This\nwe also felt is what it was.\n<\/p><p>\nNow as to two or three of the sidelights: One was the language barrier. What happened at the\nTower of Babel never should have happened, but by the perverseness of men it did, and by\nthe dispersion of men it has continued. We wrestled with it all the way, but not with so much\ndifficulty as we might have supposed.  In all places to which we went a large percentage of\nour audiences were bilingual and understood us without translators.  We used interpreters, but\nin many places the reaction of the audience to the English was more immediate than the\nreaction to the translations which followed.\n<\/p><p>\nWe found no insurmountable barrier of language or of geography to understanding among\nmen.  We found nothing that could prevent sincere and honest people from taking one another\nto the hearts of each other, in peace, in honor, and in understanding.\n<\/p><p>\nWe found nothing to cause us to come to any conclusion except that all men are children of\nthe Lord God, and that all are precious in his sight.  We found no people that we could not\nlove. We found no people for whom we did not come away with affection in our souls and in\nour hearts.  We found no people for whom we did not feel a genuine, deep, and grateful\nfriendship. Thank God for this, also&mdash;for not letting the barriers of language or of boundaries\nor of geography keep us from a satisfying and glorious understanding.\n<\/p><p>\nThere were some other sidelights. We had about two-thirds of the passenger list on the SS\n<i>Saxonia<\/i>, on which we sailed from Montreal to Europe&mdash;some six hundred out of a passenger\nlist of some nine hundred.  I think perhaps the most frustrated man on the SS <i>Saxonia<\/i> on this\ntrip was the bartender! (I think perhaps the next most frustrated man aboard was the steward\nwho operated the bingo game!)\n<\/p><p>\nThere were many incidents of humor, some of illness and difficulty, but despite fatigue,\ndespite difficult and sometimes discouraging conditions and a close, demanding schedule, the\nchoir rose magnificently on every occasion and did a marvelous and wonderful service.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful this morning in following the theme of gratitude, for the courage and conviction\nof President McKay in committing us to the tour, despite our fears and apprehensions.  I am\ngrateful for the favorable outcome, which is beyond our ability to estimate.\n<\/p><p>\nIf I may be pardoned another thought or two of personal gratitude: I am grateful that my\ngracious wife was with us.  I was proud of her performance at press conferences and public\nreceptions and on all other occasions (as I was of Sister McKay also, and those who were\nwith her and the President). I am grateful to have our eldest son serving among the\nmissionaries of Europe (hundreds of whom we have met), serving in my own field of labor at\nprecisely the age, even to the month, at which I entered the same field, some twenty-nine\nyears ago.  I am grateful for the work of all the missionaries, and the mission presidents, and\nall the devoted people, and for the onward move and the great and glorious achievements and\nprogress and opportunities that are ours.\n<\/p><p>\nWe come back not much given to boasting.  We are aware of the art and culture of Europe,\nof its great cathedrals, of its great contributions, its great peoples, its great history, its great\naccomplishments, and are not so much disposed to boast of ourselves or of any physical\nattainments.  I am not sure that we have the greatest of many things here.  But of this I am\nsure, and of this I bear you witness this day: that we have the greatest message for mankind,\nthe gospel of Jesus Christ restored in its fullness, and the greatest opportunity to convey it to\nothers that any people ever had, and the greatest responsibility upon us to do it.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to do it and to meet the greatness of this responsibility.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to close with a few words from the closing sentences of King Benjamin's great\nsermon to his people, from the Book of Mormon: \n<\/p><p>\nMy friends and my brethren, my kindred and my people . . .\n<\/p><p>\nif ye have come to a knowledge of the goodness of God, and his matchless power, and\nhis wisdom, and his patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and\nalso, the atonement which has been prepared from the foundation of the world, that\nthereby salvation might come to him that should put his trust in the Lord, and should\nbe diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the end\nof his life . . .\n<\/p><p>\nthis is the means whereby salvation cometh.  And there is none other salvation save\nthis which hath been spoken of; neither are there any conditions whereby man can be\nsaved except the conditions which I have told you.\n<\/p><p>\nBelieve in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in\nearth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth;\nbelieve that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble\nyourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and\nnow, if you believe all these things see that ye do them.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled\nwith the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in\nthe knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which\nis just and true (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40267\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40267)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40267)\">Mosiah 4:4,6,8-10,12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to have the courage and the wisdom to be what we should be, to live as we\nshould live, to do what we should do, and to arise to the greatest message to mankind and to\nthe greatest opportunity and responsibility that is ours, to deliver it, I pray in Jesus' name.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
