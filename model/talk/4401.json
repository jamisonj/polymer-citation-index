I sustain him as a living prophet of God! He was ordained an Apostle in 1943, before I entered medical school. Now he is the senior Apostle on earth, and I am privileged to add my gratitude for a prophet and for his message of instruction and inspiration.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/life-after-life.p4\" class=\"\">He has taught us of the ministry of the resurrected Lord to the inhabitants of ancient America. This precious knowledge recorded in the Book of Mormon is of transcendent importance to all people. Truly, the Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/life-after-life.p5\" class=\"\">As President Benson spoke, my thoughts momentarily flashed back some years ago to a conversation I had with a book publisher. He was interested in the topic of possible continuation of life after what we know as death. The publisher asked if I could contribute stories from patients who had come close enough to death to experience the other side and yet had survived to share those accounts. Sensing public interest in that subject, he would entitle the book <span class=\"emphasis\">Life after Life.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/life-after-life.p6\" class=\"\">When I considered that request, I remembered many such incidents which had been whispered in confidence to me over the years. But those seemed too sacred to share in a worldly way, especially to the benefit of a commercial venture. Besides, what would be the validity of isolated stories of life after life without supporting testimonies of witnesses?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/life-after-life.p7\" class=\"\">To me, much more logical and convincing would be a study of well-documented and carefully witnessed evidences of life after life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/life-after-life.p8\" class=\"\">President Benson has spoken of one of these priceless records.
