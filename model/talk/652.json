Bennion, I want to assure him and\nassure you that I can support him in his new position one hundred percent. I am sure with his\nintellectual talents, the faith that he has in God, that he will add greatly to the strength of the\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\nIn listening to the reports of the twenty-five or more mission presidents I noted that each one\npaid a glowing tribute to his wife. Certainly these sisters and the others of the Church are\ndoing a wonderful work and, incidentally, are equal to any occasion, and possibly I may be\npardoned if I tell a little experience that would prove this to the brethren.\n<\/p><p>\nOn one occasion a small boy returned from Sunday School where apparently they had been\ntalking about the Darwinian theory, and as he entered the home, he said, \"Mother, am I\ndescended from a monkey?\" She said, \"I don't know, Jimmy, I didn't know your father's\nfolks very well.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIf I may enjoy an interest in your feelings and the Spirit of the Lord for a few minutes, I\nwould like to speak upon a subject that I have chosen to call \"Monuments to Spirituality.\"\nFirst I would like to make mention of the new temple under construction in Los Angeles. It\nwas my privilege just a week ago this morning, after attending a conference in the Los\nAngeles Stake, to be shown through the construction work there by Elder Soren Jacobsen,\ndirectly in charge of building operations. And I think that he must have had in mind the spirit\nof the ancient prophet who said, \"Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that\nbuild it\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41778\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41778)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41778)\">Ps. 127:1<\/a><\/span>),\nfor you will be interested to know that every morning before they\nstart work, he calls the workmen together and there have a word of prayer. I'm sure that that\npractice is going to pay dividends in finer construction and certainly a greater interest in the\nwork. And I was happy to notice that during the hour and a half I spent going through those\nworkings I never saw one man loafing, nor anyone using tobacco, and I never heard one man\nprofaning. Now, that may not always be the case, but at least we hope that it might be.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I have traveled through a number of the stakes of Zion, I have been thrilled and impressed\nwith the wonderful new buildings that have been erected in the wards and stakes. Indeed they\nconstitute a source of pride to every Latter-day Saint, and they are a credit to the community,\nand a still greater credit to the Church. They all have a spire pointing heavenward,\nindicating that they are houses of the Lord. They are well designed and built of\nfine materials. After the landscaping of the grounds around them, they are an inspiration and\nincentive for all the members of our Church living in those communities to beautify their own\nplaces.\n<\/p><p>\nAs you enter these buildings, you are thrilled with the wonderful facilities for worship,\nclasswork, and recreation provided for the old and young alike. The chapel, recreation hall,\nand all other rooms are so artistically decorated, with the colors of the walls, drapes, and floor\ncoverings blending into such an attractive picture, that you know expert attention has been\ngiven to these items.\n<\/p><p>\nThe building of these lovely edifices has afforded the opportunity of bringing into activity\nmany of the inactive members of the Church. I think it is safe to say that because of the\nconstruction since the war of these nine hundred or more buildings that have been dedicated\nor are ready for dedication or are now under construction that in each case there have been at\nleast ten or twelve inactive men brought into the Church, and that would mean at least 10,000\nfamilies, formerly inactive in the Church, now active and enjoying the great blessings of the\ngospel.\n<\/p><p>\nThis building program hasn't been confined to the stakes and wards but has spread out into\nthe mission fields in all parts of the foreign lands except behind the \"iron curtain,\" and the\nisles of the sea. I know that every mission president present here today and those still out in\nthe foreign fields can testify that these new places, and those that have been purchased,\nproviding lovely places in which to meet, have been a great help to them in the proselyting\nwork. You have no idea how wonderful it is for a missionary after working with certain\ninvestigators to be able to invite them into a suitable place in which to worship.\n<\/p><p>\nI was asked by the president of the Western Canadian Mission as I met him the other day to\nplease tell my brother that the prophecy which he made at the time he dedicated the beautiful\nchapel up in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in which he stated, \"This building will be a\nmissionary of the Church,\" has been literally fulfilled, and that many prominent people of that\nrapidly growing city are becoming interested in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nOver in the British Mission a number of years ago, I understand that consideration was given\nto the closing of the Scottish District because there were only a very few converts being made\nthere. During the last three years there has been an average of seventy-five to a hundred\nbaptisms, and I think to a great extent it is because of the fine, suitable places of worship\nowned by the Church now in the cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, and Aberdeen. Just a\nshort time ago I had the privilege of interviewing a returned missionary from France, and he\ntold me that he attended the last baptismal service held in that mission and that a number of\nthose that were baptized first got their interest in the Church because of the fine building that\nthe Church now owns in Paris.\n<\/p><p>\nIt has been stated that each fine building is equal to ten missionaries. If this is the case, then\nthere have been added 9,000 or more silent but effective \"preachers of righteousness\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39041\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39041)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39041)\">Moses 6:23<\/a><\/span>) to the force.\n<\/p><p>\nThese buildings, my brethren and sisters, are all made possible by the payment of tithes and\ncontributions of cash and labor by the membership of the Church, and I say unto you, God\nbless you, my brethren and sisters, for your faith and for your generosity. Also I am sure that\nwe're all grateful and often go to our knees in prayer in appreciation to the Lord for the First\nPresidency of our Church, for their foresight and their wisdom in inaugurating this great\nbuilding program of the Church. We have been growing rapidly, spiritually, and it became\nnecessary to grow in a physical way to take care of the membership of the\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\nPossibly it may not be considered inappropriate to say a word about the building department\nof the Church under the direction of Elder Howard J. McKean and his associates. They have\ncaused these monuments to spirituality and faith to be erected with good designs, excellent\nmaterials, and fine workmanship. Because they are practical builders, they have been able to\neffect substantial savings to the Church and to the wards and stakes. Great faith has been\nmanifested by the bishops, stake presidents, and local building committees in undertaking the\nconstruction of these lovely buildings. A faith-promoting volume could be written about the\nrich experiences that have come to them. The blessings of the Lord have known no bounds. It\nwould seem that the spirit of the pioneer builders had returned, for they built by faith. As an\noutstanding example, may I mention about this Tabernacle in which we are now worshiping.\nIt is 150 feet wide by 250 feet long and 70 feet high. It was built between 1863 and 1867\nwhen no finished materials or bolts or steel nails or modern tools were available. They had\nonly the timbers of the nearby canyons and very crude tools and machinery. Under these\nconditions, it took strong faith to undertake the erection of this unusual elliptical roof. The\nlattice trusses fitted together with wooden pegs and cowhide must span 150 feet. The least\nspreading of the trusses would kick out the stone piers below. A prominent engineer of the\neast, after examining this roof on the inside, stated that it constituted the greatest\ndemonstration of faith that he had seen in any construction.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my brethren and sisters, and especially you bishops and stake and mission presidents,\nwe now rejoice in and are grateful for these beautiful buildings. May I make just a few\nsuggestions to you? In the first place, let us keep them all clean and in order and maintain\nthem in good condition. Then let's encourage all of our people to show respect and reverence\nto them as houses of the Lord. Above everything else, let us follow the advice just given by\nElder Moyle: Let us serve as leaders in the wards, and stakes, and missions in these buildings,\nin the spirit of love and kindness. Let us carry on our work as the Master says, \"Serve each\nother in love,\" in such a way that no offenses can be taken by anyone. Finally, though it may\nnot be possible to have neon signs at the top of all of these spires as I would like to see, with\nthese words: \"Jesus is the Christ,\" let us hope that the testimonies of the leaders and members\nalike bear witness of this great truth and this work is of God, and that the gospel as\nestablished in the last days is for the salvation of all honest people throughout the world. And\nthen again, let us invite all visitors to come to these places and assure them that they will\nnever be embarrassed by having a collection plate passed before them. Freely we have\nreceived, and freely we give (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34568\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34568)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34568)\">Matt. 10:8<\/a><\/span>)\nunto the world. God bless you all, my brethren and sisters, I\nhumbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
