We are going to need that change. Someday, in our families and as a people, we will live as one, seeking each other\u2019s good.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p16\" class=\"\">You know from studying Church history that we have tried to live as one in a variety of settings. A story from one of those tries, in Orderville, Utah, gives us a clue as to why it is so hard.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p17\" class=\"\">Orderville was founded in 1870 and 1871 by people who wanted to live the united order; in 1875, they began the order. They built housing units in a square, with a common dining hall. They built a storehouse, shoe shop, bakery, blacksmith shop, tannery, schoolhouse, sheep shed, and woolen factory. They grew and made nearly everything they needed, from soap to trousers. They had carpenters, midwives, teachers, artists, and musicians. They produced enough surplus that they could sell it in neighboring towns for cash: with that they built up a capital fund to buy more land and equipment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p18\" class=\"\">The population rose to seven hundred people. One hundred and fifty of them gave Orderville a special advantage: they had come to Orderville from the mission on the Muddy River, where they had nearly starved. When those who had been called to the Muddy were released, they were in near destitution. Twenty-four of those families went to Long Valley, founded Orderville, and pledged all they had to the Lord. They didn\u2019t have much, but their poverty may have been their greatest contribution. Their having almost nothing provided a basis for future comparison that might have guaranteed gratitude: any food or clothing or housing that came to them in Orderville would be treasure compared to their privation on the Muddy mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p19\" class=\"\">But time passed, the railroad came, and a mining boom put cash in the hands of people in the neighboring towns. They could buy imported clothes, and they did. The people in Orderville were living better than they had in years, but the memory of poverty on the Muddy had faded. They now focused on what was in the next town. And so they felt old-fashioned and deprived.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p20\" class=\"\">One ingenious boy acted on the discontent he felt when he was denied a new pair of pants from the Orderville factory because his were not worn out yet. He secretly gathered the docked lambs\u2019 tails from the spring crop. He sheared the wool from them and stored it in sacks. Then, when he was sent with a load of wool to sell in Nephi, he took his sacks along and exchanged them for a pair of store pants. He created a sensation when he wore the new-style pants to the next dance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p21\" class=\"\">The president of the order asked him what he had done. The boy gave an honest answer. So they called him into a meeting and told him to bring the pants. They commended him for his initiative, pointed out that the pants really belonged to the order, and took them. But they told him this: the pants would be taken apart, used as a pattern, and henceforth Orderville pants would have the new store-bought style. And he would get the first pair.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p22\" class=\"\">That did not quite end the pants rebellion. Orders for new pants soon swamped the tailoring department. When the orders were denied because pants weren\u2019t yet worn out, boys began slipping into the shed where the grinding wheel was housed. Soon, pants began to wear out quickly. The elders gave in, sent a load of wool out to trade for cloth, and the new-style pants were produced for everyone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p23\" class=\"\">You know that isn\u2019t a happy ending. There were many challenges Orderville faced in the ten years they lived the order there. One of them they never really conquered. It was the problem of not remembering. That is a problem we must solve, too.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p24\" class=\"\">Just as they forgot poverty on the Muddy, we so easily forget that we came into life with nothing. Whatever we get soon seems our natural right, not a gift. And we forget the giver. Then our gaze shifts from what we have been given to what we don\u2019t have yet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p25\" class=\"\">God has used one method over and over to help with that problem of remembering. A group of people in the Book of Mormon record lost their flocks, their herds, and their fields of grain. Some lost their lives. And then the survivors remembered. In Alma it says: \u201cAnd so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon them because of their wickedness and their abominations; therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9699\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9699)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9699)\">Alma 4:3<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p26\" class=\"\">Confronting death and difficulty does return memory and therefore gratitude to righteous people as well as the wicked. But there must be another way to remember, one we can choose.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p27\" class=\"\">There is. A servant of God named King Benjamin taught it to his people and to us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p28\" class=\"\">He taught them that none of us is above another because we are all dust, to which God has given life and then sustained it [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"40723\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40723)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40723)\">Mosiah 2:25\u201326<\/a><\/span>]. He described a fact which is true for every human being: unforgiven sin will bring us unending torment. And he described the gift we all have been offered: those whose faith in Jesus Christ leads them to repentance and forgiveness will live in never-ending happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p29\" class=\"\">King Benjamin\u2019s teaching had a miraculous effect. Gratitude for what they had led to faith unto repentance. That led to forgiveness. That produced new gratitude. And then King Benjamin taught that, if we can remember and so remain grateful, we will retain a remission of our sins through all the losses and the gains of life. He taught it this way:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and have tasted of his love, and have received a remission of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40727\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40727)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40727)\">Mosiah 4:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p32\" class=\"\">How can you and I remember, always, the goodness of God, that we can retain a remission of our sins?

I presume most of us have not thought of that as a great sin. There is a great tendency for us in our prayers and in our pleadings with the Lord to ask for additional blessings. But sometimes I feel we need to devote more of our prayers to expressions of gratitude and thanksgiving for blessings already received. We enjoy so much.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">God, Family, Country,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1974, p. 199.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p36\" class=\"\">You could have an experience with the gift of the Holy Ghost today. You could begin a private prayer with thanks. You could start to count your blessings, and then pause for a moment. If you exercise faith, and with the gift of the Holy Ghost, you will find that memories of other blessings will flood into your mind. If you begin to express gratitude for each of them, your prayer may take a little longer than usual. Remembrance will come. And so will gratitude.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p37\" class=\"\">You could try the same thing as you write an entry in your book of remembrance. The Holy Ghost has helped with that since the beginning of time. You remember in the record of Moses it says: \u201cAnd a book of remembrance was kept, in the which was recorded, in the language of Adam, for it was given unto as many as called upon God to write by the spirit of inspiration.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39767\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39767)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39767)\">Moses 6:5<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/remembrance-and-gratitude.p38\" class=\"\">President Spencer W.
