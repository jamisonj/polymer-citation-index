It had been running wild in the hills.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood.p69\" class=\"\">It took nearly all day to get the herd to the corral and to tie his horse up with a heavy halter and a rope.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood.p70\" class=\"\">I told him that his horse must stay tied there until it settled down; he could talk to it, carefully touch it, but he must not, under any circumstance, untie it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood.p71\" class=\"\">We finally went in for our supper. He quickly ate and rushed back out to see his horse. Presently I heard him cry out. I knew what had happened. He had untied his horse. He was going to train it to lead. As the horse pulled away from him he instinctively did something I had told him never, never to do. He looped the rope around his wrist to get a better grip.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood.p72\" class=\"\">As I ran from the house, I saw the horse go by. Our boy could not release the rope; he was being pulled with great leaping steps. And then he went down! If the horse had turned to the right, he would have been dragged out the gate and into the hills and would certainly have lost his life. It turned to the left, and for a moment was hung up in a fence corner\u2014just long enough for me to loop the rope around a post and to free my son.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood.p73\" class=\"\">Then came a father-to-son chat! \u201cSon, if you are ever going to control that horse, you will have to use something besides your muscles. The horse is bigger than you are, it is stronger than you are, and it always will be. Someday you may ride your horse if you train it to be obedient, a lesson that you must learn yourself first.\u201d He had learned a very valuable lesson.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood.p74\" class=\"\">Two summers later we went again to the ranch to look for his horse. It had been running all winter with the wild herd. We found them in a meadow down by the river. I watched from a hillside as he and his sister moved carefully to the edge of the meadow. The horses moved nervously away. Then he whistled. His horse hesitated, then left the herd and trotted up to them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood.p75\" class=\"\">He had learned that there is great power in things that are not seen, such unseen things as obedience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood.p76\" class=\"\">Just as obedience to principle gave him power to train his horse, obedience to the priesthood has taught him to control himself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood.p77\" class=\"\">Throughout your life you will belong to a quorum of the priesthood; your brethren will be a strength and a support to you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood.p78\" class=\"\">More than that\u2014you will have the privilege of being a support to them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-aaronic-priesthood.p79\" class=\"\">Much of what I have told you about the Aaronic Priesthood applies to the Melchizedek Priesthood as well.
