I\nhave been coming to this house since my infancy. I have seen all the Presidents of the Church\nsince that time sustained by the congregation here, as their names have been presented from\nthis stand. I have seen the Church continue to grow in numbers, and have realized throughout\nall my years that the Church of Jesus Christ is what its name implies. We who are members\nof this Church are indeed fortunate to have found the light and to have accepted the truth.\n<\/p><p>\nGROWTH OF THE CHURCH\n<\/p><p>\nIn the year 1830, the Church was organized with six members. The adversary of all\nrighteousness (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8842\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8842)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8842)\">Alma 34:23<\/a><\/span>)\nhas from that day to the present sought to impede its progress and destroy it. I\nwonder if that great man, Joseph Smith, who gave his life that the Church might be organized\nand carried on as the Lord intended, can see the Church as it exists today, with its branches\nestablished in all parts of the world, and realize that each day since he was martyred, since he\nlaid down his life and sealed his testimony with his blood, the Church has become stronger\nthan the day before.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom this stand addresses have been delivered by some of the great teachers of the world.\nSome of the greatest students of the scriptures have explained the gospel from this stand, and\nmen and women from everywhere have worshiped here. Yesterday, this house was apparently\nas full of the membership of the Women's Relief Society of the Church as it is today with\nboth men and women together. Through that great organization, the Relief Society, begun by\nthe Prophet Joseph, was given to womankind the dispensation of representing the Lord in\ntheir way as daughters, as wives, as mothers, and as representatives of their kind in all the\nworld.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE RESTORATION OF THE GOSPEL\n<\/p><p>\nWe have had sustained here today various of the quorums of the priesthood, each one directed\nin its organization by our Heavenly Father. It was not a matter of personal wisdom on the part\nof individuals. In each case there was necessity for group organization, and as the Church\ngrew and multiplied in numbers, the quorums have correspondingly increased until today in\nall parts of the world there are men divinely appointed, set apart, and endowed with divine\nauthority, who state positively that they know whereof they speak when they testify that Jesus\nwas the Christ, the Son of God, who died that we might all live. The Church that he\norganized in his day represented his Father and himself in all the parts of the world where it\nwas established. In our day, by the direction of Jesus Christ our Lord, this Church was\norganized. It wasn't organized from just the imagination of men and women. There came a\nnecessity that the priesthood of the living God be restored. A youth was selected to begin the\nwork. When he was less than fifteen years of age, Joseph Smith lived at or near Palmyra,\nNew York state, on a little farm. He was confused about what he should do, or which church\nhe should join. The various denominations in that community were holding revival meetings\nand one group was saying, &ldquo;This is the way,&rdquo; and another, &ldquo;This is the way,&rdquo; until he, being\nof a naturally religious turn of mind, having lived in a home where the Bible, the holy\nscripture, was read (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30229\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30229)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30229)\">JS&mdash;H 1:11-13<\/a><\/span>),\nfound in one passage of James:\n<\/p><p>\n&ldquo;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and\nupbraideth not; and it shall be given him&rdquo;\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26055\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26055)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26055)\">James 1:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE COMING FORTH OF THE BOOK OF MORMON\n<\/p><p>\nAlthough a boy fourteen years of age, he went into the woods near his home, into one of\nGod's first temples, bowed down upon the ground, and asked the Lord in his confusion,\n&ldquo;Which of these churches shall I join?&rdquo; I have no doubt he was surprised when the answer\ncame to him, &ldquo;Join none of them.&rdquo; And then he was told that if he would obey the direction\nof our Heavenly Father, an important mission would be given for him to perform under divine\ndirection (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30234\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30234)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30234)\">JS&mdash;H 1:18-19<\/a><\/span>).\nThat was not the idea of a man who desired to deceive; it was the humble, simple\nfaith of a boy. So he continued following the inspiration of the Lord. He continued carrying\nout the directions that were given to him by holy beings, the result of which was the\nuncovering in the Hill Cumorah of the golden plates from which the Book of Mormon, the\nhistory of the ancestors of the American Indians, was translated and published. Since then that\nbook has been carried to the ends of the world, having been published in many languages. He\nwas only a young man when that occurred. When the time came for its publication, he was\nridiculed. People derided him and called him a money digger because he worked for a living\nand had to earn that living part of the time digging in the earth. But they didn't look upon\nhim as a servant of the Lord; neither did the majority of the people in the days of the Savior\naccept Jesus Christ of Nazareth as a servant of the Lord. The great majority rejected Christ\nand rejected each of his followers who became members of the quorum of the Twelve.\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph Smith persisted in his work; and when the Book of Mormon was finally about to come\nfrom the press, after having been translated through the gift and power of God, for it was in a\nlanguage unknown to him, the people in the neighborhood of Palmyra agreed that they would\nnot buy it, thinking that they would thwart the bringing forth of the book. They supposed that\ntheir refusal to purchase it would make impossible the completion of its publication.\n<\/p><p>\nThere had been written in that book at the time of its compilation the statement that the book\nwould be received by many people (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3466\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3466)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3466)\">2 Ne. 30:3<\/a><\/span>).\nJoseph Smith didn't eliminate that statement when it\ncame to publication. When the people said, &ldquo;We'll not read it,&rdquo; he did not take it out and say,\n&ldquo;Well, I can't fulfill this.&rdquo; If he had been writing the book himself, he probably would have\nchanged the script, but it was not his script, and so it went to the world. I was present a few\nyears ago when the Smith farm near the Hill Cumorah was purchased, and as I went through\nthe neighborhood I found only one copy of the Book of Mormon. That was owned by a man\nnamed Pliny T. Sexton, who was chancellor of the University of New York and the banker at\nPalmyra. He had a copy of the first edition of the Book of Mormon as it came from the press.\nThe leaves had never been cut, and he kept it in the safe in the bank. I asked him, &ldquo;Is there\nany place here where I can find another copy of the Book of Mormon?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I do not\nknow.&rdquo; I then began to inquire among the people and found that the people of Palmyra had\nkept their word. They had neither bought nor would they read it. At that time Palmyra was a\nvillage and is still a village, but the Book of Mormon that was discredited then has since been\nread and accepted by people in all parts of the earth, people from many nations, numbering\nhundreds of thousands, and the work is still going forward, fulfilling the prediction that it was\nto be made\n<\/p><p>\n&ldquo;. . . known to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the\nEternal Father, and the Savior of the world; and that all men must come unto him, or they\ncannot be saved&rdquo; (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1460\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1460)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1460)\">1 Ne. 13:40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE SAINTS MOVED FROM PLACE TO PLACE\n<\/p><p>\nMen may conspire to prevent the work of the Lord, as they have done when they are\nprompted by the adversary, but his work has continued to grow from that day until the present\ntime. As the Church grew, the people were compelled to move from their smaller places.\nPalmyra became too small, and they moved to Kirtland, Ohio. That became undesirable, so\nthey moved into Missouri, from which state they were banished by the edict of the governor,\nand many of them laid down their lives as martyrs to the cause. The people then passed\nacross the Mississippi River into the state of Illinois. In fewer than seven years that group of\npeople, led by the youthful Prophet who had now grown to be a man, erected buildings and a\nmagnificent temple which was the finest building in its day in the state of Illinois. In less than\nseven years Nauvoo became the largest city in the state, regardless of persecution and\neverything that was done to prevent the growth of the gospel of Jesus Christ that the\nadversary could inspire, including murder and every other wrong that goes with it.\n<\/p><p>\nPROPHECY REGARDING SETTLEMENT IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS\n<\/p><p>\nAt that time Springfield was a city of about twelve thousand and Chicago had a population of\nabout five thousand. The Prophet of the Lord prophesied one day:\n<\/p><p>\n&ldquo;. . . the Saints would continue to suffer much affliction and would be driven to the Rocky\nMountains; many would apostatize; others would be put to death by our persecutors, or lose\ntheir lives in consequence of exposure or disease, and some of them would live to go and\nassist in making settlements and build cities and see the Saints become a mighty people in the\nmidst of the Rocky Mountains&rdquo; (<i>History of the Church<\/i>, Vol. 5, p. 85).\n<\/p><p>\nThink of such a prediction at that time. The Saints were then four or five hundred miles east\nfrom where Omaha now is, and Omaha is approximately a thousand miles from the Salt Lake\nValley. For the Prophet of God to say that they would be driven from there and go fifteen\nhundred miles into the wilderness, and there become a mighty people was a remarkable\nstatement indeed. Has that prophecy been fulfilled? Our presence here today attests that it has.\n<\/p><p>\nREVELATION ON THE WORD OF WISDOM\n<\/p><p>\nI could, if I had time, open to you the D&amp;C containing the prophecies, the revelations of God\nto the Prophet Joseph Smith, and show that one by one they have been fulfilled, not by\nJoseph Smith's power but by the power of God. In referring to the advice and counsel\ncontained in the eighty-ninth section of the D&amp;C, the Lord made this promise:\n<\/p><p>\n&ldquo;And all saints who remember to keep and do these things, walking in obedience to the\ncommandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; And shall find\nwisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures&rdquo;\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12166\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12166)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12166)\">D&amp;C 89:18-19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhile Joseph Smith might write those words, he couldn't fulfill that promise. I stand here\ntoday as one of the humblest among you, as the result of the observance of the requirements\nof that revelation and other commandments that God has given. Observance of that\ncommandment has placed the membership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nin the tops of these everlasting mountains in a class by themselves. Not only do we have the\nlowest death rate of any people in all the world, but we also have a high birth rate as well.\nThat was the promise that was given by the Lord in the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith.\nThe Lord said that the destroying angels should pass by us and not slay us if we kept his\ncounsel (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12168\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12168)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12168)\">D&amp;C 89:21<\/a><\/span>). What has been another result? The age of men and women in the Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints has increased until the average term of life among us is longer\nthan among any other people in the world.\n<\/p><p>\nAnother promise: The Lord said that he would give to those who would keep this word of\nwisdom, &ldquo;great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures&rdquo;\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12167\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12167)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12167)\">D&amp;C 89:19<\/a><\/span>).\nI refer you to the February,\n1944, number of <i>The Improvement Era<\/i> wherein was published a graph showing the relative\nposition of the states of the Union as to the number of scientists born in those states in\nproportion to population. Strange as it may seem, if you began at the lower corner of that\ngraph and followed up state by state, you would come to the state of Massachusetts next to\nthe highest on the graph, yet you would not have reached the state of Utah. You have to go\ntwenty percent points higher up the graph to find Utah, the state that has produced more\nscientists born within its borders per capita than any other state in the American Union. That\nwasn't an accident; it was a fulfilment of the promise of God as a result of observance of the\nLord's commandments. And so I call attention this morning to the fact that when we do\nrepresent our Heavenly Father in the way that he has desired, these blessings follow and are\nnot an accident. They are the direct fulfilment of God's promises through his Prophet.\n<\/p><p>\nA PROMISE MADE AS A REWARD FOR LOYALTY\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so today, my brethren, standing here in humility before you, I would like to express to\nyou my gratitude that you have seen fit to promise that you will help the humble man who\nhas been called to preside over this Church as he strives to carry on by the inspiration of the\nAlmighty. For this promise I am grateful, and I thank you that you have offered to do the\nsame thing with regard to the two men who stand by my side as counselors, loyal and true\nand devoted Latter-day Saints, who have done everything to make my responsibility easier for\nme to carry. You voted to sustain the Quorum of the Twelve, the quorum that I belonged to\nfor so many years that I felt like a stranger, almost, when I walked out of it to occupy the\nposition as President of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so I might go on with all these quorums. You have held up your hands in the presence\nof God to sustain this body of men in the leadership of the Church. I assure you that if you\nwill fulfill your promise, the blessings of our Heavenly Father will abide with you and in your\nhomes and with your loved ones, and Zion will continue to grow and spread abroad, and the\ntruth will be carried to every land and clime and the power of the priesthood will be made\nmanifest among our Father's children in many places where it has never yet even been heard.\nYou men who are here, or who hold the priesthood, have that responsibility, and as one of the\nnumber, I would like to say, we can't let our own personal affairs stand in the way. If the call\ncomes for us to divide the gospel of Jesus Christ with our Father's other children, it will be\nour privilege as well as our duty to put our own affairs in order, and like Joseph Smith and\nthe men who began with the Church in the early days, go where we may be called to go. One\nof our departed brethren, Melvin J. Ballard, used to sing so beautifully, &ldquo;I'll go where you\nwant me to go, dear Lord; I'll be what you want me to be.&rdquo; That's the spirit of the gospel of\nJesus Christ. Great is the joy that comes into the hearts of the men and the women who\ndevote themselves to doing what our Heavenly Father desires them to do.\n<\/p><p>\nPRAISE FOR THE WOMEN OF THE CHURCH\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to say to this great body of priesthood, you are fortunate men if you have been\nblessed with a good wife, a daughter of God, to stand by your side. And I want to say to you\nthat God loves her just as much as he loves you. If you would have his blessings, you will\ntreat her with love and kindness and tenderness and helpfulness. She will then be able to carry\non under the responsibilities that come to her to bring children into the world and nurture and\ncare for them and teach them the plan of life and salvation. And so I plead with you, my\nbrethren, let your homes be the abiding place of love, and the authority that you bear should\nmagnify that love in your soul and in the lives of your wives and your children.\n<\/p><p>\nYesterday this house was filled with the daughters of Zion, and I say without hesitation that\nyou could find no more beautiful picture of womankind in all the world than was here\nyesterday afternoon. These faithful wives, these faithful daughters, assume their portion of the\nburden and carry it on. They make their homes a heaven when sometimes without them the\nhomes would be anything but heaven.\n<\/p><p>\nSo today, my brethren, I feel to say to you, grateful am I for membership in this Church.\nThankful am I that I have lived among this people. I want to express my gratitude to\nhundreds of you who are here today for the courtesies and the hospitality that many of you\nhave extended to me. I realize that it is not because of the man that you have extended these\ncourtesies, but because he represented the Lord as his humble servant. You have earned your\nblessing and will continue to have it for all your kind deeds extended to his servants.\n<\/p><p>\nWORK OF EARLY DAY LEADERS\n<\/p><p>\nNow, as I stand here I realize that those who gave their lives in the early rise of the Church,\nincluding Joseph Smith and Hyrum, his brother, could have run away from the danger that\nthreatened them. They knew, however, that that was not the thing their Heavenly Father\ndesired. So they remained behind, after having finished their work; and under the leadership\nand direction of the Prophet, who by the way was the younger of the two brothers, builded a\ntemple to God on the banks of the mighty Mississippi River in the beautiful city of Nauvoo,\nand they built it to completion far enough so that the ordinances of the Holy Priesthood were\nadministered, and marriage for eternity was consummated therein. And since the erection of\nthe Nauvoo Temple, the same blessings given there have followed in the other temples to the\nnumber of nine. Think of it, my brethren. Beginning only a comparatively few years ago with\nsix members, day by day the work of God has gone forward among the children of men. No\nlonger are the Latter-day Saints despised as they used to be, because the adversary had\nmisrepresented them, but they are now respected by great and good men everywhere because\nof what has been accomplished. We could not have made these achievements except that our\nHeavenly Father had made it possible for us to do it. So, we ought to be thankful this day.\n<\/p><p>\nI ask that the Lord may take us to our homes when we have finished our labors with this\nconference, and that each of us will go back to the roof that shelters us, wherever it may be,\nwith the renewed determination that God, being our helper\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41735\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41735)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41735)\">Ps. 54:4<\/a><\/span>), we will prove worthy of him in\nwhose image we have been created. If we will do that, there will radiate from our very\npresence, wherever we go, a power of righteousness, and the communities in which we live\nwill be blessed thereby.\n<\/p><p>\nGRATITUDE FOR BLESSINGS\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful to these wonderful organizations, without naming them, that have carried their\npart of the responsibility. You voted for the leadership of these here today. I am grateful for\nthe Tabernacle choir and the other glorious choirs that we have throughout the Church. This\nmarvelous Tabernacle choir and organ that hold forth every Sabbath day have preached the\ngospel to the ends of the earth, because its program has been carried everywhere And then we\nhave the Singing Mothers of the Relief Society. They not only do what the Lord desires them\nto do in their lives, but they sing praises to him and teach others to do the same.\n<\/p><p>\nHow blessed we are in this house, sanctified to God by the teachings that have been given\nhere by righteous men and women. Here we are today, not as a conglomerate community, but\nas a band of brothers and sisters, worshiping at the same shrine, praying to the same God,\nliving the same gospel, keeping our homes under the supervision of the same spirit. I don't\nknow how any one of us can enjoy these blessings without having his feelings exalted and\nfrom the depths of his soul thank him who bestows upon us all our blessings.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that our Heavenly Father may continue his favor; that peace, comfort, and satisfaction\nmay abide in your homes; that these men who are in the various mission fields of the earth,\nmay be magnified before the people and exercise the authority that has been conferred upon\nthem to build, not destroy, but to build a better world that our Heavenly Father will be\ndelighted to honor and to bless because of its righteousness The Lord bless you in your\nmissionary fields of labor, and all of you men in your various callings, all you women in your\nhomes and abiding places, and the organizations with which you are identified. May the Lord\nbestow every blessing, and I pray that his spirit may continue with us today, henceforth and\nforever; and when the time comes that we shall stand before the Great Judge, where we all\nwill report some day, that we will find our record of such a character that the Lord will say to\nus,\n<\/p><p>\n&ldquo;. . . Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will\nmake thee ruler over many things: Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord&rdquo;\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34014\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34014)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34014)\">Matt. 25:23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that this may be our blessing and the blessing of every soul that we can influence by\nlives of righteousness and worthy example, all of which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, our\nLord. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
