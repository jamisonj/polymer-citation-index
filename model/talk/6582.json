In fact, nearly 90 percent of those who attempt the climb never reach the summit. Temperatures sink lower than 30 degrees below zero. Besides extreme cold, 100-mile-per-hour winds, deadly crevasses, and avalanches, the climber must overcome the challenges of high altitude, lack of oxygen, and perhaps unsanitary food and water. Since 1953, at least 165 climbers have died in the attempt to scale the 29,000-foot-high summit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/one-step-after-another.p10\" class=\"\">In spite of the risks, hundreds line up each year to make the ascent, Erik among them. But there is an important difference between Erik and every other climber who had attempted to ascend before: Erik is totally blind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/one-step-after-another.p11\" class=\"\">When Erik was 13 years of age, he lost his sight as a result of a hereditary disease of the retina. Although he could no longer do many of the things he wanted to, he was determined not to waste his life feeling depressed and useless. He then began to stretch his limits.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/one-step-after-another.p12\" class=\"\">At age 16 he discovered rock climbing. By feeling the face of the rock, he found handholds and footholds that allowed him to climb. Sixteen years later, he began his ascent up Mount Everest. The story of his climb, as you might imagine, was filled with many harrowing and life-threatening challenges. But Erik eventually scaled the south summit and took his place with those who had gone before him, one of the few to stand on top of the highest mountain on the face of the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/one-step-after-another.p13\" class=\"\">When asked how he did it, Erik said, \u201cI just kept thinking \u2026 keep your mind focused. Don\u2019t let all that doubt and fear and frustration sort of get in the way.\u201d Then, most importantly, he said, \u201cJust take each day step by step.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-21911_000_011\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cEverest Grueling for Blind Man,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret News,<\/span> 5 June 2001, A12; see also Karl Taro Greenfeld, \u201cBlind to Failure,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Time,<\/span> 18 June 2001.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/one-step-after-another.p14\" class=\"\">Yes, Erik conquered Everest by simply putting one foot in front of the other.
