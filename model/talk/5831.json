President Brigham Young confirmed, saying, \u201cIt is evident that many who understand the truth do not govern themselves by it; consequently, no matter how true and beautiful truth is, you have to take the passions of the people and mould them to the law of God\u201d (in <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 7:55).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/according-to-the-desire-of-our-hearts.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cDo you,\u201d President Young asked, \u201cthink that people will obey the truth because it is true, unless they love it?

Such education can lead to sanctification until, said President Brigham Young, \u201choly desires produce corresponding outward works\u201d (in <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 6:170).

Once again, we must be honest with ourselves about the consequences of our desires, which follow as the night, the day.
