Hanks, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1968, pp. 115-118<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nLast evening several teenage boys spoke from this pulpit to many thousands of young and\nolder men in a great meeting. I should like to take my theme this morning in part from\nsomething said by one of them: \"If I cannot respect mom and dad, whom I see, how can I\nrespect my Heavenly Father, whom I do not see?\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Infant baptism in error<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTo briefly establish a foundation, let me refer to a recent magazine article which began with\nthese words: \"Infant baptism is under fire.\" There follow several examples of this significant\ntheological development across the world among Protestant and Catholic thinkers, and then\nthis statement: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Perhaps the most formidable challenge to infant baptism was made recently by Switzerland's\nvenerable Karl Barth . . . In his latest book, Barth argues that there is no Biblical basis for\ninfant baptism and that the ritual is not an act of God's grace but a human response to\nit&mdash;which means that the individual must be mature enough to understand the meaning of such a\ndecision. The traditional understanding of the sacrament, he says, is simply 'an old error of\nthe church.'\" (<i>Time<\/i>, May 31, 1968, p. 58.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Of such is the kingdom\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWith the substance of this we are in complete agreement. When the disciples asked Jesus,\n\"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\" the Savior \"called a little child unto him,\nand set him in the midst of them, And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted,\nand become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever\ntherefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of\nheaven\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35840\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35840)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35840)\">Matt. 18:1-4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and\npray: and the disciples rebuked them.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is\nthe kingdom of heaven.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And he laid his hands on them\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35841\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35841)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35841)\">Matt. 19:13-15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo this may be added the testimony of a Book of Mormon prophet: \". . . he that saith that\nlittle children need baptism denieth the mercies of Christ, and setteth at naught the atonement\nof him and the power of his redemption . . . for . . . all little children are alive in Christ\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38349\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38349)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38349)\">Moro. 8:20,22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn other sacred scripture we are taught that infants are \"innocent before God\" and then\nthere is added this signal statement: \"And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and\ntruth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their\nfathers\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15229\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15229)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15229)\">D&amp;C 93:38-39<\/a><\/span>). But, said the Lord, \"I have commanded you to bring up your\nchildren in light and truth\" and to \"set in order your own house\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15234\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15234)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15234)\">D&amp;C 93:40,43<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The tradition of their fathers<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt is to the phrase \"because of the tradition of their fathers\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15231\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15231)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15231)\">D&amp;C 93:39<\/a><\/span>) that I would give special attention\nin these few moments, and to the injunction to \"set in order your own house\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15237\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15237)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15237)\">D&amp;C 93:43<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPreviously over this pulpit I have expressed my respect for children who have improved upon\nthe ways of negligent parents, and my compassion for choice parents who have earnestly tried\nto bring up their children in the way they should go, only to have those children use their\nagency and individuality to follow other ways. The Lord has taught us that in his sight the\nson shall not bear the iniquity of the father; neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the\nson (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23138\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23138)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23138)\">Ezek. 18:20<\/a><\/span>). Each who is accountable must ultimately account for his own decisions.\n<\/p><p>\nBut multitudes of us still have our children at home, or have grandchildren, or are influential\nin the homes or with the children of others. Great numbers of young couples are just starting\ntheir families, or soon will be. All of us should be brought to solemn thoughtfulness by the\nsobering word that although children are \"innocent before God, the wicked one is able to take\naway \"light and truth\" \"through disobedience\" and \"because of the tradition of their fathers\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15230\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15230)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15230)\">D&amp;C 93:38-39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe first definition of \"tradition\" in a modern dictionary is: \"The knowledge, doctrines,\ncustoms, practices, etc., transmitted from generation to generation.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Our traditions<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat is the tradition in your individual home and mine? What \"knowledge, doctrines,\ncustoms, practices,\" and so forth are being or will be transmitted from our generation to our\nchildren and their children?\n<\/p><p>\nGod teaches us that children are to honor their parents (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22785\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22785)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22785)\">Ex. 20:12<\/a><\/span>). What in us, our lives, our character,\nour behavior, is <i>worthy<\/i> of their honor? What in us is noble, responsible, faithful, gracious,\nconsiderate? What is worthy of their respect and their emulation?\n<\/p><p>\nDo we teach honesty by being honest? I love to remember the story of the man who, while\nhis little son was with him, stopped at an isolated cornfield on a remote country road, and\nafter looking before and behind him, to the left and to the right, started to climb the fence to\nappropriate a few ears of the farmer's corn. Said his son: \"Dad, you forgot to look up.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Integrity in the home<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat happens to the boy whose father boasts of the slick deal he has made in which others\nwere outwitted? Years ago the late Joseph Welch said, on the occasion of his being named\nFather of the Year: \n<\/p><p>\n\"If it were in my power to bestow on the youth of the land one single quality, I would not\nchoose, I think, wit or wisdom or even that great boon, education. If I could choose but one, I\nwould choose integrity. If one day my children and grandchildren say to one another, 'He\ntaught us to value integrity,' I shall be content.\n<\/p><p>\n\"How is the quality of integrity passed on to the children in the home? It is passed on by\nliving a <i>life<\/i> of integrity, of sober honesty, of responsible citizenship. How can one surely <i>fail<\/i>\nto pass this priceless quality on to children in the home? By being a little lawless; by being a\nfixer; by being a cheat and a chiseler. Not so long ago one of my two boys spoke these\nsobering words to me. He said, 'When the two of us were young, there were times when you\nand Mom would obviously set out to tell us how to live the good life. We could always\nrecognize those moments and we would close our ears and our minds. Your most influential\nmoments were your most inadvertent ones. We were apt to imitate what you really were not\nwhat you said you were or even what you may have believed you were.\n<\/p><p>\n\"If your children are to have integrity, they must find it in the home and in you. If they live\nin an atmosphere of complete integrity, they will accept it as an attitude and never waver\nthereafter. And having integrity, they will themselves find freedom; and having found it,\ngladly grant it to all others.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Ideals and values<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nEvery parent should ask, What ideals and values is my child learning? What is his image of\nhimself? What is the view of others that he is developing in our home? Is his experience with\nhis parents bringing him a rowing consciousness that the \"bright light of God\" is over\neverything, and a growing confidence in the presence of his Heavenly Father?\n<\/p><p>\nIn New Zealand we learned an old Maori proverb: \"A bird must have feathers to fly.\" Parents\nhave the primary responsibility for feathering our children for flight. A child who lives in an\natmosphere of disrespect, criticism, or shame will not be inclined to respect or accept himself;\nand of shame it has been impellingly written: \"Holocausts are caused not only by atomic\nexplosions. Holocausts are caused wherever a person is put to shame.\" (Abraham J. Herschel,\n<i>The Insecurities of Freedom<\/i>.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Our treatment of others<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOur treatment of others will certainly condition a child's attitude toward others. Children who\nsee and sense in parents a genuine concern for others, expressed in acts of kindness and\ncompassion and unselfishness, will themselves be inclined to think well of mankind and to do\nas the scriptures bid: to \"succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen\nthe feeble knees\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15169\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15169)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15169)\">D&amp;C 81:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYoung people so blessed may also be less susceptible to the bewilderment that confronts some\nin our generation's paradoxical stress on man s rights and privileges while at the same time\nbelittling him as a creature of his environment, conditioned by sociological and psychological\nfactors, not possessing the powers and capacities of free agency, of thinking and believing, of\nchoosing and determining, not the unique personality that God has taught us we are. The\n\"conditioned-reflex\" version of the behaviorist cannot inspire the mystery and awe and wonder\nwhich are the glory of man. To know, instead, that every individual is an eternal person, a\npotential god or goddess, capable of deep love and graciousness and mercy, more than human,\nis to prepare us to live with courage and a sense of responsibility, to inspire self-reliance,\nself-respect, and genuine respect for others.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Tradition of discipline<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat is the tradition of discipline in our homes? Is our child pampered, indulged, permitted in\na moment of crisis to transfer his guilt to others&mdash;his parents, peers, family, the age he lives\nin, society? How will he handle disappointment and failure if he is not taught to face up to\nhis mistakes honestly? We are not talking of imposing senseless punishment. We are talking\nof realities, of facts to be faced, of fair rules which are understood and enforced, with\nsanctions consistently imposed when they are broken. \"Self-respect,\" someone has said, \"is the\nfruit of discipline; the sense of dignity grows with the ability to say NO to one's self.\"\n(Herschel, <i>op. cit.<\/i>)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Other traditions to pass on<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat shall we give to the children? Pray for a sense of humor. \"Laughter leavens life\" and\nbrings a sunny spirit.\n<\/p><p>\nPray also to be able to pass on the will to work, and the urge for excellence; the capacity for\nmoral indignation, and the courage to stand alone; disdain for evil, and love of justice; the\nability to love without condition or question. Do you know the story of the eight-year-old girl\nin an orphanage, unattractive, with annoying mannerisms, disliked by the teachers and\nadministrators? One afternoon it was reported that she had broken a rule that would justify\nher expulsion from the institution. Against regulations she had been seen depositing a note in\na branch of a tree overreaching the fence. The note was retrieved. It read: \"To whoever finds\nthis: I love you.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHow in our home and mine is the tradition of patriotism?\n<\/p><p>\nOn the Saturday evening just before Christmas last year, two clean, handsome young\nmen&mdash;boys, really&mdash;their battle gear stacked nearby, stood before a large group of their comrades at\nChina Beach near DaNang, South Vietnam, and sang \"Silent Night.\" They had no\naccompaniment, and the sweet, clear ring of their voices will always be remembered, and the\nemotion we all felt. The next morning, before dawn, one of those young men came to my\nsleeping quarters to say good-bye and shake hands once more as he joined his outfit to head\nout into the bush on a search-and-destroy mission. It was not the Sabbath activity he would\nhave chosen&mdash;he was disappointed not to be able to worship with fellow servicemen in our\nscheduled meeting&mdash;but he went his way to do his job. There is no question as to the\ntradition transmitted in this boy's home.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Self-control in homes<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFathers, mothers, what tradition are we planting in another generation, in our homes, as to\nself-control&mdash;control of our tongues and tempers and appetites? In 1884 Henry Drummond\nmade a statement on this theme that could be read regularly with profit by each of us: \n<\/p><p>\n\"We are inclined to look upon bad temper as a very harmless weakness. We speak of it as a\nmere infirmity of nature, a family failing, a matter of temperament, not a thing to take into\nvery serious account in estimating a man's character. And yet . . . the Bible again and again\nreturns to condemn it as one of the most destructive elements in human nature.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The peculiarity of ill-temper is that it is the vice of the virtuous. It is often the one blot on\nan otherwise noble character . . . This compatibility of ill-temper with the high moral\ncharacter is one of the strangest and saddest problems of ethics. The truth is, there are two\ngreat classes of sins&mdash;sins of the Body and sins of the Disposition . . . No form of vice, not\nworldliness, not greed of gold, not drunkenness itself, does more to un-Christianize society\nthan evil temper. For embittering life, for breaking up communities, for destroying the most\nsacred relationships, for devastating homes, for withering up men and women, for taking the\nbloom off childhood; in short, for sheer gratuitous misery-producing power, this influence\nstands alone.\" (Henry Drummond: <i>The Greatest Thing in the World<\/i>, pp. 43-46.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Traditions for future homes<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat traditions are we passing on for other homes in future times that are worthy of the\nmemories we ourselves have? On occasion through the years I have enjoyed the blessing of\nasking large groups of adult leaders to meditate for a moment on their conclusion to an\nunfinished sentence, and then share their thoughts. The sentence reads: \"The thing I remember\nbest about my childhood at home with my parents and family is _____________.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI suspect your answers would be about the same as those that I have heard. Never once has\nanyone mentioned a high standard of living, or material possessions. Always they have\nspoken, as I would speak, of attention from mom or dad; of family associations, traditions,\nsacrifices, adventures together; of books read aloud, songs sung, work accomplished; of\nfamily prayers and family councils; of small presents lovingly and unselfishly prepared; of\nhomey and wholesome and happy memories. My single question to them has always been,\nand I ask it today, \"What are we giving our own children that they will remember with equal\njoy and appreciation?\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Tradition of children's song<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSince our last conference my wife and I were privileged to visit Samoa and other islands in\nthe far seas. One afternoon in the mountain tops of Upolu, in American Samoa, in the village\nof Sauniatu, we had a remarkable experience pertinent to this moment. The village was\ndeserted except for a few very young children and one or two who had stayed home with\nthem. The rest were working in the fields or at other tasks. As we walked the single lane of\nSauniatu, between the rows of <i>fal\u00e9s<\/i>, from the monument toward the new chapel and school,\nwe heard children singing. There were perhaps half a dozen of them, none more than four\nyears old, and they were singing with the sweetness of childhood a song we instantly\nrecognized, and stood entranced, in tears, to hear: \"I Am a Child of God.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn that high mountain fastness, at the end of a long, tortuous road, on an island of the sea, we\nfound tiny dark-skinned children, none of them having seen more of the world than their\nsmall village, singing what they had learned through the tradition of their fathers, the greatest\ntruth in existence, save one: I am a child of God.\n<\/p><p>\nThat other truth? That there is a God who hears the voices of his children.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us so to live and to teach that we may bring about a restoration of the home, the\nresurrection of parenthood, that the \"wicked one\" can never take away \"light and truth\" from\nour children \"because of the tradition of their fathers\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15232\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15232)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15232)\">D&amp;C 93:39<\/a><\/span>). In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
