Jesus of Nazareth, with scarcely a three-year ministry among his countrymen, left the home of his friends Mary, Martha, and Lazarus and walked resolutely toward the gates of Jerusalem. Some of the inhabitants of that ancient city considered him to be a blasphemer, a demon, a transgressor of Jewish law. Others believed him to be a prophet, the Messiah, the Son of the living God. Whatever the opinions may have been, all Judea knew of this man who taught with power and authority though he was neither Scribe nor Pharisee.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p4\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the Jews\u2019 passover was nigh at hand:\u201d John records, \u201cand many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cThen sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28787\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28787)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28787)\">John 11:55\u201356<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p6\" class=\"\">Jewish law required the attendance of all adult males at this, the most sacred of Israel\u2019s ceremonial commemorations.

A great multitude went out of Jerusalem to greet him, spreading branches of palm trees before his path and crying: \u201c\u2026 Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. \u2026\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36330\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36330)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36330)\">Matt. 21:9<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p8\" class=\"\">Matthew records that \u201call the city was moved, saying, Who is this?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36331\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36331)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36331)\">Matt. 21:10\u201311<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p10\" class=\"\">To all who had knowledge of the law, this was the triumphant entry of Israel\u2019s king, long predicted by the prophets and long awaited by Israel\u2019s seed.

He spoke in parables of grain that had to die in order to bring forth fruit, and of a chosen son sent by his father into the family vineyard only to be killed as the father\u2019s servants before him had been killed. At times the burden seemed almost too heavy to bear.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cNow is my soul troubled;\u201d he admitted. \u201c\u2026 Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28788\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28788)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28788)\">John 12:27<\/a><\/span>.)

One group of Pharisees and Herodians asked him a most diabolic question:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p17\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cTell us therefore, \u2026 Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36334\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36334)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36334)\">Matt. 22:16\u201317<\/a><\/span>.) If he were to answer yes, he would easily be accused of betraying his heritage among Abraham\u2019s seed, the very group staggering under the oppression of Roman law. If he were to answer no, he would immediately be apprehended as a political agitator. He answered neither, but rather asked to be shown a coin by which such tribute money commonly was paid.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p19\" class=\"\">Holding the piece of money up to his accusers, he asked: \u201cWhose is this image and superscription?\u201d Of course, they answered as any child in the street could have: \u201cIt is Caesar\u2019s.\u201d With that single question he had taken command of the confrontation. He returned the coin saying: \u201c\u2026 Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar\u2019s\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36335\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36335)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36335)\">Matt. 22:20\u201321<\/a><\/span>), as if to say: \u201cThe man\u2019s name and picture are on the coin.

These, too, were sons of God. These, too, were among those he came to save. He feared for them and loved them even in their malice. As they turned away he added a plea: \u201c\u2026 and [render] unto God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d As the coin bore the image of Caesar, so these and all men bore the image of God, their Heavenly Father. They had been created by him in the likeness of his image, and Jesus was to provide a way for them to return to him. Yet, \u201cWhen they heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36336\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36336)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36336)\">Matt. 22:21\u201322<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p21\" class=\"\">A short time later a lawyer baited a theological trap for him, saying: \u201cMaster, which is the great commandment in the law?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36337\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36337)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36337)\">Matt. 22:36<\/a><\/span>.) Legal scholars had divided, subdivided, and categorized the original Mosaic code so minutely that some parts of the law seemed to be in direct opposition to other parts. But Jesus would not be paralyzed by the jots and tittles of legal debate. In a single stroke he penetrated to the heart of the law and integrated those several parts into its one great whole: \u201c\u2026 Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cThis is the first and great commandment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36341\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36341)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36341)\">Matt. 22:37\u201339<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p24\" class=\"\">Again Jesus had turned a question full of venom and envy and technical deceit into an answer of love, compassion, and lofty vision.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p25\" class=\"\">As the final hours of his earthly mission came upon him, Jesus turned away from the multitudes and sought only to strengthen his disciples. He warned them of what lay ahead. He spoke of Jerusalem\u2019s destruction and of the distress and apostasy that would precede his latter-day return to the earth. He spoke of a master who would, after a long time in a distant country, come and make a reckoning with his servants, each according to his ability and the talents given him for investment in a worthy cause. He spoke of a shepherd who would separate his sheep from the goats, the former being those followers who gave meat to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothing to the naked, and attention to the afflicted. He spoke of virgins attending a wedding, some of whom had sufficient oil for trimming their lamps while others saw their meager supply depleted because the bridegroom tarried longer than they supposed. Thus Jesus taught his disciples to watch and pray; however, he taught them that prayerful watching does not require sleepless anxiety and preoccupation with the future, but rather the quiet, steady attention to present duties.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p26\" class=\"\">As the hour of sacrifice approached, Jesus retreated with his twelve apostles to the peace and privacy of an upper chamber. There the Master sought to fortify his special witnesses against the snares of the evil one by laying aside his outer garment, girding himself with a towel, and washing the apostles\u2019 feet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p27\" class=\"\">This magnificent gesture of love and unity was a fitting prelude to the paschal meal that followed. From the time the firstborn of the faithful children of Israel had been \u201cpassed over\u201d in the destruction brought on Egypt by Pharaoh\u2019s intransigence, the Passover meal, with all its symbolic emblems and gestures, had been faithfully observed by Israel\u2019s families. How fitting it was during the observance of this ancient covenant of protection that Jesus should institute the emblems of the new covenant of safety\u2014the emblems of his own body and blood. As he took the bread and broke it, and took the cup and blessed it, he was presenting himself as <span class=\"emphasis\">the<\/span> Lamb of God who would provide spiritual nourishment and eternal salvation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p28\" class=\"\">With the new covenant came a new commandment. Jesus said his disciples must \u201clove one another; as I have loved you. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cBy this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28793\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28793)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28793)\">John 13:34\u201335<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p30\" class=\"\">To the very end of his mortal life Jesus was demonstrating the grandeur of his spirit and the magnitude of his strength. He was not, even at this late hour, selfishly engrossed with his own sorrows or contemplating the impending pain. He was anxiously attending to the present and future needs of his beloved followers. He knew their own safety, individually and as a church, lay only in their unconditional love one for another. His entire energies seem to have been directed toward their needs, thus teaching by example what he was teaching by precept. He gave them words of comfort and commandment and caution.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cLet not your heart be troubled,\u201d he said, for he sensed their fear and sorrow. \u201cIn my father\u2019s house are many mansions. \u2026 I go to prepare a place for you. \u2026 I am the way, the truth, and the life. \u2026 Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do. \u2026 I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever. \u2026 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. \u2026 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. \u2026 These things I command you, that ye love one another.\u201d (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"28795\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28795)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28795)\">John 14:1\u20132,6,13,16,18<\/a><\/span> and <span class=\"citation\" id=\"28810\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28810)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28810)\">John 15:14,17<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p32\" class=\"\">On this night of nights, as the little group approached the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus might have asked his apostles to pray for him, to strengthen him for the unutterable task ahead.

Jesus of Nazareth was now Jesus the Christ; he had conquered death.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p38\" class=\"\">In contrast to the haste and busy affairs of our day, his life was one of simplicity. He lived in humble circumstances. He had not surrounded himself with the proud and mighty of the earth, but with the poor, the humble, and those of modest circumstances. There was nothing complicated about his life or teaching. The words he spoke relate to people of all walks of life\u2014to all those who listened in his day and to all those who will listen today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/his-final-hours.p39\" class=\"\">History bears well the burden of providing ample evidence of his death.
