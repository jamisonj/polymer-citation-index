I feel\nkeenly the responsibility in addressing this great body of the priesthood of the Lord Jesus\nChrist.\n<\/p><p>\nHOSPITALITY FOR WARD TEACHERS\n<\/p><p>\nLast night in our bishops' meeting, we discussed the great priesthood activity of ward\nteaching. There was one factor omitted that I should like to draw to your attention, and that is\nthe manner of receiving the ward teachers in our homes, Reports have come to us that in\nmany homes there is an attitude of indifference. Perhaps the radio is on, or the television, and\nthe proper hospitality is not accorded the servants of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nWe plead with you bishops, to admonish your people to receive these servants of God with\nkindness and consideration. I recall about two years ago of visiting the home of President J.\nReuben Clark, and as I left, there was a humble man at the door. I heard the president say to\nhim, \"What can I do for you, my brother?\" And he introduced himself as the ward teacher. I\nwas deeply impressed by the degree of hospitality that a member of the First Presidency\nextended to this humble man. I wish that all of us could have the same attitude and feeling\ntowards these men that are sent to us as representatives of the bishop; extending to them the\nhighest degree of cordiality, call the family in, and hearken and listen to their instructions.\n<\/p><p>\nAbout a week ago I was asked this question: Are the general authorities assigned subjects to\ndiscuss in general conference? My answer was \"No.\" The individual who was asking the\nquestion said, \"It seems rather odd that in all of the general conferences there is a definite\ntheme discussed by the general authorities.\" And so during this great conference I could not\nhelp but observe that after Brother Romney gave his wonderful address pointing out the\ndangers and the feeling of insecurity, almost every speaker following him talked on that\nparticular subject. And that subject is on my mind tonight.\n<\/p><p>\nSECURITY THROUGH THE GOSPEL\n<\/p><p>\nThe other day a sixteen-year-old boy was heard to make this declaration, \"I wonder what kind\nof a tomorrow there will be for me. When I am eighteen or nineteen, no doubt I will be\ndrafted into the armed forces, which will mean a service of at least two years, and if there is\nwar, it may mean an indefinite period of service.\" \"And after that, if I'm lucky enough to\ncome out, I want to go on a mission, and have four years at college. By the time I've done all\nof these things, I'll be twenty-seven or twenty-eight years of age.\" He seemed to express a\nspirit of frustration. He was down-hearted and discouraged because of an uncertain future.\n<\/p><p>\nI believe that we can so instruct our youth that regardless of what events transpire in the\nworld's history, there will be in their hearts a feeling of security, security given to them\nthrough a testimony of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm sure that our youth will\nunderstand the gospel more fully if there is gospel instruction in the home, for has not the\nLord declared: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion or in any of her stakes which\nare organized, and teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in\nChrist, the son of the living God, and of baptism, and of the gift of the Holy Ghost by\nthe laying on of hands when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.\nFor this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion or in any of her stakes which are\norganized. And their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins when\neight years old and receive the laying on of hands. And they shall also teach their\nchildren to pray and to walk uprightly before the Lord\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12902\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12902)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12902)\">D&amp;C 68:25-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nINSTRUCTION OF CHILDREN\n<\/p><p>\nI wonder when a child is approaching the age of eight, whether or not the head of the family,\nthe father, he who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood, calls his child to his side and gives him\nsome instruction with reference to having faith in the Lord Jesus Christ explaining to him\nwhat repentance means, the great significance of the baptismal ordinance, wherein having\nbeen baptized their sins are remitted, and the great significant fact that when they go into the\nwaters of baptism, they are buried with the Christ in death, coming up out of the water is\nsymbolical of His resurrection. I do not feel that these teachings are beyond the understanding\nof a child eight years old.\n<\/p><p>\nI am certain that a child of eight years of age will understand the significance of the laying on\nof hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. If a child has been properly taught and has a proper\nconcept of the Godhead, he will know that there is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost in\nthe Godhead. And this great spiritual being, called the Holy Ghost, can be so explained to a\nchild that he will understand what the Holy Ghost is. And along with that, teach him that\nwhen the authorized servants of God lay their hands upon his head, that individual so laying\nhis hands upon his head has the authority to do so&mdash;restored authority in these the last days.\nAnd through the imposition of hands and receiving the promise of the gift of the Holy Ghost,\nif that child is taught to live a sweet, clean life, the Holy Ghost will come and be his\ncompanion. I think he can understand that he will be led into the path of truth and light, that\nhe will be blessed with a sense of perception which will give him the power to differentiate\nbetween that which is good and that which is evil. I think it would be an excellent practice to\nread to children the scripture wherein the Savior declared; found in John 14:16-17, including\nverse 26,\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter that he might\nabide with you forever, even the spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive\nbecause it seeketh him not, neither knoweth him. But ye know him, for he dwelleth\nwith you and shall be in you, But the comforter which is the Holy Ghost, whom the\nFather will send in my name shall teach you all things and bring all things to your\nremembrance whatsoever I have said unto you\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27498\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27498)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27498)\">John 14:16-17,26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf children who are about to be baptized receive these instructions, they will understand the\nsignificance of them, creating a desire to live so fine the Spirit of Truth will come into their\nsouls, giving them the assurance, yes, more than that, the testimony that their Heavenly Father\nlives and that the boy of Nazareth was his son, the Redeemer of the world; and that a\nfourteen-year old boy who went into the woods asking for divine guidance, was visited by the\nFather and the Son, his prayers were answered\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30302\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30302)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30302)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>),\nand they, too, can have their prayers\nanswered. The Holy Ghost will give them a blessing of security as to the future and the\neternities, that regardless of what events transpire, they will understand that their Heavenly\nFather rules over all for good.\n<\/p><p>\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRIESTHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nThen there comes the time when worthy young men at the age of twelve receive the\npriesthood of God. I do not know of anyone who is better qualified to sit down with his son\nthan a father and explain to him the great significance of the priesthood. Define priesthood:\nPoint out to him that when he receives the priesthood of God, there is bestowed upon him\nGodly power that gives him the right to represent the Lord and to function in certain\nassignments when called upon to do so by those in authority. If these important lessons with\nrelationship to the priesthood were taught to our sons, these young men would have a higher\nregard and respect for the priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nThink if you will of the wonderful relationship in the home, when a father holding the\nMelchizedek Priesthood instructs his son in the ways of the priesthood who holds the lower or\nthe Aaronic Priesthood. The Aaronic Priesthood is an appendage to the Melchizedek or the\nhigher priesthood (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12929\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12929)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12929)\">D&amp;C 107:4<\/a><\/span>),\njust as a son is an appendage to his father. I feel that if in our homes\nfathers will take the time to teach these young men what the priesthood means&mdash;its\nsignificance, its powers, what is expected of them who hold it, it will contribute to the feeling\nof security that youth is seeking for. If fathers and mothers invite their sons and daughters to\nattend Sacrament Meeting with them, the sacrament meeting will become such a sacred, such\na solemn, and such an impressive meeting that young people would not miss it. Partaking of\nthe emblems of the Last Supper should be a source of inspiration and comfort to them, and\nthe obligations they make with the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung people should always feel impressed with the fact that Joseph Smith actually saw the\nFather and the Son just as plainly as I can see you\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30303\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30303)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30303)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\nIt had to be so for the world to know\nwhat our Heavenly Father is like and that Jesus Christ is his son.\n<\/p><p>\nThen, too, if as fathers and mothers, we are carrying out the mandate of the Lord wherein he\nhas given us instructions to teach our youth the gospel, please invite our youth to attend fast\nmeeting, teaching them first the significance of the fast offering principle, that they abstain\nfrom two meals, giving the equivalent in cash to a member of the Aaronic Priesthood who\ncomes to collect it for the bishop impressing upon them that their contribution will be used\nfor those who are in distress.\n<\/p><p>\nFIRST GREAT COMMANDMENT\n<\/p><p>\nAll during this conference, and particularly during the funeral of President Smith today, the\nfirst and great commandment was referred to many times&mdash;first, to love the Lord our God\nwith all our might, and secondly to love our neighbor as ourself\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34481\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34481)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34481)\">Matt. 27:37-39<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33045\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33045)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33045)\">Mark 12:28-31<\/a><\/span>).\nTeach the youth of Israel to\nlove their neighbors as themselves, then they must do something for that neighbor. Teach\nthem that whatever they contribute in fast offerings is expressing a real love for the widow,\nfor the aged, and for the orphan. Love, after all, is something that creates and demands\nservice. It isn't lip service, but service that goes for the benefit and the good of someone else.\nTeaching our children to observe the fast offering principle, contributing to those who are in\nneed, inviting them to attend fast meeting with the promise that if they will stand and bear\nwitness that God lives and his goodness unto them, God will reward them with a testimony.\nThe spirit of testimony only comes through the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost, and if\nthey desire to experience the power of the Holy Ghost, the place to go to have that experience\nis in the fast meeting.\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure there isn't a young man or young woman that bears testimony to the divine\nexistence of God, but what they feel in their souls something that is far above themselves, and\nit is a gift, the gift of the Holy Ghost. Brigham Young declared that no man can testify only\nthrough the power and the gift of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, so through\nobserving the fast offering principle and attending fast meeting there will come to them\nspiritual rewards which will bud into a testimony.\n<\/p><p>\nIMPORTANCE OF PRAYER\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has admonished us to teach our children to pray. If they're not introduced to the\nLord in the family circle of prayer, they will not know him. And knowing him not, they will\nnot have faith. So one of the first and most important lessons in every Latter-day Saint home\nshould be teaching our children to pray. I am convinced that every spirit that leaves the\npresence of God and comes into mortality has a spark of faith in its heart. Hence the\nresponsibility devolves upon the parents to so teach the children that the gospel spark will\nburst into a flame of faith. Having faith through prayer and obedience they will understand\nthe gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and let come what will, they will know that God lives,\nthat he will be with them, bless them, and sustain them. And I know that any individual who\nhas a testimony of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, as Brother Romney indicated\nyesterday, will have a feeling of security, will have a positive, affirmative feeling and not a\nnegative one in spite of all the terrible events that are transpiring at this time.\n<\/p><p>\nIf the young of Israel will live the gospel they will know what the old prophet Joel said\nwould be a reality: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and\nyour sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams and\nyour young men shall see visions, and also upon the servants and upon the\nhandmaidens in those days I will pour out my spirit\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26870\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26870)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26870)\">Joel 2:28-29<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then again the Lord has said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore children shall grow up until they become old. Old men shall die but they\nshall not sleep in the dust, but they shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12896\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12896)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12896)\">D&amp;C 63:51<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPROMISES OF THE LORD\n<\/p><p>\nWith a burning testimony in their hearts, there isn't any question but that the youth of Israel\nwill accept the word of the Lord at its face value, and with the promises involved, why\nshould they be downcast or why should they ask the question, \"Will there be a tomorrow;\"\nThere will be a tomorrow for them, not only tomorrows of mortality but tomorrows of\neternity, where they will enjoy every blessing that the Lord has promised the faithful, the\nloyal, and the devoted. For has not the Lord declared: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And in that day the enmity of man and the enmity of beasts, yea the enmity of all\nflesh shall cease from before my face\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12927\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12927)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12927)\">D&amp;C 101:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFor in the day when enmity between man and beast and between man and man ceases, we\nshall have eternal peace.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd after we have taught our youth the gospel principles and in turn they have obeyed them,\nmight they well feel as Paul declared to Timothy in 2 Timothy 1:7,\n<\/p><p>\n\"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a\nsound mind\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5111\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5111)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5111)\">2 Tim. 1:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPaul declared to the Corinthians, in 1 Corinthians 16:13: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit ye like men. Be strong\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"210\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 210)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(210)\">1 Cor. 16:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the strong people will be the Saints of God, who have lived his word, and kept his\ncommandments. Finally, when these young people stand upon the heights of their tomorrow,\nas Joshua stood upon the heights of the promised land and looking upon it for the first time,\nmay our young men hear that sweet, small voice which said to him: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Only be thou strong and of good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for\nthe Eternal One is with thee whithersoever thou goest\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30043\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30043)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30043)\">Josh. 1:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd in response to that voice, they will declare: \n<\/p><p>\nI'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord, over mountain or plain or sea,<br \/>\nI'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord<br \/>\nI'll be what you want me to be.\n<\/p><p>\nFathers of Israel, teach your children the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ in their childhood,\nand when they are old they will not depart therefrom\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41405\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41405)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41405)\">Prov. 22:6<\/a><\/span>), and may the feeling of security and\ntestimony come into their hearts in the place of fear and doubt knowing the Lord lives and\nthis is his work, which I humbly ask will be the blessing of every young man and woman in\nIsrael, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
