Not only so, but to make restitution, so far as it is possible, for all the wrongs we have done, to pay our debts, and restore to God and man their rights\u2014that which is due to them from us. This is true repentance, and the exercise of the will and all the powers of body and mind is demanded, to complete this glorious work of repentance; [only] then God will accept it.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Doctrine, <\/span>p. 123.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/there-is-need-for-repentance.p14\" class=\"\">If one truly repents, it will be manifested by his works, for, \u201cBy this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins \u2014behold, he will confess them and forsake them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16092\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16092)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16092)\">D&amp;C 58:43<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/there-is-need-for-repentance.p15\" class=\"\">Thus repentance calls for a heartfelt sorrow for sin resulting not only in a cessation thereof but also in reformation of life.

For a while he did well as far as the Church and his activities were concerned; and amazingly, even without the abundant rainfall and the water and the resources, he began to thrive again. He accumulated wealth again. He became so interested and involved in his possessions that he forgot about the purpose of his coming to America. They waited upon him as ward teachers. The bishop would call upon him and implore him to become active as he used to be, and he would promise them that in the future when he got certain things settled that he would do it. Finally he was growing old, and they came and said to him, \u201cNow, Lars, the Lord was good to you when you were in Denmark. He has been good to you since you have come here.
