Many times we have laughed; cried; shared feelings, hopes, and dreams; sorted out differences; solved the problems of the world; and recognized our strengths and weaknesses into the wee hours of the morning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p5\" class=\"\">I suppose that some of you are asking, \u201cWhat does the Wright family\u2019s kitchen table have to do with this talk?\u201d Nothing! I just wish we all could be surrounding it right now. It certainly would be more comfortable for me. Then we could reflect with one another, share our ideas and feelings, and come to some conclusions together. Since we can\u2019t do that, I invite you to mentally sit at my kitchen table as I share with you some of my thoughts and ideas.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p6\" class=\"\">I am grateful for the beautiful message we have just heard from the choir. I too feel our Savior\u2019s love. His spirit warms my soul. I have been encircled with his love and recognize the blessings he has given me. It is my desire to follow him as I strive to serve him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p7\" class=\"\">One way we can feel Christ\u2019s love is through the example of others as they emulate his life. My grandfather Broadbent was such a man. He taught by example. He never sent his ten children out to work without his working with them, side by side.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p8\" class=\"\">He showed my father how to dig postholes by making a game of it. They would race with one another to see who could finish the task first. He subscribed to the principle that once a job was begun, it was done well, and it was finished. Not only did he work hard, he was committed to living the gospel well. He accepted the gospel plan without question. When it was time for tithing settlement, the whole family attended and accounted for their increase. He sent his sons on missions when there was no money during the Depression. He loved the Lord and his word. I remember countless times as a teenager visiting him in his home. There I would see him seated in his black leather chair reading the scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p9\" class=\"\">He was devoted to his family and loved to have us meet together often. At the end of these family gatherings he would call us together and talk with us. No matter what else he said, he always told us the most important things in life were the family and the gospel. He bore a strong witness of the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, told us that he loved us and that Heavenly Father loved us, too. There was no doubt in my mind he was telling us the truth. His legacy has been perpetuated. Although he died before I was married, my children know him as a man who loved the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p10\" class=\"\">When I was a young child, my grandmother Richards lived in the upstairs bedroom of our home. Although she was in her nineties and failing in health, her mind was alert, and her hands spent most of the day crocheting trim around flannel baby blankets. Grandma was such a part of our lives that I can\u2019t ever remember her not being in our home. She was very patient. My younger brother, Rich, and I spent many hours taking Grandma \u201cfor pretend rides\u201d in her hospital bed. The crank at the foot of the bed could be rotated so that the head or the foot could be raised or lowered. When she was resting, we would come into her room and ask her if we could crank her up or down. Once, when we tired of this game, we ran off to play, leaving Grandma with both her head and her feet in the air in a \u201cV\u201d position.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p11\" class=\"\">She never scolded us for doing this, nor would she allow our mother to, either. She understood that we were children. She simply picked up the gold bell by her side and rang it until one of our older sisters or parents came to her rescue.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p12\" class=\"\">Every evening, rocking in her chair, she would call us to her side and ask that we say our prayers with her. She taught us a sweet little verse which we would repeat: \u201cNow I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.\u201d Afterward we offered our individual prayers to Heavenly Father. She would listen carefully and tell us that she loved us. Through her example, she taught me about patience. She taught me about prayer. She taught me about love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p13\" class=\"\">In Timothy, we are admonished to be an example of the believers. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"2895\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2895)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2895)\">1 Tim. 4:12<\/a><\/span>.) A believer is someone who follows and knows the teachings of Christ not only in his mind but also in his heart and whose actions are a witness of that belief. It isn\u2019t easy to be an example of the believers. We don\u2019t usually wake up in the morning and say, \u201cToday I\u2019m going to be an example of the believers!\u201d Yet we can say, \u201cToday I will be kind and thoughtful, or considerate, or honest, or whatever quality I need to work on.\u201d And <span class=\"emphasis\">then<\/span> we will try hard all day to make a conscious effort to do so. That we can do!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p14\" class=\"\">We can live in such a way that people can look to us as their examples.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p15\" class=\"\">To be a good example of a principle, we must not only understand it but we must live that principle. It should become such a part of our everyday living that without consciously thinking about it, the principle is reflected in the way we live.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p16\" class=\"\">Children are especially sensitive to the power of pure example. Ten-year-old Andrea stood at the pulpit. Her dark eyes looked around the room. She took a deep breath and began, \u201cI would like to tell you about some people that I love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cI love my older sister, Amy.

She is a good big sister.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cMy aunt Elaine is a cheerful mother. She wants everyone to be happy. She shows concern and love for others. I want to be just like her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cGrandma always has time for me.

She is kind and loving and always wants to make things fair.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p20\" class=\"\">Andrea\u2019s sister, aunt, and grandmother each lived Christlike principles in such a way that Andrea was drawn to them. She felt cherished and loved when she was with them; therefore, she wanted to be like them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p21\" class=\"\">I believe we are drawn to those who make us feel good about ourselves when we are with them. The desire to be like them follows naturally.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p22\" class=\"\">To be true examples of believers, we are first committed inwardly to the principle of Christ that our actions reflect. For example, if we are dedicated to the principle of family prayer, we as parents pray regularly with our family. Hopefully, our children will recognize our devotion and dependence on prayer and pattern their prayers after this example.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p23\" class=\"\">The song \u201cLove Is Spoken Here\u201d shows the strength of a mother\u2019s prayer as seen by her child.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I see my mother kneeling with our family each day.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I hear the words she whispers as she bows her head to pray.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Her plea to the Father quiets all my fears,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And I am thankful love is spoken here.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p28\" class=\"\">(<span class=\"emphasis\">Children\u2019s Songbook,<\/span> 190\u201391.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p29\" class=\"\">Because of a mother\u2019s example, a child feels at peace while participating in family prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p30\" class=\"\">It is interesting to note that we choose the examples we follow. We exercise our own agency through our choices. Examples are not forced upon us. We choose which ones we want to emulate and which ones we want to ignore or disregard. The choice is ours, and so is the burden of the consequence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p31\" class=\"\">Throughout the beginning pages of the Book of Mormon, we are reminded that Nephi believed the words of his father and used his agency to follow Lehi\u2019s righteous example. Laman and Lemuel thought their father was foolish; they rebelled and murmured against him. They chose not to follow their father\u2019s teachings. The results of Nephi, Laman, and Lemuel\u2019s decisions are evident. Nephi was blessed with the Spirit of the Lord. Laman and Lemuel lived lives of despair. And yet the decision was theirs, to choose for themselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p32\" class=\"\">Our beloved prophet, Ezra Taft Benson, a living example of the believers, said, \u201cThe proper example is all-important. <span class=\"emphasis\">Let us be what we profess to be.<\/span> There is no satisfactory substitute.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Improvement Era,<\/span> Aug. 1948, p. 494; italics added.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-thou-an-example.p33\" class=\"\">We can always feel secure in looking to Christ as our perfect example.
