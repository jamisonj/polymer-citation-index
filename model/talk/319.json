It has been a time of pleasure and recreation, and\nI am satisfied that had our pioneer forebears been here they too would have gladly joined with\nus. The year is passing now, and the centuries are before us. The best tribute that we who are\nmembers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints can pay to those who are on the\nother side will be to honor God and keep his commandments and by so doing honor those\nwhose names we bear. In this way we will increase our own happiness and provide\nopportunity for joy for those who follow after US.\n<\/p><p>\nOUR GREAT RESPONSIBILITY\n<\/p><p>\nWe will receive the blessings of the Lord if we will only remember that since we are the\nchildren of God, our responsibility is greater than any other people. No other church has the\nresponsibility that is upon this Church because the Lord has given to us a commandment to\ngo into all the world and preach the gospel unto every creature\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33013\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33013)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33013)\">Mark 16:15<\/a><\/span>) so that\n<\/p><p>\nHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33015\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33015)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33015)\">Mark 16:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo it is not merely a question of living our short lives in comfort; if we expect to enjoy\neternal happiness in the celestial kingdom, we must earn it by doing our best to bring as many\nof our Father's children to live with him as we possibly can.\n<\/p><p>\nGod has been good to us. No people in the world have more reason to be grateful than we.\nHere under the shelter of this roof we can well pour out our souls to him who is the Author\nof our being and remember with love those, who under his watchcare, made it possible for us\nto enjoy the things that we now have.\n<\/p><p>\nMANIFESTO ISSUED\n<\/p><p>\nOn October 6, 1890, in this Tabernacle the people were assembled in conference. The Church\nhad been harassed and abused, and property had been escheated by the government. Many had\nbeen imprisoned for what they believed. Upon that occasion the President of the Church,\nWilford Woodruff, among other things, delivered this message to us here:\n<\/p><p>\nInasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages,\nwhich laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of last resort, I\nhereby declare my intention to submit to those laws, and to use my influence with\nthe members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41172\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41172)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41172)\">O.D. 1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat is a part of the Manifesto,\n<\/p><p>\nAfter that had been read, Lorenzo Snow, the man who later succeeded Wilford Woodruff as\nPresident of the Church, said:\n<\/p><p>\nI move that, recognizing Wilford Woodruff as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints, and the only man on the earth at the present time who holds the keys of the\nsealing ordinances, we consider him fully authorized by virtue of his position to issue the\nManifesto which has been read in our hearing and which is dated September 24th, 1890, and\nthat as a Church in General Conference assembled, we accept his declaration concerning\nplural marriages as authoritative and binding.\n<\/p><p>\nThe vote to sustain the foregoing motion was unanimous.\n<\/p><p>\nPRACTICE OF PLURAL MARRIAGE DISCONTINUED\n<\/p><p>\nThat was the action of the Church at that time. The practice of plural marriage ceased because\nthe government of the United States forbade it. Our Heavenly Father has always directed that\nwe sustain the constitutional law of the land, and the Supreme Court being the highest\nauthority had declared the law forbidding plural marriage was constitutional.\n<\/p><p>\nFrom then until now, there has been little said by us, and now, after all these years, I would\nlike to say that from that time on, approximately fifty years, there have been no plural\nmarriages solemnized in violation of the laws of this land by the Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nMANIFESTO STILL BINDING\n<\/p><p>\nI mention this because, unfortunately, there are some people in the world who are still\ninsisting that we no longer pay attention to the Manifesto, that it does not bind us now, and\nby that attitude some men and women are falling into adultery and committing a sin not only\nagainst the government of the United States, but also against the Church itself. And yet they\nsay that because we are not talking about it, that we condone it.\n<\/p><p>\nAs President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I say we do not condone it.\nWe desire our people to obey the law of the land in reference to marriage. If you hear\nanybody say that the leadership of the Church is not in harmony with the Manifesto of\nWilford Woodruff as sustained by the Church, then you may know that he is mistaken.\n<\/p><p>\nI regret that it is necessary to refer to this matter, but there are those who are going among\nthe people encouraging the violation of the moral law. That is what they are doing, and if the\nChurch of Jesus Christ stands for anything, it stands for morality, and so today, in the\nconclusion of this conference, I call your attention to this matter.\n<\/p><p>\nA BLESSED PEOPLE\n<\/p><p>\nNo people in the world are more greatly blessed than we. It is marvelous what our Heavenly\nFather has done for us. The Church grows, increases, and becomes stronger as the days come\nand go.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are permitted twice a year to assemble in this great building in a general conference and\nmeet as we have been during the last three days to be instructed by our brethren. Here under\nthe influence of the Spirit of the Lord we are taught to observe the laws of the land and to\nkeep the commandments of our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nNow today I think we have reason to be grateful. There is trouble ahead. The world is sick\nand in a pitiable condition, and until the people repent of their sins and return to the true and\nliving God, there will be no peace that will be worthy of the name. It is our duty to set the\nexample; it is our duty to hold aloft the banner of truth. It is our duty to encourage our\nFather's other children to listen to his advice and counsel and so adjust things that wherever\nwe are we will find the spirit of God burning in our souls and our influence will be for good.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that we may continue faithful. I congratulate those of you who are able to attend the\nconference at this time. I feel to bless the choir which has rendered such splendid music and\nthe Relief Society Singing Mothers and others who have sung for us. I am grateful to them\nand I pray the Lord to bless them and bless us all that we may be worthy not only to be\nmembers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but also that we may be worthy\nto be called sons and daughters of the Living God, and seek to do his will and keep his\ncommandments.\n<\/p><p>\nTESTIMONY\n<\/p><p>\nGod lives. Jesus is the Christ. The land that we live upon, in all parts of this earth, belongs to\nhim. We are only tenants here. He places us here with the opportunity to prepare ourselves for\neternal happiness and promises us that in due time this world shall become a celestial\nkingdom (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12411\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12411)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12411)\">D&amp;C 130:9<\/a><\/span>).\nHow wonderful it is for us to know that we have a chance to earn our place in that\nkingdom by following the advice and counsel that he gives us. If we\ncontinue to do that, happiness, satisfaction, and joy will be our reward.\n<\/p><p>\nI know that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ. I know that Joseph Smith was a\nProphet of the Living God, and that the gospel of our Lord is upon the earth. The power and\nauthority of the priesthood are here, and if we will observe the advice that has been given to\nus, if we will honor him, who is the Author of our being, not only we but our children and\nchildren's children will also be among those whom God will bless throughout eternity. That is\nmy testimony, and I bear that witness to you this day in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
