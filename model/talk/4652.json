The general tendency, of course, is to try to avoid it. From time immemorial, the dream has been to extend life indefinitely. There have been potions and elixirs which would supposedly protect a person from death. Legends of the fountain of youth have led men to the ends of the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-quality-of-eternal-life.p5\" class=\"\">Things are not so different today.

The end result, however, is that we die anyway. From Adam to Abraham, from Peter and Paul to Henry VIII, George Washington and the rest\u2014all have departed with their generations, and so will we.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-quality-of-eternal-life.p8\" class=\"\">Where did they go, this countless flowering of humanity?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-quality-of-eternal-life.p9\" class=\"\">Is there a purpose in such a temporary existence?

I hope he was happy about it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-quality-of-eternal-life.p13\" class=\"\">Now, in view of the almost universal concern over the quality of <span class=\"emphasis\">mortal<\/span> life, and since some people seem to be happier than others, we might ask the question about <span class=\"emphasis\">eternal<\/span> life: \u201cHow can I be sure to have a happy experience there?\u201d And remember, eternity is a long, long time. Well, you can listen to those who know about it. Atheists don\u2019t know about it. Careless, worldly, materialistic people don\u2019t know about it or, at best, they are unconcerned.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-quality-of-eternal-life.p14\" class=\"\">Who does know? Well, God knows. He is the Eternal Father. And Christ knows. He controls the plan which can bring the quality of happiness. And his prophets know. And so do those who listen to the prophets and understand the scriptures. Even in the Church the doctrine of eternal life is not always well understood or appreciated. If it were, many members would do more about it. After all, the quality of that eternal existence is in our own hands.
