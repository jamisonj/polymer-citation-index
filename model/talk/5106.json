When a worthy priesthood bearer is led to pronounce specific blessings, we can be greatly comforted. Yet there is no guarantee of outcome without effort on our part. Appropriate use of priesthood authority opens a channel of help where the outcome is consistent with the will of the Lord. The blessing resolves those things which are beyond our own capacity to influence either personally or with the help of others. Yet we must do our part for the blessing to be realized. We must strive to be worthy and to exercise the requisite faith to do what we are able. Where it is intended that others help, we must use that help also. It is through the combination of our doing what is within our power to accomplish and the power of the Lord that the blessing is realized.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/obtaining-help-from-the-lord.p28\" class=\"\">Once I was awakened by a call from an anxious mother.

One never feels completely worthy, but we must do our best to be so. There came a strong prompting to bless the child to recover. The worthy mother continued professional treatment and exercised her faith. The Lord responded with the additional blessing needed. And the child recovered.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/obtaining-help-from-the-lord.p29\" class=\"\">A relative asked Elder Spencer W. Kimball for a blessing to combat a crippling disease.

The medical forecast was grim. If he survived, he could spend the rest of his life completely paralyzed. Recently I met him again. Through the priesthood, he had been blessed to gain the mobility needed to do all the Lord intended he do in life. He moved his electric cart near, shook my hand, sat upright, and broke into a broad grin. The room was charged with his invincible spirit. His faith\u2014and incredibly hard, painful effort, sustained and magnified by the blessing of the Lord\u2014has begun a miracle. With periodic help from loving friends, he is succeeding in a university and striving to progress to qualify to be a missionary. I know his continued effort will yield far greater improvement.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/obtaining-help-from-the-lord.p34\" class=\"\">In striking contrast, consider another man.

As we spoke, it was obvious he was not doing the most fundamental things to qualify to find a wife. He admitted that maybe he should do something about his excessive weight, but that was hard. His clothes were slovenly and his body so neglected that it was difficult to stand near him. Clearly, he is not doing his part.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/obtaining-help-from-the-lord.p35\" class=\"\">Help from the Lord generally comes in increments. He can immediately cure serious illnesses or disabilities or even allow the dead to be raised. But the general pattern is that improvement comes in sequential steps. That plan gives us an opportunity to discover what the Lord expects us to learn. It requires our patience to recognize His timetable. It provides growth from our efforts and trust in Him and the opportunity to express gratitude for the help given.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/obtaining-help-from-the-lord.p36\" class=\"\">Often we have difficulty mastering lessons the Lord wants us to learn when things are going too well in our lives. When there is suffering or pain, we ask ourselves a lot of questions. Some of them ought to be: What does the Lord want me to learn from this experience? What do I need to do? What do I need to change? Whom do I need to serve? Or what characteristic must I improve? Pondering and prayer will help us understand what we are to learn from the challenges we are asked to overcome.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/obtaining-help-from-the-lord.p37\" class=\"\">Not all our prayers will be answered as we wish. It is not always easy to know the will of the Lord, yet there are some things we can be certain of. He will never ask us to do anything that is not completely in harmony with His teachings.

One who prays to know if another is to be the eternal companion while violating in any degree the law of chastity has little hope of receiving confirmation without repentance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/obtaining-help-from-the-lord.p38\" class=\"\">\u201cFor behold, the Lord hath said: I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling block before them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40813\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40813)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40813)\">Mosiah 7:29<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/obtaining-help-from-the-lord.p39\" class=\"\">\u201cBut if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, \u2026 he will \u2026 deliver you out of bondage.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40814\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40814)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40814)\">Mosiah 7:33<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/obtaining-help-from-the-lord.p40\" class=\"\">Our earnest prayers are answered when they conform to the will of the Lord.

His will is our best choice in life, whether or not we fully understand it.

Such experiences, honorably met, prepare you and condition you for yet greater blessings. As your Father, His purpose is your eternal happiness, your continuing development, your increasing capacity. His desire is to share with you all that He has. The path you are to walk through life may be very different from others. You may not always know why He does what He does, but you can know that He is perfectly just and perfectly merciful.
