The testimony received and carried within us enables us to hold a steady course in times of prosperity and to overcome doubt and fear in times of adversity. Each of us needs to know what a testimony is, how we can get it, and what our responsibilities are once we have received a testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p7\" class=\"\">A testimony is the spirit of prophecy (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"42590\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42590)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42590)\">Rev. 19:10<\/a><\/span>). It is a personal revelation from God, revealing the truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Our testimony provides a guiding light that leads to a commitment which directs our conduct and our way of life. Our testimony is true north on a spiritual compass. It is a moving force that cannot be seen but can truly be felt. It is a burning within that tells us what is right. It is when \u201cyour heart tells you things your mind doesn\u2019t know\u201d (Harold B.

Faith is testimony; testimony is faith. Having a strong testimony allows us to help others in their search for truth. Our testimony is a gift from God. It should be shared, but we do not have the authority to bestow a testimony upon someone else, because a personal testimony is granted by the Holy Ghost. It can aid others in gaining knowledge for themselves\u2014a knowledge abiding in the heart that leaves no room for doubt.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p11\" class=\"\">Our testimony is a knowledge of who we are\u2014a child of God, where we came from\u2014the presence of our Heavenly Father, and where we are going eternally if we are faithful\u2014back into the presence of our Heavenly Father. We must each gain such a testimony if we are to withstand the trials and adversities of mortality and go on to the glorious eternal future we all desire.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p12\" class=\"\">Today we rejoice in sustaining a new President of the Church.

We learn that a testimony is very personal. We can each gain a testimony of the truth through the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p15\" class=\"\">Fourteen men have presided over The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in this dispensation. Every one of them has had an unshakable testimony of the reality of God, the divine sonship of Jesus Christ, the truth of the gospel, the Book of Mormon, and the calling of the Prophet Joseph Smith. How did they receive their testimonies? Can we obtain a testimony in the same way?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p16\" class=\"\">We are familiar with the vision received by the Prophet Joseph Smith and how he obtained his testimony of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. Joseph had serious reflection about religions of his time. He read in the scriptures that if he lacked wisdom, he could ask of God, and wisdom would be given to him. The passage of scripture found in <span class=\"citation\" id=\"26394\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26394)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26394)\">James 1:5<\/a><\/span> came to his heart with great power and feeling. Joseph reflected on the scripture again and again. He retired to the woods to express in humble prayer the desire of his heart, to do as James directed\u2014to ask of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p17\" class=\"\">As we humbly testify to the world, there appeared to Joseph in answer to his prayer the very Eternal God of heaven and earth and his Only Begotten Son, who is the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. They appeared to this young man, who in the eyes of the world seemed to be a common lad, revealing in a few brief moments more truth about the nature of God than was had among all the churches and professions of belief in the entire world. The boy prophet, Joseph, now knew that God the Father and Jesus Christ were separate personages. Each had a body of flesh and bones. They could indeed reveal themselves to their chosen prophets just as they did to the prophets in ancient times. Living testimony, personal revelation, is the foundation stone of true religion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p18\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith sealed his testimony with his own blood. The Prophet\u2019s martyrdom was a voluntary acceptance of death to seal the testimony of the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20222\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20222)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20222)\">D&amp;C 135:1<\/a><\/span>) and to bear holy witness of Jesus Christ and his gospel in this dispensation. We do not give our testimony and life in the manner that Joseph Smith, the martyred Prophet, gave his life. Rather, we give testimony by devoted service in our lives each day to lift and strengthen others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p19\" class=\"\">The prophets who followed Joseph Smith in this dispensation each obtained their own testimonies by the same basic principles with individual application. If we consider their lives carefully, we can discover the process by which testimony comes. For example, President Brigham Young received a testimony of the truth of the Book of Mormon after two years of studious consideration. President John Taylor required only three weeks to discover that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ embodied the true religion that existed anciently as recorded in the Bible and now again restored to the earth. President Wilford Woodruff searched diligently for six years before finding the truth. He finally found it in the teachings and testimony of two Mormon missionaries. President Lorenzo Snow was the fifth President of the Church. When he met the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1831, he wrote, \u201cA light arose in my understanding which has never been extinguished\u201d (Daniel H. Ludlow, ed., <span class=\"emphasis\">Encyclopedia of Mormonism,<\/span> 4 vols., New York: Macmillan, 1992, 3:1367).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p20\" class=\"\">President David O. McKay was the ninth President of the Church. In his boyhood he desired to know, as Joseph Smith had known, of the reality of God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. One day while herding cattle in the foothills near his home, he sought a testimony through prayer. He said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cI dismounted, threw my reins over my horse\u2019s head, and there under a serviceberry bush I prayed that God would declare to me the truth of his revelation to Joseph Smith\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">New Era,<\/span> Jan. 1972, p. 56).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p22\" class=\"\">He prayed fervently and sincerely with as much faith as he could find within him. When he finished his prayer, he waited for an answer. Nothing seemed to happen. Disappointed, he rode slowly on, saying to himself at the time, \u201cNo spiritual manifestation has come to me. If I am true to myself, I must say I am just the same \u2018old boy\u2019 that I was before I prayed\u201d (ibid.).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p23\" class=\"\">A direct answer to this prayer was many years in coming. While serving a mission in Scotland, Elder McKay received a powerful spiritual manifestation. He later commented, \u201cNever before had I experienced such an emotion. \u2026 It was a manifestation for which as a doubting youth I had secretly prayed most earnestly on hillside and in meadow. It was an assurance to me that sincere prayer is answered \u2018sometime, somewhere.\u2019\u201d (Francis M. Gibbons, <span class=\"emphasis\">David O. McKay,<\/span> Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1986, p. 50).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p24\" class=\"\">Each of the prophets has testified of the personal revelation by which they have come to know the truthfulness of the gospel and of the spiritual strength of such revelation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p25\" class=\"\">People often ask me, \u201cHow do you know?\u201c \u201cHow can you know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ?\u201d While there seems to be no exact formula by which each of us receives a testimony, there does seem to be a discernable pattern. Though prayer is important in gaining a testimony, we cannot merely ask in prayer for a testimony and expect it to be given immediately to us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p26\" class=\"\">Generally, testimony emerges over time and through life\u2019s experiences. We can compare testimony to the process of watching a photograph develop. Powerful impressions of the Spirit come like flashes of light on receptive photographic film. Like the chemicals needed to develop the picture, certain spiritual conditions and experiences are needed in our lives for our personal testimony to develop into a certain truth and knowledge. And like a photograph, a testimony, if not carefully preserved, will fade with time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p27\" class=\"\">Testimonies often come when there is willingness to serve where we are called. They come when a decision is made to strive to be obedient. Testimonies come during efforts to help, lift, and strengthen others. They come from prayer and from studying the scriptures and applying them in our lives. Whatever our circumstances, there seem to be moments in each of our lives when we can be given the knowledge that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. There is no greater search in life that we can embark upon than the quest to gain a testimony of the truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p28\" class=\"\">While each of our lives is different, I believe we can, with some confidence, outline from the testimony of others, such as the prophets, and our own personal experience the process and phases we go through to gain a testimony:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p29\" class=\"\">Have a sincere desire to know the truth and express that desire in humble prayer to our Heavenly Father. \u201cIf ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10089\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10089)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10089)\">Alma 32:27<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p30\" class=\"\">Search the scriptures.

Think about them. Test them with further prayer. Relate them to what you know and feel. All the truths you will learn can eventually fit together into a fervent, undoubting testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p32\" class=\"\">Be humble and receptive. Have ears to hear when Heavenly Father leads us to someone who can teach us about the gospel of Jesus Christ. This may be a teacher, family member, neighbor, friend, or acquaintance. It might be a missionary who contacts us through tracting or referral. But know that once we pray, study, and have faith with a desire to learn spiritual matters, the Lord will provide a way for us to gain further light and knowledge.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p33\" class=\"\">Live our testimony. We must obediently follow the Savior\u2019s teachings and the prophets\u2019 examples.

Do not think that it is easy to maintain a testimony. Others will test you. Sometimes they will point the finger of mockery and scorn. Sometimes they may persecute you openly. Be prepared. Know in advance that the best of God\u2019s children have had the courage of true conviction and were willing to suffer ridicule, deprivation, and even death for the sake of true testimony. Is each of us willing to do likewise?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p36\" class=\"\">In our day, those blessed with a testimony of the truth have a shield of faith that will protect them from the fiery darts of the adversary at the hands of critics and detractors.

These doubts can be resolved, if they have an honest desire to know the truth, by exercising moral, spiritual, and mental effort. They will emerge from the conflict into a firmer, stronger, larger faith because of the struggle. They have gone from a simple, trusting faith, through doubt and conflict, into a solid substantial faith which ripens into testimony\u201d (in Conference Report, Oct. 1960, p. 108).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/the-importance-of-receiving-a-personal-testimony.p40\" class=\"\">The fruits of testimony may be observed in the lives of the faithful.
