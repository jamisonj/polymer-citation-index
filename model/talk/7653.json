My father, whose Saturdays were always filled with chores for his grandsons, stopped by our home with an offer to \u201cgo for a ride.\u201d Always happy to ride in Grandpa\u2019s truck, our four- and six-year-old sons scurried into the back jump seat, and I joined my father in the front. Our drive took us through the streets of downtown Logan, which wrap around the Logan Temple, prominently situated on a hill, centered beautifully in the city. As we moved further away from the city, we turned from paved, busy streets to seldom-used dirt roads, where we crossed old bridges and weaved through trees far into the country. We were far from any other traffic and all alone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p7\" class=\"\">Realizing his grandsons were in a place they had not been before, my father stopped the truck. \u201cDo you think we are lost?\u201d he asked the wide-eyed boys as they gazed out the windshield across the valley. Followed by a moment of silent assessment came the profound reply of a young child. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, pointing his finger. \u201cGrandpa, you are never lost when you can see the temple.\u201d Our eyes turned, focusing with his, seeing the sun glistening off the spires of the Logan Temple, far across the valley.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p8\" class=\"\">You are never lost when you can see the temple.

I would like to invite each of you to do this also. Wherever your home may be and whatever its configuration, the application of eternal gospel principles within its walls is universal. Let\u2019s begin. Imagine that you are opening your front door and walking inside your home. What do you see, and how do you feel? Is it a place of love, peace, and refuge from the world, as is the temple? Is it clean and orderly? As you walk through the rooms of your home, do you see uplifting images which include appropriate pictures of the temple and the Savior? Is your bedroom or sleeping area a place for personal prayer? Is your gathering area or kitchen a place where food is prepared and enjoyed together, allowing uplifting conversation and family time? Are scriptures found in a room where the family can study, pray, and learn together? Can you find your personal gospel study space? Does the music you hear or the entertainment you see, online or otherwise, offend the Spirit? Is the conversation uplifting and without contention? That concludes our tour. Perhaps you, as I, found a few spots that need some \u201chome improvement\u201d\u2014hopefully not an \u201cextreme home makeover.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p13\" class=\"\">Whether our living space is large or small, humble or extravagant, there is a place for each of these gospel priorities in each of our homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/sacred-homes-sacred-temples.p14\" class=\"\">In order to keep the temple and those who attend it sacred and worthy, the Lord has established standards through His servants, the prophets.

Monson of the Quorum of the Twelve suggested deep spiritual meaning in the physical presence of the temple. He recounted the late Elder Matthew Cowley\u2019s story about a grandfather who took his small granddaughter on a birthday visit to the Salt Lake Temple grounds. With permission of the groundskeeper, they walked to the large doors of the temple. He suggested that she place her hand on the temple wall and then on the door, saying tenderly to her, \u2018Remember that this day you touched the temple. One day you will enter this door.\u2019 His special gift to his granddaughter was an appreciation for the House of the Lord. Likewise, counseled Elder Monson, \u2018As we touch the temple, the temple will touch us.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-04205_000_033\"><a name=\"-04205_000_033\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote7-04205_000_033\">7.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>See \u201cTemples around the World,\u201d at temples.lds.org.
