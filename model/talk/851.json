There should be three special witnesses that should bear record to the world, and\nsaid he: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few according to the will of God, to\nbear testimony of his word unto the children of men; for the Lord God hath said that the\nwords of the faithful should speak as if it were from the dead.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of the book; and in the\nmouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him good will he establish his word; and wo be unto\nhim that rejecteth the word of God!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3601\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3601)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3601)\">2 Ne. 27:13-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI shall not take time to read the testimonies of the Three Witnesses, nor of the Eight\nWitnesses to the Book of Mormon. These are published in each copy of that book.  The\ntestimony of Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris was that in the presence of\nan angel they beheld the record from which the Book of Mormon was translated, and had the\nprivilege of examining it in the presence of that heavenly being, and the voice of the Lord\nsounded to them from the heavens calling upon them to bear witness of this truth, to every\nnation, kindred, tongue, and people\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43105\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43105)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43105)\">BM Three Wit.<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nEight other witnesses beheld the plates, but not in the presence of an angel\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43117\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43117)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43117)\">BM Eight Wit.<\/a><\/span>).  These are the\nwitnesses spoken of in the Book of Mormon, whom the Lord said he would call to bear\nrecord of the truth of this Book of Mormon.\n<\/p><p>\nAll those who have heard of the Book of Mormon, all those who have read it, have had the\nopportunity to read the testimonies of Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris,\nwho bore solemn testimony to the truth of this record, that is, of its being revealed. If they\nrefuse to read (and yet their attention has been called to this fact, that the Lord has spoken,\nthat he has given into the hands of the world today the record of those people who lived\nanciently) and they turn away and reject it, they will have to answer for it before the\nJudgment seat of God.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd wo be unto those who take it upon themselves to fight these revelations.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear witness to you that the Lord has made it very clear to me by revelation which I have\nreceived, and many of you who are here present can bear witness likewise, that these things\nare true, and that is the privilege of any sincere person who will endeavor to read with a\nprayerful spirit and a desire to know whether the book is true or not; and he will receive that\ntestimony according to the promise that was made by Moroni\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38265\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38265)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38265)\">Moro. 10:4<\/a><\/span>), who sealed the record to come\nforth in the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times.\n<\/p><p>\nI thought it would be well, however, to bring two testimonies here and read them, one from\nDavid Whitmer and one from Oliver Cowdery.  When I read these, I am going to read the\ncopies that I made from the original sources.

Having resided here for half of a\ncentury, it is with no little pride that he points to his past record, with the consciousness that\nhe has done nothing derogatory to his character as a citizen and a believer in the Son of Mary\nto warrant such an attack on him, coming from what source it may, and now, with the lilies\nof seventy-five winters crowning him like an aureole, and, his pilgrimage on earth well nigh\nended he reiterates his former statement and will leave futurity to solve the problem that he\nwas, but a passing witness of its fulfillment.\"\n<\/p><p>\nFrom a letter written by Oliver Cowdery, another of the three witnesses, to his brother-in-law,\nPhineas Young, March 23, 1846, from Tiffin, Ohio, I copy this: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I have cherished a hope, and that one of my fondest, that I might leave such a character as\nthose who might believe in my testimony, after I should be called hence, might do so, not\nonly for the sake of the truth, but might not blush for the private character of the man who\nbore that testimony.  I have been sensitive on this subject, I admit, but I ought to be so, you\nwould be under the circumstances, had you stood in the presence of John with our departed\nBrother Joseph, to receive the Lesser Priesthood, and in the presence of Peter, to receive the\nGreater, and look down through time, and witness the effects these two must produce&mdash;you\nwould feel what you have never felt, were wicked men conspiring to lessen the effects of\nyour testimony on man, after you have gone to your long-sought rest.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYou know, when Oliver Cowdery wrote that he was not a member of the Church, he had left\nthe Church through some transgression. Not long, however, after he wrote this letter to his\nbrother-in-law he found his way back to the body of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Prophet Joseph Smith was in Carthage Jail with his brother Hyrum, John Taylor,\nand Willard Richards, the Prophet asked that a letter be written to Oliver Cowdery asking him\nif he had not fed upon the husks long enough\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31441\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31441)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31441)\">Luke 15:16<\/a><\/span>).\nI do not know what became of that letter, but\nevidently it must have been written and shortly after the martyrdom, Oliver Cowdery found\nhis way back to Nauvoo and then continued his journey across the Territory of Iowa to the\ncamp of the Latter-day Saints at Kanesville, where he made his plea to be brought back again\ninto the Church, testifying there again, which testimony I think is quite generally known, that\nhe was not asking to come back for any place or position, but merely to be a humble member\nof the Church, and he bore witness to the same things on his return.\n<\/p><p>\nJust another word&mdash;if Oliver Cowdery had been lying and the story was not true, at the time\nwhen unstable members of the Church were forsaking it, he never would have gone to\nNauvoo, among the enemies of the people, and then continued his journey westward to find\nthe body of the Latter-day Saints when everyone else thought they had gone to their\ndestruction.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord bless you, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
