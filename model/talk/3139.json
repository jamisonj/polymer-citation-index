The grandparent family organization develops as children from the immediate family marry and have children. Through such family organizations, every family in the Church should become actively involved in missionary work, family preparedness, genealogy and temple work, teaching the gospel, and cultural and social activities. These vital responsibilities certainly have not changed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">Next, consider some things which have changed:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The four-generation program has changed in a very significant way. In the past each individual was responsible for the submission of his or her four-generation family group record forms. December 1978 marks the end of the old (current) four-generation program. Beginning July 1979, the Church will accept newly prepared pedigree charts and family group record forms from family organizations, rather than from individuals. In the interim between now and July 1979, members of the Church are encouraged to organize as families\u2014each individual with his brothers, sisters, and parents\u2014to compare the information on the family group sheets which they have in common, check the accuracy of the information, verify the dates, and formulate <span class=\"emphasis\">one<\/span> record to be submitted on behalf of <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> family members appearing on the group sheet. This process repeats itself next with the parents (if still living), and so on until all generations are completed, verified, and corrected as necessary. You can readily see the importance of the family organization.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A second major change is that original research beyond the four-generation level will be accepted but will no longer be required of individual members or individual families in the Church. Instead, the Church has assumed the responsibility to begin a massive record-gathering and extraction program in order to prepare names for temple work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p18\" class=\"\">Those who are acquainted with Latter-day Saint scriptures and the process of genealogical research will recognize that the extraction program is but a first step in the overall program of preparing a Church book of remembrance \u201cworthy of \u2026 acceptation.\u201d The extraction program is primarily aimed at more efficient identification and processing of names for individual temple ordinance work. It solves the immediate need to provide many more names for the operation of the temples.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p19\" class=\"\">In the past it was not uncommon for family organizations to spend an inordinate amount of time, money, and effort in search of a given ancestor. Now it would seem that once a reasonable, conventional effort has been made to locate a given ancestor, if he or she cannot be found, the family organization can assume its responsibility completed and move on to the next line or ancestor in question, leaving the processing of the unidentifiable ancestor to the extraction\/indexing program.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p20\" class=\"\">Now may I say a word about ancestral-type family organizations. Ancestral family organizations are comprised of descendants of a common ancestral couple. The major purpose for organizing or perpetuating an ancestral family organization is to coordinate genealogical activity on common ancestral lines. When ancestral family organizations deviate from this major objective and seek primarily to provide social, cultural, or other types of activities, they take over the legitimate domain of the immediate and grandparent organizations. With the change announced by President Kimball, a gradual but definite transition should occur so that the genealogical work in progress is completed. The immediate and grandparent family organizations should then be assigned the responsibility of reunions and soliciting of funds.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p21\" class=\"\">Another legitimate function of the ancestral organization is to provide resource material from which the immediate and grandparent family organizations can draw to complete family histories\u2014especially on their first four generations. Thus the ancestral organizations may accumulate, properly file, catalog, and preserve histories, photographs, letters, manuscripts, diaries, journals, and published books.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p22\" class=\"\">Again, I emphasize that every family in the Church should belong to an immediate and, insofar as possible, a grandparent family organization. Ancestral organizations exist only for the coordination of genealogical activity, which includes family histories. Once this function has been accomplished the ancestral family organization might well be dissolved, or at least reduced in importance, in favor of the immediate and grandparent organizations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p23\" class=\"\">Once the families in the Church become organized as the prophet has counseled, and after we have done all we can as a church and as family organizations to identify our progenitors, then perhaps we may qualify for this prophetic blessing spoken of by President Brigham Young:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cYou will enter into the Temple of the Lord and begin to offer up ordinances before the Lord for your dead. \u2026 Before this work is finished, a great many of the Elders of Israel in Mount Zion will become pillars in the Temple of God, to go no more out: they will eat and drink and sleep there; and they will often have occasion to say\u2014\u2018Somebody came into the Temple last night; we did not know who he was, but he was no doubt a brother, and told us a great many things we did not before understand. <span class=\"emphasis\">He gave us the names of a great many of our forefathers that are not on record,<\/span> and he gave me my true lineage and the names of my forefathers for hundreds of years back. He said to me, \u2018You and I are connected in one family; there are the names of your ancestors; take them and write them down, and be baptised and confirmed, and save such and such ones, and receive of the blessings of the eternal Priesthood for such and such an individual, as you do for yourselves.\u2019 This is what we are going to do for the inhabitants of the earth. When I look at it, I do not want to rest a great deal, but be industrious all the day long; for when we come to think upon it, we have no time to lose, for it is a pretty laborious work.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 6:295; italics added.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p25\" class=\"\">In keeping with the principles which I have outlined to you, I have organized my family, as I\u2019m sure scores of you have done\u2014the Ezra Taft Benson Family Organization\u2014as a grandparent family.

My wife and I have tried to set the example by preparing and distributing a brief summary of our own personal histories to our posterity. Further histories have been prepared, or are in the process of preparation, on each of our ancestors on my lines and my wife\u2019s lines as they appear on our first pedigree chart for four generations back. To our children this represents five generations of family histories; to the grandchildren, six; and the great-grandchildren, seven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p28\" class=\"\">In the preparation of these histories, we have sought to write them in a common style and follow a common format. They have been typed on genealogical-size sheets so they might conveniently be included in the family book of remembrance. An effort has been made to keep them brief, with a goal that none of them would exceed ten genealogical-size pages. We have taken pains to have them reproduced by offset press so that the quality of the print would encourage use and reading. It is also our intent to add pictures of each ancestor to his or her history. We have encouraged members of our family organization to use these histories as a basis for family home evenings, held in their immediate families, to teach their children appreciation, love, and respect for their ancestors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p29\" class=\"\">Now, if you have not already done so, may I encourage you to organize your immediate and grandparent families and prepare your individual and family histories.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cLet us go to and attend to our ordinances, then when we go to the spirit world and meet with father, mother, brother or sister they cannot rise up and accuse us of negligence. \u2026 These [temple] ordinances have been revealed to us; we understand them, and unless we attend to them we shall fall under condemnation.\u201d (Wilford Woodruff, in <span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 13:327.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/worthy-of-all-acceptation.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cShall we not,\u201d as the Prophet Joseph Smith declared, \u201cgo on in so great a cause?
