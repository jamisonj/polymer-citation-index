But if you wish to destroy us for doing the works of Abraham and of Christ, know ye that God will curse you; and neither He nor His people will allow you to have any part in the covenant of promise; and neither in Abraham, nor yet in Christ can ye be blessed. There is something more implied in this change often alluded to by all professing Christians than is usually considered. It is, nevertheless, scripturally and philosophically true. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v4n1848\"> During the late session of the Legislature, a very polite note was received by that body from Mr. Van Emman, agent of the American Bible Society, who wished to have the members call at his depository and examine his Bibles, quality, and prices, and to advertise them in the various localities to which they were about to repair, and also to lay before them the object of the society in sending the Bibles to Utah. The Legislature thought proper to appoint a committee to wait upon Mr. V., examine his books, &amp;c., and being a member of the House, I, with brother F. D. Richards, was appointed said committee. In the discharge of our duties, I remarked to Mr. Van Emman, who, by the by, received us very gentlemanly, that the society which he had the honor to represent, no doubt considered us degraded and almost beyond the reach of Bible truth. He replied, that they did not consider us so degraded as we might think they did; but that it was the design of the society to put the word of God into the hands of every man in the world, Utah not excepted. I replied, that this was very good. But however charitable and benevolent the designs of that society may <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"261b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD04\/JoD04_0261.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;261b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/0498\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> be, so far as Utah is concerned, they have sent us the wrong book if they wish to reclaim us from the belief in and practice of Polygamy: for instead of its reclaiming us, it confirms us in our belief and practice, and nowhere condemns it; and, hence, we are conscientious in our manner of life, having the word of God which you bring us for our standard. Although our faith and practice are such as we declare unto you, yet no people on earth look with greater abhorrence and indignation upon a violation of the principles that govern us than we do. No man or woman among us, not of our faith, that behaves himself, and violates not our laws and regulations, has any occasion to fear molestation. But if he or she violates them and will not desist, I cannot vouch for his safety, member of our Church or not, neither can I insure his house to stand. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v4n1849\"> We have had, and still have among us, men who write back to the States glaring accounts of our character and conduct, and bitter complaints of our treatment toward them; but it would be hard for them to detail the awful treatment they pretend to represent. We do not often act without a cause; and one, too, which, with them, we are willing to meet at the bar of God and answer to our treatment. We have been unmercifully forced to come to Utah; but we force no one else to come; yet if they do come, we want them to behave themselves, and attend to their own business. We do not consider an officer of the government to have any more right to commit wickedness than anyone else; and if he does, he merits as severe a rebuke, and even more so, for he not only destroys his influence and power to do good, but brings dishonor upon the power that sent him. I would say to our friends, that I have no hesitancy in recommending the Bibles of Mr. Van Emman.

Everybody says they are, I say we are, and for the rest, our works may speak. One circumstance, however, I will mention. Some letter writer, probably of the <span class=\"italic\">corps militaire<\/span>, thought it deeply degrading that the wife of Orson Hyde, chief of the Apostles, should take in washing for a living: but if she had kept some house other than a laundry, not necessary to say what kind, it might have elevated her in the gentleman's estimation, to the ranks of fashionable life. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v4n1852\"> If this gentleman had ever ascended the Nile, he would have learned that the native men who tow and propel boats up that stream in which travelers are conveyed, are mostly in a state of perfect nudity. This they do on account of the exceeding warm weather, and also for convenience sake, being as often in the water as out of it. They do not wish to be encumbered with clothing. European gentlemen, traveling with their families up the Nile, often purchase them entire suits, not out of any particular regard they have for the natives, but out of special regard for the modesty and delicacy of their families. So also some of our good and industrious wives, who are not above doing whatever is necessary to be done in their sphere, often condescend (however humiliating the service) to wash up a stranger's linen, that he may appear in &#x201C;Mormon society&#x201D; without being particularly obnoxious. Industry is our element. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v4n1853\"> Is persevering industry a faithful index to all the crime, debauchery, and wickedness with which we are charged?

Can such a mass of corrupt beings as we are represented, hang together, be united and submit to rigid rule and discipline so long&#x2014;encounter every hardship and privation that we have, and still be cheerful and buoyant with hope? There may be some little family irregularities occasionally, but they are soon adjusted. Are there no family disturbances among other people? I have often read of the husband murdering the wife, and the wife the husband, among those who consider it a high crime to have more than one wife. This is a thing of frequent occurrence. But who ever knew of a &#x201C;Mormon&#x201D; intentionally killing any of his wives, or any wife her husband? No one! I answer again, no one! <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v4n1854\"> All things, now, candidly and impartially considered, to what conclusion must the unprejudiced and candid arrive respecting the &#x201C;Mormons?&#x201D; It seems to me that they must conclude something as follows: <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v4n1855\"> There may be those among them, both male and female, who do not behave as they ought, for their net catches of every kind, both good and bad.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"64682\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 64682)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(64682)\">Matt. 13:47-48<\/a><\/span> The crucible or refining pot is Utah.
