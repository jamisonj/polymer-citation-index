This conference is being broadcast to 68 countries and translated into 55 languages. This is truly a global Church, with members spread across the nations of the earth. We are all children of a living and loving God, our Heavenly Father.

Hinckley in the dedication of the rebuilt Nauvoo Temple. It brought us back to the Prophet Joseph and renewed our memories of the early Saints; their sacrifices, sorrows, and tears; but also their courage, faith, and trust in the Lord. I have no ancestors among the 19th-century pioneers. However, since the first days of my Church membership, I have felt a close kinship to those early pioneers who crossed the plains. They are my spiritual ancestry, as they are for each and every member of the Church, regardless of nationality, language, or culture. They have established not only a safe place in the West but also a spiritual foundation for the building of the kingdom of God in all the nations of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-global-church-blessed-by-the-voice-of-the-prophets.p6\" class=\"\">As the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is now being embraced around the world, we are all pioneers in our own sphere and circumstance. It was in the turmoil of post\u2013World War II Germany when my family first learned about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. George Albert Smith was the President then. I was only a young child, and we had lost all material belongings twice within only seven years. We were refugees with an uncertain future. However, during those same seven years, we gained more than any amount of money could ever buy. We found a supernal refuge, a place of defense from despair\u2014the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and His Church, led by a true and living prophet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-global-church-blessed-by-the-voice-of-the-prophets.p7\" class=\"\">During this time of my childhood I played in bombed-out houses and grew up with the ever-present consequences of a lost war and the awareness that my own country had inflicted terrible pain on many nations during the horrific World War II.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-global-church-blessed-by-the-voice-of-the-prophets.p8\" class=\"\">The good news that Jesus Christ has made the perfect Atonement for mankind, redeeming all from the grave and rewarding each individual according to his or her works, was the healing power which brought hope and peace back into my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-global-church-blessed-by-the-voice-of-the-prophets.p9\" class=\"\">Whatever our challenges in life may be, our burdens may become light if we not only believe in Christ, but also in His ability and His power to cleanse and console our lives, and accept His peace.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-global-church-blessed-by-the-voice-of-the-prophets.p10\" class=\"\">President David O. McKay was the prophet during my teenage years. I seemed to know him personally: I could feel his love, kindness, and dignity; he gave me confidence and courage in my young life. Even though I grew up thousands of miles away in Europe, I felt he trusted me, and I did not want to disappoint him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/the-global-church-blessed-by-the-voice-of-the-prophets.p11\" class=\"\">Another source of strength was a letter written by the Apostle Paul while he was in prison, addressed to Timothy, his most trusted assistant and friend.

E. McCulloch, <span class=\"emphasis\">Home: The Savior of Civilization<\/span> [1924], 42; in Conference Report, Apr. 1964, 5). In 1995 the prophets of our day called upon all the world to strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society. And only three years ago the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles lovingly stated: \u201cWe counsel parents and children to give highest priority to family prayer, family home evening, gospel study and instruction, and wholesome family activities.
