Hopefully this will be done in a relaxed, almost conversational way by citing a few remembrances, a few of life\u2019s little lessons\u2014nothing spectacular. There will also be several one-liners whose durability reflects their brevity. The focus of these remembrances is upon being stretched by a merciful Lord (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43513\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43513)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43513)\">Moro. 10:3<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p6\" class=\"\">If just one of these remembrances can be \u201clikened\u201d unto yourselves (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43388\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43388)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43388)\">1 Ne. 19:23<\/a><\/span>), there might be a brief father and son discussion later on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p7\" class=\"\">1. Let\u2019s go back 60 years. The minutes of the Wandamere Ward of the Grant Stake for June 4, 1944, indicate the sacrament was administered by my friends Ward Jackson, Arthur Hicks, and me to a congregation of 141. Then it was off to war. In May of 1945, I was blessing the sacrament again\u2014but in a foxhole on Okinawa for a congregation of only one, myself!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p8\" class=\"\">The training of my youth took over without fanfare\u2014something only partially appreciated by me then\u2014including abstaining from coffee in those same circumstances when water was scarce and highly chlorinated.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p9\" class=\"\">I do not know what lies ahead of you young men, but my advice would be to fasten your seat belts and hold on firmly to your principles!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p10\" class=\"\">2.

Back then, in family, neighborhood, ward, and school life, we were all poor together, but we didn\u2019t know it. We made room for each other to grow, to make dumb mistakes, to repent, and to begin to develop at least some spiritual reflexes. Today, some anxious parents seem to insist on constantly pulling up the daisies to see how the roots are doing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p12\" class=\"\">4. Young or old, my priesthood brothers, be grateful for people in your lives who love you enough to correct you, to remind you of your standards and possibilities, even when you don\u2019t want to be reminded.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p13\" class=\"\">A dear and now deceased friend said to me years ago when I had said something sardonic, \u201cYou could have gone all day without saying that.\u201d His one-liner reproof was lovingly stated, illustrating how correction can be an act of affection.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p14\" class=\"\">5. When loved ones exemplify, it is especially memorable. My sister Lois, legally blind from birth, not only coped but served well as a public schoolteacher for 33 years. She had that same reflex possessed by those pioneer souls who quietly picked up their handcarts and headed west, a reflex we all need. So if various trials are allotted to you, partake of life\u2019s bitter cups, but without becoming bitter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p15\" class=\"\">6. Soon after arriving home from World War II, I had \u201cpromises to keep\u201d (Robert Frost, \u201cStopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,\u201d in <span class=\"emphasis\">The Poetry of Robert Frost,<\/span> ed. Edward Connery Lathem [1969], 225)\u2014meaning going on a mission <span class=\"emphasis\">now.<\/span> I grew tired of waiting for the bishop. And in some early ark-steadying, I went to the bishop\u2019s home and said I had saved the money and wanted to go, so let\u2019s \u201cget this show on the road.\u201d The good bishop hesitated, and then said he\u2019d been meaning to ask me about going.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p16\" class=\"\">Years later, I would learn from that bishop\u2019s devoted ward clerk that the bishop had felt I needed a little more time with my family after having been away so far and for a tenth of my life. Hearing this, I chastised myself for having been too judgmental. (See Bruce C. Hafen, <span class=\"emphasis\">A Disciple\u2019s Life: The Biography of Neal A. Maxwell<\/span> [2002], 129\u201330.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p17\" class=\"\">No wonder the wise father of Elder Henry B.

Two relevant memories for young fathers. When I was such, I had just received a phone call telling me of a friend\u2019s death in an accident. I was sitting in the living room with tears streaking down my cheeks. Our young son, Cory, saw the tears as he passed in the hallway. I learned that he had anxiously assumed the tears were because he had disappointed me in some way. He didn\u2019t know about the phone call. Brethren, we underestimate how genuinely and frequently our children want to please us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p19\" class=\"\">8. Having virtually no quantitative skills, I was seldom if ever able to help our children with math and scientific subjects. One day our high school daughter Nancy asked me for \u201ca little help\u201d regarding a Supreme Court case, <span class=\"emphasis\">Fletcher v. Peck.<\/span> I was so eager to help after so many times of not being able to help. At last a chance to unload! Out came what I knew about <span class=\"emphasis\">Fletcher v.

In later years, I saw a few leave the Church who could then never leave it alone. They used often their intellectual reservations to cover their behavioral lapses (see Neal A. Maxwell, <span class=\"emphasis\">All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience<\/span> [1979], 110). You will see some of that. By the way, do not expect the world\u2019s solutions to the world\u2019s problems to be very effective. Such solutions often resemble what C. S. Lewis wrote about those who go dashing back and forth with fire extinguishers in times of flood (see <span class=\"emphasis\">The Screwtape Letters <\/span>[1959], 117\u201318). Only the gospel is constantly relevant, and the substitute things won\u2019t work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p22\" class=\"\">10. Once when traveling with Elder and Sister Russell M. Nelson, we left our hotel in Bombay, India, to catch a plane for Karachi, Pakistan, and then on to Islamabad. When we got to the chaotic airport, our flight had been canceled. Impatiently, I said to the man at the airline counter, \u201cWhat do you expect us to do, just give up and go back to the hotel?\u201d He said with great dignity, \u201cSir, you never go back to the hotel.\u201d We rummaged about the airport, found a flight, kept the appointment in Islamabad, and even had a night\u2019s sleep. Sometimes life is like that: we are left to press forward and endure frustrated expectations\u2014refusing to \u201cgo back to the hotel\u201d! Otherwise, such \u201cgive-up-itis\u201d will affect all seasons of life. Besides, the Lord knows how many miles we have to go \u201cbefore [we] sleep\u201d!

In 1956, after returning home from several years in Washington, D.C., and having declined several attractive offers there, I received an offer to work at the University of Utah. My wife said I should take it. She said presciently, \u201cI feel if you go there, maybe you will have some influence on students.\u201d I replied impatiently, \u201cI\u2019ll be typing news releases, not working with students.\u201d The subsequent opportunities included being a bishop of a student ward, dean of students, and teaching hundreds of fine students in political science. It wasn\u2019t status that mattered, of course, but being stretched and being given opportunities to serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p24\" class=\"\">Our wives are often inspired but sometimes in counterintuitive ways\u2014a reality, young men, which your fathers may be brave enough to explain to you sometime.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p25\" class=\"\">12. It\u2019s interesting, too, how we create, cumulatively, expectations in the lives of our grandchildren even when we are not aware of it. Some years ago, when our grandson Robbie was about five, we dropped by to see his family in Orem. He was asleep upstairs, and his mother called, \u201cRobbie, Grandpa Neal is here!\u201d A tired little voice floated downstairs saying, \u201cShall I bring my scriptures?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p26\" class=\"\">Of course, he was too young to read them, but he carried them, as so many do in the Church today in that fine new pattern!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/remember-how-merciful-the-lord-hath-been.p27\" class=\"\">Brethren, there are clusters of memories embedded in each of your lives.
