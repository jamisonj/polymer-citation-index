I rejoice with you on this Easter Sunday in the opportunity we all\nhave to pay homage to our Savior and to give to him our thanksgiving and veneration for the\nincomparable gift of eternal life which he brought to all mankind.  We remind ourselves on\nthis day that we are charged with the transcendent responsibility of building and maintaining\nhis kingdom in the earth.  It is in the hope that I may add a word of contribution to that\ngreatest of all causes that I bring to you a somewhat practical suggestion on this sacred day. \nTermites are permeating the foundation of the kingdom&mdash;the homes of the people&mdash;even\nmore destructive and elusive than those semi-microscopic little animals that\nbreak down our walls.  Corrective measures are imperative.\n<\/p><p>\nI have chosen to make some comment on a theme which I earnestly hope may not prove to be\ntoo provocative, and certainly not offensive, to our sisters and to other women who may\nlisten.  I lift my text, with full acknowledgment, from an article appearing in <i>This Week Magazine<\/i>\nof some months ago, and recently reprinted in the <i>Reader's Digest<\/i>, written by\nJudge Samuel S. Leibowitz, senior judge of Brooklyn's highest criminal court. The article is\nentitled: \"Nine Words That Can Stop Juvenile Delinquency,\" and the nine words used by the\nJudge are these: \"Put Father Back at the Head of the Family.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt is likely that many of our audience have read this challenging article, and there is no time\nat my disposal to do more than to set before you a few statistical items and a few conclusions\ndrawn by this eminent judge who has spent 21 years of his life as a criminal lawyer and 16\nyears as a judge in the criminal court, with long years of study and observation on causes of\nteenage crime.  He went to Europe and discovered from official reports that the percentage of\ncrimes committed in each of the following countries by offenders 18 years of age or under\nwas as follows: \n<\/p><p>\nIn Italy: 2 percent of sex crimes, and 1\/2 of 1 percent of homicides.<br \/>\nIn France: 7 percent of sex crimes, with 8 percent of homicides.<br \/>\nIn Belgium: 12 percent of sex crimes, with 1 percent of homicides.<br \/>\nIn Germany: 15 percent of sex crimes, with 2 percent of homicides.<br \/>\nIn Britain: 16 percent of sex crimes, and 1 percent of homicides.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd&mdash;here is the tragedy&mdash;in the United States 35 percent of all sex crimes are committed\nby offenders under 18, and 12 percent of all murders are committed by offenders under 18.\nTeenage offenders in the United States exceeded those of other countries reported, ranging\nfrom 1800 percent to 100 percent.  The judge reached the conclusion that there must be some\nprincipal factor in this great disparity so unfavorable to our own country, and he discovered,\nas perhaps might well have been assumed, that the primary reason for the reduced percentages\nof juvenile delinquency in the European countries was respect for authority, and that the\nprincipal contribution to that respect, which might not have been so readily assumed, was\nrespect for authority in the home, which, as he points out, normally reposes in the father as\nhead of the family.\n<\/p><p>\nThese conclusions reached by this judicial investigator I believe would seem more sensational\nand surprising to people outside of the Church to which we have the honor to belong than to\nour own members.  For generations we as a Church have been endeavoring to do just what\nthe judge advocates&mdash;to put and keep Father at the head of the family, and with all our\nmight we have been trying to make him fit for that high and heavy responsibility.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I take a few minutes to give you our concept of home, fatherhood, and motherhood?\nNothing occupies a more unique and distinctive and important position in our theology and\nunderstanding of God's purposes for his children.\n<\/p><p>\nWe define a home as being a divinely appointed institution established on the enduring\ncompact of a good man and a good woman, wherein spiritual children of our Eternal Father\nare permitted to receive mortal bodies endowed with eternal intelligence, these children so\nreceived in the home to be nurtured in health and so guided in the ways of living by loving\nand wise parents that they may be conditioned on completion of their lives to return to the\npresence of the Lord whence their spirits originally came. In this greatest of all enterprises the\nman and the woman are partners&mdash;co-signers, if you will, of the enduring compact which\nbinds them together.\n<\/p><p>\nIn this eternal compact, however, there is a feature which may not be understood by many\nthousands of men and women who enter into Christian marriage.  It is the element of\npriesthood.  Two things have been revealed about priesthood and marriage which are of most\nvital importance. First, that no marriage which is to endure forever, so that\nin essence a home may be projected into eternity, may be established without the\nauthorization and sanction of divinely appointed priesthood.  And secondly, that no marriage\nis eligible for the solemnization of divinely appointed priesthood without the man party to the\ncompact having first received the endowment of the Holy Priesthood himself.\n<\/p><p>\nWe call the ordinance of marriage when performed not only for time but for all eternity a\nsealing&mdash;a sealing of a good woman to a good man of the priesthood, with the express\nunderstanding and covenant that the priesthood of the man, if he shall be faithful and live\nworthy to enjoy it, shall be the supreme authority of the household, and no good woman of\nour faith begrudges her worthy husband of the priesthood the respect which goes with his\nhigh calling. She knows that to build him up in the esteem of their children, and thus make\nhim conscious of the responsibility of leadership is the surest safeguard she can bring to her\nfamily in a world of temptation. The women of the Church rejoice in the priesthood of their\nhusbands. They know that that priesthood is not expressed in autocratic or unrighteous\ndominion.  They know that it is a divinely given power to be exercised only in long-suffering\nand patience, kindness and mercy, \"reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by\nthe Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him\" who hast\nbeen reproved (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13686\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13686)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13686)\">D&amp;C 121:43<\/a><\/span>).\nThey know that that priesthood has true virtue within \nit&mdash;the power to bless, the power to heal, the power to counsel, to make peace and harmony\nprevail.\n<\/p><p>\nPerhaps the saddest of all our women are they who see their husbands fall away from that\npriesthood with which they have been endowed. They are the wives who are filled with\nanxiety for the future of themselves and their, families.  In the true companionship of a\nhusband of the priesthood a good woman may pass through any trouble and have comfort,\nresignation, and peace.  But if her husband fails her and fails his holy calling, it is hard\nindeed for consolation to come to her. She grieves, she prays, she pleads&mdash;sometimes\nseemingly in vain.\n<\/p><p>\nYou husbands of the priesthood who have been neglectful of your covenants, I plead with\nyou, in behalf of sorrowing wives and families, to relieve the pain you are causing those who\nlove you, to regain manhood and strength and be worthy to assume in righteousness the\nleadership of your families. They want to respect you.  They will if you will let them.\n<\/p><p>\nI think I have spoken for the great majority of our wives and mothers. There may be,\nhowever, a few who are not helping as much as they may do in the maintenance and\nre-establishment of respect for proper authority and leadership in the home. We have many\nbrilliant women.  I have admiration for  their  superior  accomplishments. They are\ncontinually becoming more influential in all aspects of life and living, and I have no doubt\nbut that their contributions will be of lasting value.  If any of these brilliant women is a\nmother, I give it as my firm belief that however potent she may be in matters extraneous to\nthe home, she has no higher, loftier, and more divinely given calling and obligation than to be\nthe right kind of wife and mother in her home.  And however superior her attainments may\nbe, she owes a duty to her husband, to respect him as head of the family and adequately teach\nher children to do likewise.\n<\/p><p>\nThe judge to whom I referred says: \"If  mothers would understand that much of their\nimportance lies in building up the father image for the child, they would achieve the deep\nsatisfaction of children who turn out well . . . And no mother would ever have to stand before\nme with tears in her eyes and ask, 'What did I do that was wrong, Judge?  What did I do that\nwas wrong?'\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems indelicate in an address of this character even to use the expression, \"nagging wives.\" \nIf I did not regard the matter pertinent to the subject I am discussing, I would not mention it.\nI feel that women who may be said to be in this category cannot be fully conscious, whatever\ntheir provocation may be, of the damage they do to the morale of a home.  I\ngive to women generally the credit for being long-suffering and patient, and I think that in the\nforeseeable future they will still be called upon for great toleration, but I hope they will still\nbe able to show kindness and patience to those who may annoy them. I think that parental\ndisputes before the children are one of the most regrettable and lamentable of all aspects of\ndomestic relations. They are responsible for more disruption of domestic tranquility and\ninimical effects on children than almost any other occurrences in family life.  I suppose\ninevitably parents will have some differences.  For the sake of everybody concerned let them\nbe settled privately, and of course they can be settled privately if a spirit of tolerance and a\nrecognition of responsibility prevail.  I think that \"nagging wives\" cannot nag their husbands\ninto doing anything that is worth while.  Nagging is futile in the main, and disruptive of any\nspirit of harmony and peace.  In homes where the priesthood presides rebellion and devotion\nwill not thrive together.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my brethren and sisters and friends, this idea of putting Father back at the head of the\nfamily is not just a novel and catchy phrase.  It conforms to the revelations of the Lord, as I\nthink the judge who advocated it must have well known.  In Ephesians, chapter 5, verses 22\nthrough 25, we read: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.<br \/>\n\"For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is\nthe saviour of the body.<br \/>\n\"Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in\nevery thing.\n\"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21706\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21706)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21706)\">Eph. 5:22-25<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nScripture given in modern times also lends support to this fundamental doctrine.  When\nproperly interpreted and applied I do not see how good women should take exception to it.\nNo woman can be a good mother without desiring the goodness and well-being of her\nchildren. If the establishment of headship in the family contributes to their welfare, as the\nlearning on the subject seems to indicate, how can she do other than strive to establish respect\nand regard for her husband?  I admit that some husbands and fathers have made it difficult\nfor respect to be maintained for them, but to abandon the principle and thus remove from\nfathers the responsibility of maintaining virtue and goodness among their children would\ncertainly avail nothing.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is needless to say that if a father is to be respected as the head of the household he must be\nan exemplar. The article to which I have referred sets forth the principle that students of\njuvenile delinquency seem agreed upon the fact that the child, to be safe for society and his\nhome, must have dependable standards to live by.  There must be clear recognition between\nright and wrong, and there must be sound, wise, and kindly discipline.  In the midst of the\nsomewhat confusing theories advanced by the sociologists and criminologists, it seems to me\nwe cannot be going far afield by endeavoring to furnish to youth criteria for the guidance of\ntheir lives.  There are no criteria which seem dependable excepting only those which have\nbeen tried and not found wanting, principles of righteousness and truth, coming to us from\ndivine sources.  I cannot see how any intelligent parent can feel much in the way of hazard\nand uncertainty in having his child brought up to recognize the traditionally divinely approved\nvirtues and principles of conduct.\n<\/p><p>\nYesterday we read of a youth of rather high social standing gratifying a passion to kill, which\nresulted in the murder of a girl.  Tomorrow we will read of another such case, or the next\nday, or shortly thereafter.  Certainly there is something lacking in the training for life of such\nperverts.  I noted with satisfaction the observations of J. Edgar Hoover in the paper night\nbefore last on that same subject.\n<\/p><p>\nThe other day Billy Graham wrote an article for the same magazine from which I have\nquoted, under the caption, \"Why I Believe in the Devil.\" He gave three reasons.  First,\nbecause the Bible plainly says he exists.  Second, \"because I see his work everywhere.\"\nThird, because great scholars have recognized his existence.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first reason is enough for me. The Lord has revealed the existence of Satan and his place\nand function in the eternal plan of life and salvation. Billy Graham apparently did not know\nwhat modern scripture contained in the Book of Mormon and our Doctrine and Covenants\nreveals on this subject, or he would have quoted it, or at least I hope he would.  Here is a\nquotation: \n<\/p><p>\nIt must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents\nunto themselves; for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13622\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13622)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13622)\">D&amp;C 29:39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis and other illuminating scriptures indicate that man could not have had his free agency to\ndevelop strength of character, resistance to evil, and go on to perfection except he be\nsubjected to the power and the influence of Satan, the father of evil.  Some sophisticated\npeople ridicule the idea of such a personage of power, but that does not dispense with the\nrevealed account of his actuality and the record of his accomplishments.\n<\/p><p>\nSunday School teachers and others may give to the growing child teachings concerning good\nand evil, but who like the father of the family can teach the power of the Adversary and the\nresistance necessary to be built up to resist his seductive temptations to the children for whom\nhe is responsible? Who can demonstrate to the child by the power of example the virtues and\nthe standards of righteousness as can this head of the family?\n<\/p><p>\nTo all who believe that order is the law of heaven and that the kingdom of God is established\non the principles of righteousness, I submit these questions: Can order be maintained without\nacceptance of law and without discipline?  Is discipline possible without recognition of\nauthority?  In human institutions and the government of men is it not essential that authority\nbe vested in personalities?  Where is the personality more perfectly endowed by nature and\ndivine ordinance to receive and exercise authority in his own household than the father of that\nhousehold?\n<\/p><p>\nWhere can we hope for a greater contribution to come to the order of the kingdom than from\nthe homes of our land?  What greater tribute may we pay to our beloved Savior on this Easter\nday than to rededicate ourselves to the maintenance of a righteous discipline in his kingdom,\nand in all the worthy institutions which have been set up in the societies of men?  Can you\nthink of a greater kindness to youth than to prepare them in love and firmness to be worthy of\nthe love of God and the eternal blessings which he holds out to all who obey?\n<\/p><p>\nSo, my friends, I have no hesitancy, no feeling of dubiety and uncertainty in advocating the\nadoption in your homes of this salutary promising idea to bring Father back as the head of the\nfamily. I have no words to express my admiration and deep-seated regard for the mothers in\nour homes, and I am fully aware that their loving, patient care shall always be a major factor\nin the development of good and virtuous men and women.  Because of their intense love of\nhome and family I believe they will the more readily respond to the idea I am advancing. I\nknow that they will welcome anything that is right to guard against an ever-increasing\ncalamity that shakes our very national life, not only for present generations but that may\nshape its course for ages to come.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless the homes of our own land and of all the whole world. God bless the children that\nthey may come to know truth and righteousness and adopt all that is good in their lives. God\nbless the mothers for the love they bring into our homes, and God bless the fathers that they\nmay be worthy to take their appointed places as heads of the house holds over which they\nmay preside in gentleness, love, dignity, and honor, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
