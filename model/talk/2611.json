I commend to all the reading of this account. Surely we can find nothing there except some warnings and beautiful teachings which, if accepted and lived, will do more than anything else to bring peace and happiness to the world and to the individual seeking such a way of life. Here we can find explanations for many unanswered questions in the Bible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/christ-in-america.p16\" class=\"\">Third Nephi gives us additional information in more detail than the four Gospels in the New Testament, and preserves the doctrines, teachings, and compassion of the Lord. For this reason there are many who refer to Third Nephi as the \u201cfifth Gospel.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/christ-in-america.p17\" class=\"\">Our story begins with an account of the prophecies which had been given foretelling the birth of Christ. But, as has been true from the beginning, and as is true today, there were many who scoffed and said the time was past for the fulfillment of the words of the prophets. They went so far as to set apart a day when the believers should be put to death except the signs be fulfilled.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/christ-in-america.p18\" class=\"\">We are told that Nephi \u201ccried mightily unto the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5807\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5807)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5807)\">3 Ne. 1:12<\/a><\/span>), whereupon the Lord came unto him and answered him that the time was at hand for all that had been spoken by his holy prophets to be fulfilled.

Here is one of the first lessons we learn. The words of God\u2019s prophets are always fulfilled.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/christ-in-america.p19\" class=\"\">But all too soon the signs and wonders which had been experienced were forgotten, and the people waxed strong in wickedness. We read of wars and the Gadianton robbers and the desolation of the land. But those Nephites who remembered to call upon the Lord in righteousness were able to subdue their enemies, and they praised God for their deliverance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/christ-in-america.p20\" class=\"\">We are told that they \u201cdid forsake all their sins, and their abominations, and their whoredoms, and did serve God with all diligence day and night.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5809\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5809)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5809)\">3 Ne. 5:3<\/a><\/span>.)

Yes, it is indeed a true record, preserved by the hand of God to come forth in these latter days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/christ-in-america.p24\" class=\"\">Returning to our story, we find, as is so common in the world today, that as the people prospered they began to have disputations among themselves because of pride, and some did willfully rebel against God. Within only six years the majority of the people had turned to wickedness, and Nephi began to preach repentance boldly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/christ-in-america.p25\" class=\"\">This is the mission of the prophets of God: to preach repentance. And though it does not make for popularity, it must be done. We are told that the people were angry with Nephi but that he ministered with power and with great authority. We read: \u201cSo great was his faith on the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/christ-in-america.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils and unclean spirits; and even his brother did he raise from the dead, after he had been stoned and suffered death by the people.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5811\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5811)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5811)\">3 Ne. 7:18\u201319<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/christ-in-america.p27\" class=\"\">Then once again, as foretold by the prophets, the signs of Christ\u2019s crucifixion came to pass, attested by storms and earthquakes, by darkness, by thunder, and by fire. Cities sank into the depths of the sea, mountains were raised, and the whole face of the land was changed. This lasted for three days, and the people were heard to cry, saying, \u201cO that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and then would our brethren have been spared, and they would not have been burned in that great city Zarahemla.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/christ-in-america.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd in another place they were heard to cry and mourn, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then would our mothers and our fair daughters, and our children have been spared, and not have been buried up in that great city Moronihah.

Throughout ecclesiastical history we find that those who rejected the prophets and failed to repent of their wickedness were struck by calamities which caused them literally to weep and to mourn and to regret their failure to heed the warnings of the prophets. We know that Christ was crucified and some of his apostles persecuted and stoned simply for trying to establish the kingdom of God and bring people to repentance and a happier way of life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/christ-in-america.p30\" class=\"\">Today the world is rejecting the messages of the prophets of God. Is it not true that there is weeping and wailing over the face of the land because men are at war one with another? Do we not have among us many who lament the waywardness of their youth and the tragedies that befall them as they turn away from righteousness and suffer the consequences of tampering with alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, and other forbidden things? How many mourners do we have as a result of the lawlessness that is extant in our communities? We need to heed the lessons from the history of the past lest <span class=\"emphasis\">we<\/span> be consumed as were some of those earlier civilizations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/christ-in-america.p31\" class=\"\">This was the message Christ brought to those early Nephite people as his voice was heard \u201camong all the inhabitants of the earth, upon all the face of this land.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5813\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5813)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5813)\">3 Ne. 9:1<\/a><\/span>.)
