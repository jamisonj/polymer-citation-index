Evans<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the First Council of the Seventy<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Richard L. Evans, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1950, pp. 102-106<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI recall President Grant's having said many times, \"That which we persist in doing becomes\neasy.\" I have presented myself many times at this pulpit these past years, and I am not aware\nthat it has become easy&mdash;or even any easier.\n<\/p><p>\nIn all earnestness, if speaking here today to this congregation and to those outside, is to be\nless than impossibly difficult, I Shall need your help and that of my Father in heaven and I\nearnestly hope that I may have it.\n<\/p><p>\nPRIVILEGE OF REPENTANCE\n<\/p><p>\nWith Brother [Marion G.] Romney, I have been impressed that the theme of this conference\nhas been repentance. I was much impressed with the statement he read from President Smith's\nopening message of two days ago; and I remember a phrase from Dr. Merrill's talk of this\nmorning: that we shall either have repentance or slavery.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember also a reassuring sentence from President's Smith's talk of two days ago to the\neffect that every blessing may be ours on condition of repentance and of keeping the\ncommandments of God. I am very grateful for the privilege and the power of repentance, and\nI think there is evidence that we should all be lost without it.\n<\/p><p>\nI don't know what the Lord's eternal timetable is, but I am sure that he is happy to have it\nmodified by the acts of men in the use of their free agency in bringing themselves to\nrepentance. I feel sure that there is no dire prediction of any of his prophets that he would not\nbe happy to have set aside by the repentance of his people.\n<\/p><p>\nEXPERIENCE OF JONAH\n<\/p><p>\nOn this point I have heard two sermons within relatively recent times from the Book of\nJonah, both of which have impressed me: one by Dr. G. Homer Durham in which he used the\nphrase the \"Nineveh Cure.\" The \"Nineveh Cure\" of course is just plain and simple repentance.\nThe other was by Brother Marion D. Hanks, who serves us so well on Temple Square. He\nused the phrase the \"Road to Tarshish\"&mdash;which is the road of running from responsibility.\n<\/p><p>\nYou recall the experience of Jonah, that after trying to run from his responsibility he finally\ndid what the Lord asked him to do and proclaimed that destruction should come upon\nNineveh in forty days: and from the king to the lowest of his subjects there was repentance in\nthat great city, and it was not destroyed. But Jonah, being human as well as a prophet, was\nsomewhat disappointed that his prediction of destruction had not been fulfilled\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30002\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30002)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30002)\">Jonah 3:4-10<\/a><\/span>). He failed to\nunderstand, apparently, that the prediction was dependent upon obedience or disobedience,\nupon perversity or repentance, and that the Lord is happy to revise his timetable concerning\nthe affairs of men on conditions of repentance.\n<\/p><p>\nCURE FOR ILLS OF WORLD\n<\/p><p>\nAgain I am grateful for the privilege and power of repentance and am convinced that there is\nnothing wrong with this world (much as there is to worry about) that couldn't be cured by\nrepentance&mdash;and I find this hopeful fact and Brother Romney suggested it also&mdash;that\nregardless of what we may do with the opportunity, it is there. For a man to have a disease\nfor which there is no known cure is quite a different matter from having a disease for which\nthere is a known cure if he will only avail himself of it and pay the price. I am grateful that\nthere is a known cure for the ills of this world. The picture would be one of darkest despair,\nmuch darker than any yet painted, if it weren't that there is a plan and a pattern for peace in\nthe gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that there is the power and privilege\nof repentance if men will only avail themselves of it.\n<\/p><p>\nI say again, I do not know the Lord's timetable, and I think there is ample evidence that it is\nnot for us to know it; \"the day or the hour no man knoweth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34382\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34382)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34382)\">Matt. 25:13<\/a><\/span>). We read in the\nfirst chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, before the ascension of the Savior, this word to his\nApostles: \n<\/p><p>\nIt is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father has put in his own\npower (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7624\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7624)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7624)\">Acts 1:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many things that men are permitted by our Father to change in the use of their free\nagency. I recall a comment from President Boyer of the British Mission, made a day or two\nago when we met with the mission presidents, to the effect that \"so long as I have life, I shall\nfight for the privilege of having enough freedom to make a few mistakes.\" In the use of our\nfree agency we have made a few and more than a few mistakes. Some of them are costly, and\nwe shouldn't repeat them, and we should avoid making them in the first place, if possible.\nBut the contrary plan was the plan of Lucifer, the plan whereby men would not have been\npermitted to have freedom to make mistakes, and being able to repent are great privileges\nwhich our Father in heaven has given us.\n<\/p><p>\nABRAHAM'S BARGAINING\n<\/p><p>\nI do not know what degree of repentance would be required of us to avert some of the things\nthat might be imminent or at least remote possibilities. You recall Abraham's bargaining\nconcerning the destruction of Sodom, how he pleaded that the city would be spared if there\nwere fifty righteous souls, then forty-five, and so on down to ten\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23567\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23567)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23567)\">Gen. 18:23-33<\/a><\/span>). I doubt that we shall realize\nterms as favorable as Abraham was able to secure for Sodom. Apparently he was an astute\nbargainer, but the ten weren't found, and Sodom wasn't saved. I don't know that ten of a city\nwould be enough to save us today, but I am sure that the degree of our repentance will be\ntaken into consideration. And I earnestly hope and pray that we may give full repentance, and\nothers with us, to the end that our Father in heaven in his mercy and in his patience and in\nhis love for his children, which he has declared, and in whose immortality and eternal life he\nhas stated his earnest interest, will revise his timetables, whatever they may be, according to\nthe degree of our repentance. If he would agree to save a city for ten repentant souls, think\nwhat he would do for a whole nation or people who repented!\n<\/p><p>\nFAITH IN FUTURE\n<\/p><p>\nI recall some five years ago one of the world's eminent philosophers and historians&mdash;a\nBritish philosopher and historian&mdash;making some dire predictions following shortly in the\nwake of the war He said, \"It is the end,\" and then went on to elaborate that\nstatement. But it has been five years since then, and I believe that this is a Church that has\nfaith in the future. The statement of President Smith here yesterday is to me evidence of\nit&mdash;the statement that some two hundred or more places of worship have been built by this\nChurch since the philosopher said, \"It is the end.\" There must be many more than this number\nin the building or in prospect, which is another evidence of our faith in the future. It seems to\nme that our building program alone, and all our other plans for the future, are evidence of our\nfaith in the future of this Church.\n<\/p><p>\nWe must have faith in the future regardless of the ultimate eventualities. One of the greatest\ncalamities in this world would be the calamity of sitting down and waiting for calamities. We\nmust not let the things we can't do keep us from doing the things we can do. We must not let\nremote possibilities or even imminent probabilities keep us from moving forward with all\nearnestness and all effort.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to say to the young people of this generation that they too must have faith in\nthe future. In spite of all the uncertainties, they must go forward and prepare themselves as\nbest they can for all the problems and opportunities of life. Whatever may come here or\nhereafter, the future will always be better for those who are best prepared.\n<\/p><p>\nNo generation has ever lived without facing uncertainty. If those who faced the uncertainties\nof ten or twenty-five or fifty years ago had sat by and waited for what seemed to them to be\nimminent calamities, we should not have had the able and ready and well qualified men that\nwe have today, and that we need and shall need in the next generation.\n<\/p><p>\nSo I say to these youth of ours: go forth and live your lives with humility, with gratitude,\nwith repentance, keeping the commandments of God and having faith in the future and\npreparing yourselves for the future, as the Church itself continues its building. There is\nnothing to lose by having faith in the future, but there is much to lose by not preparing for\nthe future.\n<\/p><p>\nI was grateful to hear President Smith say that last year was the year of greatest growth for\nthis Church. We have so many things to be grateful for.\n<\/p><p>\nTIME OF THE END\n<\/p><p>\nI recall a reported statement, attributed, as I remember it, to President Wilford Woodruff.\nSome of the brethren of his time are said to have approached him (they had their troubles also\n) and to have inquired of him as to when he felt the end would be&mdash;when would be the\ncoming of the Master? These, I think, are not his exact words, but they convey the spirit of\nhis reported reply: \"I would live as if it were to be tomorrow&mdash;but I am still planting cherry\ntrees!\" I think we may well take this as a page for our own book and live as\nif the end might be tomorrow&mdash;and still plant cherry trees! In worrying about things that are\nbeyond our reach, we should not overlook our opportunities with our own families and\nfriends; in worrying about possible eventualities we should not neglect the things that need to\nbe done here and now, and that are within our reach; the things for which we are immediately\nresponsible; we should not neglect or present opportunities and obligations.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to close with a statement of William Allen White: \"I am not afraid of\ntomorrow, for I have seen yesterday and I love today.\"\n<\/p><p>\nASSURANCE OF EVERLASTING LIVE\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful to my Father in heaven for the assurance in my soul that he lives and that he is\nmindful of his children. I am grateful for his assurance of everlasting life. It has sustained my\nfamily these past three months when two sudden deaths have fallen upon us, and we would\nnot have been sustained except for this assurance. And I would leave with you the witness of\nmy soul that God does live, that Jesus is the Christ, that these things to which we are\ncommitted here in this conference and in this Church are his work and are of divine origin,\nand that it is our responsibility to carry them forward.\n<\/p><p>\nMay his peace be with each of us, and with our children in the perplexing problems that\nconfront them, and give us guidance and give them guidance, I pray in the name of the Lord\nJesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
