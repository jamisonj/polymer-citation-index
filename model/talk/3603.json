[With the help of the Lord,] she mustered all her strength and went. [When she returned home, exhausted, she] collapsed into a large chair and immediately fell into a deep sleep. She said that as she slept she felt as if she were consumed by a fire that would melt the very marrow of her bones.

It is rarely convenient; but love extends beyond convenience for those who have conditioned themselves to look for opportunities to serve. I believe that the Savior was equipped to accomplish His mission not only through His parentage, but because of His thirty years of preparation in developing an awareness of and a sensitivity to the needs of His fellowmen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/love-extends-beyond-convenience.p66\" class=\"\">In Alma, chapter seven, we read:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/love-extends-beyond-convenience.p67\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; \u2026 that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/love-extends-beyond-convenience.p68\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 And he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9341\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9341)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9341)\">Alma 7:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/love-extends-beyond-convenience.p69\" class=\"\">After a recent stake conference meeting where I had discussed the role of the family in the Church, I was approached by a sweet woman who said: \u201cBishop, I\u2019m a widow and I really appreciated everything you said today. I have a lovely family, but I have many problems and I do need help. My priesthood leaders have families of their own and they have lots of problems and I don\u2019t want to bother them and add to their problems. So what should I do?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/love-extends-beyond-convenience.p70\" class=\"\">I asked her, \u201cDo you have a good home teacher who really cares about you?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/love-extends-beyond-convenience.p71\" class=\"\">She said, \u201cYes, I have a home teacher and he comes by every month or so; but he isn\u2019t very involved with our family.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/love-extends-beyond-convenience.p72\" class=\"\">Then I asked, \u201cWell, do you have a visiting teacher who visits you and understands you?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/love-extends-beyond-convenience.p73\" class=\"\">She said, \u201cYes, the Relief Society sometimes comes.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/love-extends-beyond-convenience.p74\" class=\"\">At this point, I was praying for a right answer, when a lovely sister, who was standing nearby and heard our conversation, said, \u201cExcuse me, but I was a widow; and even though I have just remarried, I know how you feel and I understand your problems. Please let me drop by.

I quote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/love-extends-beyond-convenience.p76\" class=\"\">\u201cOne of Dr. (Albert) Schweitzer\u2019s most important concepts is that of the Fellowship of Those who Bear the Mark of Pain. \u2026 Who are its members? Those who have learned by experience what physical pain and bodily anguish mean. These people, all over the world, are united by a secret bond. He who has been delivered from pain must not think he is now \u2026 at liberty to continue his life and forget his sickness. He is a man whose eyes are opened. He now has a duty to help others in their battles with pain and anguish. He must help to bring to others the deliverance which he himself knows.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/love-extends-beyond-convenience.p77\" class=\"\">\u201cUnder this Fellowship come not only those who were formerly sick, but those who are related to sufferers, and whom does this not include?\u201d (Thomas Dooley, \u201cA Worldwide Fellowship,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Words of Wisdom,<\/span> ed.

Each individual Christian \u2026 needs to follow <span class=\"emphasis\">in His steps<\/span> along the path of personal sacrifice to Him. There is not a different path to-day from that of Jesus\u2019 own times.

As I have pondered how practicing welfare principles brings us to Christ, I have searched my own soul and realized that I am far short of my ideal\u2014the Savior.
