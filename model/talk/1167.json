If we were to cover the world with ten\nmillion people in each mission (if my decimal point is put in the right place) it would take\nabout three hundred or some five times more missions than we now have. (If my decimal\npoint is in the wrong place, we are really in trouble!)\n<\/p><p>\nIn a book which Brother William E. Berrett has prepared for priesthood quorum study of\nBook of Mormon subjects and themes, he recalls this startling illustration on population from\nsome years ago: that if all people in the world were to line up thirty-six abreast and pass a\npoint in military marching order, they would never pass completely, because the rate of those\narriving in the world would be such that the parade would be never-ending, and the Church\nand kingdom of God has responsibility for all of them&mdash;however many there are and\nhowever many there may be coming! If we project such figures to the present and the future\nand add to them in geometric ratio, we can glimpse the complexities and the responsibilities.\n<\/p><p>\nI heard, in a great gathering in Tokyo, Dr. Henry Heald, president of the Ford Foundation,\ngive an account of some of the worldwide projects which his organization has undertaken in\nits philanthropic distribution of many millions of dollars among many millions of men, in\ntrying to solve some problems and alleviate some conditions, and he quoted a phrase that may\nbe pertinent to the point at which we have arrived. He spoke of the \"elimination\nof the insignificant,\" and I think it is apparent to all of us that we may have\narrived at that point: the elimination of the insignificant and of the inconsequential. To borrow\na sentence recently read, \"It is getting to where our necessities are too luxurious and our\nluxuries too necessary.\" I think this phrase used by Dr. Heald, the elimination of the\ninconsequential or insignificant, is pertinent to this problem.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the June issue of the Era is a sentence from a poet which says: \"I am full fed, and yet I\nhunger. Now, we have been full fed in many areas, and yet we hunger in others, and we will,\nit seems, have to have a wider distribution of our effort and our influence, the elimination of\nunnecessary duplication, of internal competition, if there is any, and a fuller coverage of some\nneglected areas. We have recognized that there is \"One Lord, one faith, one baptism\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21728\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21728)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21728)\">Eph. 4:5<\/a><\/span>).\nWe must recognize that it is one boy, one girl, one person, with whom we are\nworking and always and ever have in mind what every program does to the person, to the\nman, the boy, the girl, and know that the organizations are there so that there shall be a\nfulness of life for each and all, and not for their own sake or to perpetuate any particular\nprogram. We must have balance and feed all sides of ourselves, as suggested by an eminent\nchurchman who said, \"The Church can be interested in no less than God is interested in.\nReligion has to do with everything.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe gospel enters into everything, and it would not be the purpose of this newly proposed\nprogram, as I understand it, to take anything essential from any area, but to add unto as to\nessentials and to do all things more fully and effectively. And as to superficial or unessential\nthings, I think we must have the courage to look at all programs in the light of present needs,\nas did the founders of these organizations before us, as they brought them into being. This\ndoes not necessarily mean a thinning out of the overall program, but it means a reappraisal,\nand perhaps, if the First Presidency so suggests a redistribution, a redefinition, and an\nabridgment in unessential areas, a better use of time, of effort, and energy. It could mean, and\nwell could, I would suppose, more emphasis on the home.\n<\/p><p>\nI am thinking of a phrase: flexibility and firmness. These the Church must have: the\nflexibility to change, to meet conditions as they come, with firmness of principles and of\ninstruction and of gospel precepts and commandments, never tampering with the solid\nfoundations, but ever keeping flexible in meeting current conditions and being discriminating\nas between what is superstructure and what is bedrock foundation, and always being prepared\nto make the necessary adjustment between the two.\n<\/p><p>\nOur opportunities with young people are perishable. We are aware of this as young men leave\nus, sometimes suddenly, under the circumstances in which we live, and this calls for the\nteaching of the whole gospel to everyone, and perhaps earlier than we have before, in a\nwell-rounded program that will reach every person on all facets and all sides of himself.\nThere is no magic formula for it except the simple teaching of the truth to everyone in an\norderly program and procedure.\n<\/p><p>\nThis would not necessarily change the names or basic traditions of any organizations, but it\nwould define them and prescribe their function as to each area and as to any overlapping.\nThis will require more of everything from all of us, this great growth of the Church and the\nextending of our organization and influence&mdash;more of our tithes, more of our time, more of\nour offerings and our effort, as we seek to absorb those who come to us as well as those who\nalready are with us.\n<\/p><p>\nNow may I close with one or two short quotes, one from the Psalmist, which I think is\npertinent to this program as proposed: \"Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain\npath\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41821\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41821)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41821)\">Ps. 27:11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe other, which I borrow from a distinguished friend, as I heard him give it at a meeting far\nfrom here: \"Face the future courageously and with determination. Echo not the cowardly\nwords of the nerveless Hamlet who voiced the thought, familiar to all, 'the time is\nout of joint: Oh, cursed spite, that I was ever born to set it right!' Cry,\nrather, with Rupert Brooke who, sailing, for the hard campaign in Gallipoli, declared, 'Now\nGod be thanked who hath matched us with this hour.'\"\n<\/p><p>\nWith you, I thank God that we are matched with this how and, with you, pray for his\nguidance and acknowledge to him our thanks for the prophet who leads us, who directs this\nprogram, who has long had it close to his heart, and pray with you that it may go forward for\nthe simplification, the elimination of all duplications and competition and unessentials, and the\nenriching of all that is essential in every life, everywhere in the world.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, my brethren. I leave with you my witness of the truth of this work, of the\nreality that God lives, of the divinity of his Son, our Savior, and of the reality of the\nrestoration of the gospel, and the inspired leadership of the prophet of the present time, and I\ndo it in Jesus' name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
