For that Spirit I earnestly pray.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the great land in which I am privileged to work in the missionary cause with many of your\nchoice sons and daughters, a clergyman recently issued a statement, urging his people not to\nlisten to the representatives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as they seek to\nconverse with them. He urged the people not to \"surrender the substance for the shadow.\"\nThis latter admonition is interesting and should receive the most serious consideration. I have\nbeen thinking all through this conference, as testimony and witness have been borne as to God\nand Christ and the relationship of man to them, as to the eternal nature of life, the reality of\nthe resurrection, the profound importance and absolute validity of the restoration, \"Where is\nthe substance? Where is the shadow?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis inquiry would be valid and of great interest in every aspect of religious faith and\npractice. Comparisons of the revealed word of God and the Church established on the earth\nby Christ and his apostles with presently existing churches and their creeds and organizations\nand practices would be interesting. I commend to you this experience. For today, let me\ncenter attention on one theme to which the clergyman's suggestion is pertinent.\n<\/p><p>\nIt has been my blessing for many years to work among the young and among those who work\nwith the young. Recently it has been my especial privilege to labor with several hundred\nchoice young men and women, serving as missionaries in a foreign land. I believe I know\nbetter today than I have ever known in my life how substantial and remarkable and marvelous\nare the blessings of God to this Church in these days. He has blessed us with substance in a\nday when mists of darkness shadow the land. Ours is a family-centered religion, our families\nare religion-centered, and the gospel as we understand it affects the total personality and all of\nthe aspects of the life of the individual child of God. What do the young people need? What\ncan we offer them of real substance which will help them to avoid the shadows of falsehood\nand failure and sin and sorrow?\n<\/p><p>\nThere are some suggestions I'd like to make, not to the young and not especially or at least\nuniquely to their parents, but to all of us, including parents, who deal with and influence or\nhave great potential to influence and bless the young.\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure as I begin, that we are united, you and I and all people of goodwill and honest\nintent throughout the world, as to the objectives we may desire for the young. I don't know a\nsingle parent or other honorable human being who does not want for the young a decent,\nconstructive, contributing, happy life. Many of us would like to help youth, though many give\nonly lip-service to their need for help. What would we want for them? Oh, I'd like my son to\nwin an Olympic event. This would delight me, please me greatly, make me proud. I'd like my\nlittle boy to be a fine surgeon or lawyer or salesman, or whatever he chooses to be. But if he\nwere to succeed at some significant service and fail to be an honest, ethical, moral, spiritually\nperceptive man, I would be a failure and a sad father, in my own eyes. What good people\nwant for youngsters is constructive, happy, participating lives.\n<\/p><p>\nIt would seem likely that we are united also in our estimate of their value as individual\nchildren of God. They are infinitely valuable. Do you know the poem\n<\/p><p>\n\"Nobody knows what a boy is worth,<br \/>\n     We'll have to wait and see.<br \/>\n     But every man in a noble place<br \/>\n     A boy once used to be.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBishop Simpson's allusion to the Second World War brought to my mind a story which\nimpresses me greatly as to the value of one individual and the impact of one life in the lives\nof others.\n<\/p><p>\nThe first great B-29 strike on those who were then our enemy, flown from a land base, was\nled by an airplane named \"City of Los Angeles.\" (There had been previous strikes from\ncarriers, but this was our first flown from our own airfields recovered from the enemy. It was\nmeant to inform him that the war was now to be carried to his own homeland, and it was a\nvery important mission.) Aboard the aircraft were twelve men, eleven regular crewmen and a\ncolonel flying as squadron commander for the mission. They were to reach a rendezvous point\n50 to 75 miles off the mainland of the enemy, then assume regular fighting formation and fly\nin on target, which was a complex of high octane gasoline plants feeding the enemy war\npotential.\n<\/p><p>\nRendezvous point was reached as scheduled, and Colonel Sprouse ordered the dropping of the\nphosphorous bomb which was to mark the point. Sergeant \"Red\" Irwin skidded the bomb\ndown the chute as ordered. The act was loaded with death. The flap at the end of the bomb\nchute had somehow become stuck. When the bomb struck it, it exploded prematurely and\nburst back into the cabin of the airplane and into the face and chest of Sergeant Irwin.\nDropping to the deck it began swiftly to burn its way through the thin metal flooring\nseparating it from the incendiary bombs stored in the bomb bay below. In moments the \"City\nof Los Angeles\" and its crew would be blown to bits far out over the ocean in enemy\nterritory.\n<\/p><p>\nSergeant Irwin, tragically wounded, got to his knees, picked up the bomb in his bare hands,\ncradled it in his arms, and staggered up the passageway. Crashing into the navigator's table,\nhe had to stop and unlatch it with fingers that left burn marks in the hardwood. By now the\naircraft was filled with acrid fumes, blinding the pilot, and was wallowing less than 300 feet\nabove the water. Irwin staggered into the pilot's compartment shouting \"Window, window.\"\nHe could not see that it was already open, and his fumbling fingers left burn marks on the\nmetal. He threw the bomb out of the window and collapsed to the deck. Two hours later,\nColonel Sprouse having ordered the \"City of Los Angeles\" back to base in the slim hope that\nIrwin's life might be saved, they reached Iwo Jima. Irwin's flesh was still smoking with\nimbedded phosphorous when he was removed from the plane by comrades who had to avert\ntheir faces from his tragic wounds.\n<\/p><p>\nSergeant Irwin lived to receive his nation's highest honor for extreme bravery and to survive\nnearly fifty plastic surgery operations which restored him to a somewhat normal life. He lived\nto marry and to become a father. And with him, there lived eleven other men who but for his\nalmost unbelievable courage would be dead. Eleven men, spared to their lives and work and\nfamilies through the decision and courageous act of one man! When Sergeant Irwin picked up\nthat bomb, he knew that it was burning at 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit, 1,088 degrees hotter than\nboiling water!\n<\/p><p>\nThis dramatic story came out of a war, but its implications are applicable to each of us, to our\nfamilies, communities, nations. How many young people are there in your home or\nneighborhood, choice young children of God, who are wanting for lack of someone who has\nthe courage and concern to interest himself or herself in their welfare? The prime\nresponsibility, of course, is in the home, and we are as a Church and people anxiously\ninterested in strengthening our homes and families. But we are aware that there are literally\nmillions of youngsters who are not receiving in their homes the care they desperately need.\nThey are the legitimate concern of all of us.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat can we do for them?\n<\/p><p>\nI offer these quick suggestions in headlines only. The rest of the story, each of us may fashion\nas we will. I believe them to be the substance of youthful success and joy.\n<\/p><p>\n1. Be concerned with their welfare. Recognize their worth and our potential\nto bless them and influence them and help them and lift them.\n<\/p><p>\n2. Understand that they are different They are not all out of one mold. They are at varying\nlevels of spiritual and social and intellectual maturity, even though they may be the same age.\nThey must be accepted and dealt with as individuals, as they are, and in terms of what they\ncan be, and helped to become the best that they can be.\n<\/p><p>\n3. They need to be taught. They need instruction. Someone has said that we habitually\noverestimate their experience and underestimate their intelligence. We expect them to act like\nlittle adults, and yet we fail to take time and interest to teach them.\n<\/p><p>\nAt a meeting in England a few weeks ago a little girl, perhaps younger than four years of age,\nwalked into a hall where a film and lecture were to be presented. I watched her as she stepped\ndaintily over a moving picture projector cord. A man standing near the machine to protect it\nfrom accidental damage said to her, \"Sweetheart, hurry and sit down. We're going to start.\"\nShe <i>sat<\/i> down, right there in the middle of the aisle, smiling sweetly at those around her. He\npicked her up and explained that he had wanted her to sit up in front on a chair and then\nescorted her there.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, as the father of five children I am not blind to reality. I know that they don't always do\nwhat we tell them, but if we have a proper appreciation of their value and of our ability to\ninfluence them, if we will accept them as they are and teach them in a spirit of love,\nwonderful blessings will come to them and to us. Let me add it as a special and significant\npoint: \n<\/p><p>\n4. We must really love them. We can afford to make the mistakes of the inexpert if we\nsincerely love them.\n<\/p><p>\n5. They need discipline. They need to realize that there are rules, wise and fair rules, which\napply to them, lack of conformity to which brings a penalty.\n<\/p><p>\nYou will remember the wonderful counsel given by the Lord to Joseph Smith in response to\nhis anguished cry from the dungeon at Liberty, Missouri, where he had been cruelly confined\nfor months, away from his friends and loved ones. The spirit of the priesthood was movingly\nexplained and direction given as to how it must be used. Included was this remarkable\nstatement: \"Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then\nshowing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he\nesteem thee to be his enemy\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14220\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14220)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14220)\">D&amp;C 121:43<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYoung people need discipline, administered in love.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the great state of Vermont a few months ago I faced an unruly crowd of choice teenagers\nbrought from all regions in the state. They had listened to good music, had heard the mayors\nand the governor, and had responded to every effort with contempt and discourtesy. The\nperson who introduced me was quite apologetic. I think he wished that I would disappear, so\nembarrassing had been the behavior of the young people to that moment. I stood up and said\nsomething I hadn't ever said before to a group of teens. I said, \"I'm sorry that most of you\ndidn't hear the great talk that your governor just delivered. It was a wonderful talk, and you\nwould have profited from hearing it, but you weren't listening. Let me repeat the theme of\nwhat your governor said. He talked about 'Vermont's Chief Asset, Her Teenagers.' I'd like to\ntell you the truth. I'd like to tell you that I've been all over America commending your\ngeneration and expressing confidence in you, and tonight you have made me wonder. For the\nfirst time you've really made me wonder. I'd just like to tell you that if your behavior tonight\nis typical, if you've been acting as you really are, and if you are Vermont's chief asset, the\nLord help Vermont.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWell, they listened. I spent the next forty-five minutes showing forth an increase of love\ntoward them, talking to the theme of \"Moral Courage.\" I did my best to recover from what\nmight be thought a very strange way to approach a group of young people. They didn't move\na muscle. They listened, and their response was wonderful.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the meeting was over, I walked out of the building and was stopped on the path outside\nby a rather grim-looking group of handsome, rugged young men. One of them stepped for-\nward and said, \"Mr. Hanks, we were very grateful for your talk on moral\ncourage. We learned a lot. But we'd like you to know that what you did here tonight was lots\nmore important than anything you said, and we're never going to forget it.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYoung people need to be disciplined in love.\n<\/p><p>\n6. They need wholesome participation with others.\n<\/p><p>\n7. Young people need to be encouraged to stretch, to develop their creative capacities.\n<\/p><p>\n8. They need to be taught and given experience in the great religious truths. Would you bless\nyouth? Teach them the truth about God and Christ and themselves. Teach them that they have\na special responsibility toward God and all their fellow men, his children. Teach them to be\ncompassionate and considerate and kind, which they can best be when they know God as their\ntrue Father in whose image and likeness they are created; when they know Christ as their\nliving Savior; when they recognize themselves as choice, responsible children of God,\nbrothers to all men. Lead them to religious search and service and reverence. Help them to\nlearn the truth.\n<\/p><p>\n9. Be an example to them of what you'd like them to be.\n<\/p><p>\nI testify that God lives, that we are his children, and that we can bless each other and our\nchoice young brothers and sisters if we will. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
