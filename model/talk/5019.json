Scudder brings to the surface tender feelings held in the heart:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/never-alone.p21\" class=\"\">A friend of his happened to be sitting in a railroad coach next to a young man who was obviously depressed. Finally the young man revealed that he was a paroled convict returning from a distant prison. His imprisonment had brought shame to his family, and they had neither visited him nor written often. He hoped, however, that this was only because they were too poor to travel and too uneducated to write. He hoped, despite the evidence, that they had forgiven him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/never-alone.p22\" class=\"\">To make it easy for them, however, he had written to them asking that they put up a signal for him when the train passed their little farm on the outskirts of town. If his family had forgiven him, they were to put up a white ribbon in the big apple tree which stood near the tracks. If they didn\u2019t want him to return, they were to do nothing, and he would remain on the train as it traveled onward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/never-alone.p23\" class=\"\">As the train neared his hometown, the suspense became so great that he couldn\u2019t bear to look out of his window. He exclaimed, \u201cIn just five minutes the engineer will sound the whistle indicating our approach to the long bend which opens into the valley I know as home. Will you watch for the apple tree at the side of the track?\u201d His companion said he would; they exchanged places. The minutes seemed like hours, but then there came the shrill sound of the train whistle. The young man asked, \u201cCan you see the tree? Is there a white ribbon?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/never-alone.p24\" class=\"\">Came the reply, \u201cI see the tree. I see not one white ribbon, but many.

Indeed, he had witnessed a miracle.

However, the message is the same: \u201cWelcome home!\u201d Men, women, and children everywhere are tying yellow ribbons around everything. Not only are they being tied around trees, but also around lampposts, street signs, and mailboxes\u2014even about the necks of pets. So overwhelming is the demand for yellow ribbon material that busy suppliers working around the clock cannot meet the need. A classic yellow bow was one which completely girdled a large plane bringing soldiers safely home. I have surmised that each one who tenderly tied a yellow bow was singing, humming, or at least thinking of the words of the song \u201cTie a Yellow Ribbon \u2018Round the Old Oak Tree.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/never-alone.p27\" class=\"\">In the warm and poignant airport scene of a family awaiting a returning father and husband, smiles and tears of gratitude were everywhere to be found. My eye caught the expression of a small boy holding aloft a stick around which was tied a yellow ribbon. No words could describe the unspoken feeling. It is the welcome home of the heart that brings tears to every eye and peace to every soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/never-alone.p28\" class=\"\">Children have the capacity for compassion. They have no fear to express their genuine feelings. In the popular movie entitled <span class=\"emphasis\">Home Alone,<\/span> a scene near the end grips the viewer\u2019s emotions and causes that familiar lump to fill the throat. The scene takes place in a chapel; the time is Christmas; the two lonely characters are seated next to one another on a church bench. The older man, who lives by himself, is estranged from family and bereft of friends. His next-door neighbor, played by McCaulay Culkin, is the lad left \u201chome alone\u201d by his family, which had departed for a European vacation, inadvertently forgetting this one small family member.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/never-alone.p29\" class=\"\">The boy asks the lonely man if he has any family. The gentleman explains quietly that he and his son and his son\u2019s family have parted ways and no longer communicate. In the innocence of youth, the boy blurts out the plea, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just call your son and tell him you are sorry and invite him home for Christmas!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/never-alone.p30\" class=\"\">The old man sighs and responds, \u201cI\u2019m too afraid he would say no.\u201d The fear of failure had blocked the ability to express love and to voice an apology.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/never-alone.p31\" class=\"\">The viewer is left to wonder concerning the outcome of the conversation, but not for too long. Christmas comes; the boy\u2019s family returns. He is pictured at an upstairs bedroom window looking in the direction of the old man\u2019s sidewalk. Suddenly he views a tender scene as the neighbor welcomes his returning son, his daughter-in-law, and their children. Son embraces father, and the old man buries his head against the shoulder of his precious son. As they turn to walk on, the old neighbor looks upward to the bedroom window of the house next door and sees his small friend observing the private miracle of forgiveness. Their eyes meet, their hands express a gentle greeting of gratitude. \u201cWelcome home\u201d replaces \u201cHome alone.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/05\/never-alone.p32\" class=\"\">One emerges from the theater with moist eyes.
