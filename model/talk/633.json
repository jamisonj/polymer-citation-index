I thank the Lord for the inspiration of this conference.\nI could wish that it might go on not for two more days but for five or ten. I have thrilled with\nthe proceedings of the day and with the sweet, quiet, peaceful influence that is here. The past\nthree months have, to a degree at least, been a study in contrasts.\n<\/p><p>\nI am sure, my brethren and sisters, you will never know how very deeply I appreciate my\nassociations in the Church. I appreciate the hundreds and thousands of messages that have\ncome from all parts of this nation and foreign countries expressing confidence and love and\ngiving assurance of your faith and prayers in the new assignment which came to one of the\nhumblest of your number.\n<\/p><p>\nYou will never know how deeply I have missed the experiences in the Church that have been\nmine from week to week during the past eight years. Of course I have missed my family and\nthe peace and quiet and love of my home, and I want you to know how much I appreciate the\nmessages that have come following a near-tragic accident to two of my loved ones. Messages\nhave been received from all over the Church and from outside as well.\n<\/p><p>\nI want you to know how much I have missed the weekly visits to stake conferences, the\nopportunity of visiting in the missions. I want you to know how deeply I have missed the\nassociations with my brethren of the General Authorities. I have missed the opportunity of\nperforming sacred ordinances of blessing people at stake conferences and at the Church\nOffices. I have missed very deeply the privilege of performing ordinations and setting apart\nmy brethren to positions of trust in the Church and kingdom of God. I have missed the visits\nof humble members of the Church to my office in the Church Office Building.\n<\/p><p>\nI have missed the opportunity to go to the temple frequently to perform sacred ordinances, to\nofficiate at marriages for young couples, and to have the opportunity of visiting with them\nintimately before and after marriage. I have missed very much my contact with the youth of\nthe Church and with the great Mutual Improvement Associations with which I have had the\npleasure, under the direction of the First Presidency, of serving.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I have missed, even more, those Thursday meetings in the temple with my brethren, the\nsacred hour of prayer around the altar in the temple of God, and I have missed the meetings\nwith the members of the Twelve as we have assembled quarterly. I have also missed the fast\ndays on the first Thursday of the month.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been deeply grateful for the good people of the Washington Stake under the faithful\nleadership of Brother J. Willard Marriott, for their kindness, their love, and their\nunderstanding.\n<\/p><p>\nI think my testimony of the truth has never been so strong as it is today. I love this work. I\nknow that God stands at the head of it, that he lives, that he is directing this work on the\nearth. I know that his priesthood and power and authority are here among men, and I know,\nmy brethren and sisters, better than I have ever known before that, even during hours of trial\nand anxiety, it is possible to draw close to the Lord, to feel of his influence and of his\nsustaining power&mdash;that one is never alone, if he will only humble himself before the\nAlmighty. I am grateful for that testimony, for that assurance.\n<\/p><p>\nI know, my brethren and sisters, that the sweetest work in all the world is the work in which\nwe are engaged in helping to save and exalt the souls of the children of men.\nThere isn't anything so important, so precious, so enjoyable, so soul-satisfying.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been happy in the privilege to serve, in a small way at least, this great country and the\ngovernment under which we live. I am grateful to the First Presidency and my brethren that\nthey have been willing, not only to give consent, but also to give me their blessing as I\nresponded to the call of the chief executive. I am grateful for their prayers and their faith, and\nI know that my leaving has, in a small way at least, added to the heavy load they were\nalready carrying.\n<\/p><p>\nTo me it is a great honor and a privilege to serve the government of the United States of\nAmerica. Our problems are numerous, complex, and difficult. The responsibility is heavy but\nI have felt the power of the faith and prayers of the Saints and Christian people generally\nthroughout this nation, who believe in many of those eternal principles that are embodied in\nthe gospel, the principles for which we stand as a people.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful that I have been able to get men closely associated with me who love America,\nwho believe that the Constitution of this land embodies eternal principles. They are men of\nfaith, men who are willing to join with me weekly in prayer in our staff meetings, men who\nlove our free institutions, men who want to keep America strong, men who are willing to\nsacrifice financially in order to serve the government of the United States, this blessed land in\nwhich we live.\n<\/p><p>\nThese men believe firmly that the supreme test of any policy, whether it be agricultural or\notherwise, is this: How will it affect the morale, the character, and the well-being of our\npeople? They are men who know that we need, and the world needs, a strong America for the\ncritical years ahead; men, whose philosophy of life squares with the philosophy which has\ncome to me through the teachings of the Church and kingdom of God, a philosophy which is\nbased upon eternal principles which to me are priceless, a philosophy which teaches that\nfreedom is a God-given, eternal principle vouchsafed to us under the Constitution.\n<\/p><p>\nThis freedom must be continually guarded as something more priceless than life itself. Any\nprogram that would tend to weaken this freedom is inherently dangerous and should be\nguarded against. I will not say more today about this philosophy&mdash;this philosophy of\nindividual freedom and citizenship responsibility, based upon the principle of helping the\nindividual to help himself, and discouraging people from expecting the government to support\nthem, but encouraging them to support their own government. I am grateful for this\nphilosophy, and I am grateful to learn that this philosophy is accepted generally and rather\nwidely in the hearts of our people throughout this land. I hope and pray that it may be\naccepted even to a greater extent in the days ahead. I trust that our great purpose shall be to\nstrengthen the individual integrity, freedom, and moral fiber of each citizen.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren and sisters, I love this great nation in which we live. To me it is not just another\nnation. It is my firm belief that the God of heaven raised up the founding fathers and inspired\nthem to establish the Constitution of this land\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13165\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13165)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13165)\">D&amp;C 101:80<\/a><\/span>),\nand I believe that is Mormon doctrine. This is\na part of my religious faith as it is of yours. This is a great and glorious nation, with a\nGod-given, divine mission to perform for liberty-loving people everywhere. This mission\ncannot be performed unless America is kept strong and virile, unless this people adheres to\nthose eternal principles embodied in the gospel and in the Constitution of our land.\n<\/p><p>\nSo today I pray to God that no act of mine or program that I shall ever advocate will in the\nslightest tend to weaken this nation in the accomplishment of that God-given mandate.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my brethren and sisters, we have recently, since our last general conference, passed\nthrough a great political campaign in which we have exercised our freedom,\nour God-given right at the polls. I rejoice in this privilege, that we have been able to go to the\npolls and express ourselves freely, with heads erect, unafraid. We have differed, as is our\nprivilege, and I pray to God we may never lose this privilege. Many of us have supported\nmen who were not elected. The American people spoke on election day. We chose one of our\nnumber as the chief executive, and he has a tremendous responsibility.\n<\/p><p>\nI was impressed with that responsibility a few days ago when I was invited to attend a prayer\nbreakfast at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington D. C. Gathered there at an early hour were\nmen of various political faiths various religious affiliations. Brief messages were given;\nprayers were offered. We heard an inspirational message from the President of the United\nStates. I sat at a table with the Vice President, a prominent congressman from up in the\nnorthwest, several southern Democratic friends, and as we visited together and enjoyed the\ninspiration of that occasion, I couldn't help thanking God that in America it is still possible\nfor men of differing political faiths to come together and in unity appeal to the Almighty for\nhis blessings upon this land of America and him who has been called to serve as the chief\nexecutive.\n<\/p><p>\nOne piece of literature distributed at that meeting came from Conrad L. Hilton, the head of\nthe Hilton chain of hotels. It was a picture of Uncle Sam upon his knees in prayer. I learned\nfrom Mr. Hilton later that this had come as a result of an address he had given in Chicago\nover one of the national broadcasting chains in which he had tried to point out that if we are\ngoing to have victory in our battle for peace, then it must be obtained through greater\nspirituality and dependence upon the Almighty. The response to his message, through letters\nand telegrams, seemed to carry one theme from people of various walks of life from all over\nAmerica. The theme was that final victory rests not on munitions upon money or soldiers but\nthat the final victory rests with the God of heaven.\n<\/p><p>\nMr. Hilton was so impressed that he tried to picture this sentiment by showing Uncle\nSam&mdash;America&mdash;on his knees in prayer. \". . . not beaten there by hammer and sickle,\" as he\nsaid, \"but freely, intelligently, responsibly, confidently, powerfully.\" And then were added\nthese words, \"America now knows it can destroy communism and win the battle for peace.\nWe need fear nothing or no one . . . except God.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen there was penned a simple prayer beside this picture of Uncle Sam. I have taken the\nliberty of changing the pronoun in that prayer that it might conform with our language of\nprayer as we use it in the Church. I would like to read it to you: \n<\/p><p>\nOur Father in heaven: \n<\/p><p>\nWe pray that thou wilt save us from ourselves.\n<\/p><p>\nThe world that thou hast made for us, to live in peace, we have\nmade into an armed camp.\nWe live in fear of war to come.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are afraid of \"the terror that flies by night, and the arrow\nthat flies by day, the pestilence that walks in darkness and\nthe destruction that wastes at noonday.\nWe have turned from thee to go our selfish way.\nWe have broken thy commandments and denied thy truth. We have\nleft thine altars to serve the false gods of money and\npleasure and power.\n<\/p><p>\nForgive us and help us.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, darkness gathers around us, and we are confused in all our\ncounsels. Losing faith in thee, we lose faith in ourselves.\n<\/p><p>\nInspire us with wisdom, all of us of every color, race, and\ncreed, to use our wealth, our strength to help our brother,\ninstead of destroying him.\n<\/p><p>\nHelp us to do thy will as it is done in heaven and to be worthy\nof thy promise of peace on earth.\n<\/p><p>\nFill us with new faith, new strength, and new courage, that we\nmay win the battle for peace.\n<\/p><p>\nBe swift to save us, dear God, before the darkness falls.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my brethren and sisters, a written prayer is not enough. A spoken prayer is not enough.\nIf we are going to realize the hope that is in the hearts of all of us, then as American citizens,\nas Latter-day Saints, we must live worthy of the blessings for which we pray.\n<\/p><p>\nIn closing, I would like to appeal to the Latter-day Saints, and all within the range of my\nvoice today, that we seek to promote a spirit of humility throughout this great land, that we\npray for the President of the United States. He is our President. He needs our faith and\nprayers. He has my confidence, as do the men associated with him in the cabinet.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we bow our heads in prayer in cabinet meeting each Friday morning, I thank God that we\nstill have in America men of faith who are not too proud to bow before the Almighty and\nseek his inspiration. We may not agree with all of the President's policies, and I hope if we\ndo not, we will express ourselves vigorously and freely, either policies advocated or policies\nadopted. I hope the issues will be debated freely from one end of the land to the other\nbecause therein is safety. There is always safety in an informed public.\n<\/p><p>\nBut let us pray that the chief executive will make no serious mistakes. Let us pray for the\nCongress of the United States. They are made up mostly of good men, fine public servants,\nwho want to do what is right. They also want to please their constituents, and I hope you will\nbe wise in what you ask of them. Don't ask them for anything that is unsound. Don't put\nyour own selfish, narrow desires ahead of the public welfare. Give our legislators your faith\nand your prayers.\n<\/p><p>\nPray also for the great judicial branch of the government&mdash;these men who have been called\nand given the great responsibility of interpreting the laws of the land. May they have the\npower and influence of the Spirit of heaven that as they interpret those laws they may do so\nin keeping with the spirit of the Constitution in a manner pleasing to our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us, my brethren and sisters, as Latter-day Saints, that we may wield our influence\nto the very maximum in promoting peace, in promoting spirituality among the people of this\ngreat nation, that this great country of which we are a part, may be preserved, and may\ncontinue to be, through all the days to come, a beacon and an inspiration to liberty-loving\npeople everywhere. God grant his blessings to this people and upon this great land, I humbly\npray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
