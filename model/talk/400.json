Wirthlin, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1949, pp. 155-161<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI sincerely trust, my brethren and sisters, that I might enjoy an interest in your faith and\nprayers.\n<\/p><p>\nThis great conference has been a most impressive one. As I listened to the addresses of our\nbeloved President George Albert Smith, President Clark, and President McKay, members of\nthe Council of the Twelve, and all who have addressed us, and listened to the most inspiring\nmusic, the thought came into my mind, \"Count your many blessings, count them one by one,\nand see what the Lord has done.\"\n<\/p><p>\nA BLESSED PEOPLE\n<\/p><p>\nWe are a blessed people. We have the blessing of membership in the restored Church of the\nLord Jesus Christ. We enjoy a divinely authorized leadership who receive the mind and will\nof our Heavenly Father. We have the privilege of enjoying citizenship in a great republic. We\nhave the privilege of associating with one another as brethren and sisters in the true sense of\nthe term. We have our families. We have so many blessings that time does not permit to\nenumerate them all.\n<\/p><p>\nBut have we ever stopped to think that all of these blessings have come to us because of\nsomeone else's faith, someone else's work, someone else's prayers? I never think of this\nChurch and its organization but what there comes to my mind the story of a boy who was\nconfused as to which church he should join. And in studying the scriptures, he came upon that\nmemorable admonition found in James, wherein the Lord said this:\n<\/p><p>\nIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth\nnot; and it shall be given him.\n<\/p><p>\nBut let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea\ndriven with the wind and tossed\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26073\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26073)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26073)\">James 1:5-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis fourteen year old boy took this admonition to heart, and going out into the woods, he\nsupplicated God with a faith that was implicit; and in answer to that prayer, God the Eternal\nFather and his Son appeared to him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30276\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30276)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30276)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;that\nsame God that Adam knew, the God of Moses, and\nAbraham, and Jacob, and all of the other ancient servants of the Lord&mdash;that same God who\nspoke from the heavens when his Son, Jesus Christ, was being baptized in the River Jordan,\nand the voice of God was heard saying:\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34243\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34243)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34243)\">Matt. 3:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, out of the supplication, and the prayers, and the works of a humble boy, used as the\ninstrument in the hands of God, the Church of Jesus Christ was restored to the earth, and the\ngospel in its fulness and simplicity was returned for the salvation and exaltation of the Lord's\nchildren.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd along with the restoration, there came the priesthood of God whereby we might enjoy\nleadership inspired by revelation; men who are humble and men who have but one desire, and\nthat is to serve God in such a way that they might do the most good for his people and for\nthe world.\n<\/p><p>\nFAITH OF GEORGE WASHINGTON\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I think of the founders of this great republic, I think of George Washington. There is\nno question but what he was an instrument of God in the founding of a nation where the\nChurch might be restored and where the gospel might be returned to mankind, because this\nnation is founded upon the great cornerstone of the gospel, namely that of free agency. But,\nunfortunately, there are those among us who would have us believe that George Washington\nwas an unbeliever; but I want to tell you that if a man ever had the help of Almighty God,\nthat man was the Father of our country. I think of him at Valley Forge, standing at the head\nof a hungry, ragged, cold army&mdash;discouraged, many of them returning to their homes. George\nWashington had to work with a Continental Congress that was unable to supply him with the\nsinews of war. I am sure that George Washington, in that hour, realized that in and of himself\nhe could never gain victory; and being a God-fearing man, there is no question but what he\nsought wisdom from on high, and he received it, because thereafter, this same ragged army\ndefeated the haughty Cornwallis at Yorktown and made it possible to open up the way\nwhereby this great republic in which you and I enjoy citizenship was founded.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I think of those who framed the Constitution of the United States. They were prayerful\nmen; for the Lord made it known to the Prophet Joseph that he permitted the Constitution to\nbe established by good and wise men. It is true that when the members of that assembly came\ntogether there was some dissension, some differences of opinion, but one day there arose\namong them an old patriot who made the suggestion that as the assembly open each day they\nsupplicate God for his help to the end that they might have wisdom. And God was\nsupplicated, and as the great Gladstone said:\n<\/p><p>\nThe Constitution of the United States is the greatest document ever stricken off by the hand of\nman in a given period of time.\n<\/p><p>\nPRAYERS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN\n<\/p><p>\nAnd there was another man who sought wisdom from God. That great leader who preserved\nthe Union, namely, Abraham Lincoln, a man who was scorned and held in disdain even by\nthose who were closely associated with him. And when the day of the battle of Gettysburg\ncame, he was composed, he was calm. After the battle was over and the victory had been\nwon, General Sickles asked him the question: \"How was it that you seemed to be so calm and\ncomposed when the rest of us were worried?\" And here is the answer of that great man to the\ngeneral. Said he:\n<\/p><p>\nIn the pinch of your campaign up there, when everybody seemed panic-stricken and nobody\ncould tell what was going to happen, oppressed by the gravity of our affairs, I went to my\nroom one day and locked the door and got down upon my knees before Almighty God and\nprayed to him mightily for victory at Gettysburg. I told him that this war was his, and our\ncause his cause, that we could not stand another Fredericksburg or Chancellorsville. Then and\nthere I made a solemn vow to Almighty God that if he would stand by our boys at\nGettysburg, I would stand by him, and he did stand by you boys, and I will stand by him.\nAnd after that, I don't know how it was, and I cannot explain it, soon a sweet comfort crept\ninto my soul. The feeling came that God had taken the whole business into his own hands,\nand that things would go right at Gettysburg, and that was why I had no fears about you.\n<\/p><p>\nThis great man followed the admonition of James, too, and sought wisdom from on high; and\nas a result of his faith and his prayers, the army at Gettysburg was able to achieve the final\nvictory.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then, too, I think of the pioneers, as they made the great trek across the plains and\nthrough the rugged defiles of these mighty mountains. It is said in the diaries of some of them\nat the close of each day, \"Brigham Young and his associates went to the highest hill and there\nsupplicated God for direction.\" It seemed that they liked to pray on the heights, on the\nmountains, and the hills. I have sometimes thought that the reason for that was that they not\nonly wanted to get close to God spiritually, but they also wanted to get near to him\nphysically. And so out of their prayers and seeking divine wisdom from on high, it was\npossible for them to find this place in the West that God had reserved for them; and out of\ntheir work, prayers, and divine wisdom you and I today are living in one of the grandest\nplaces upon the whole earth.\n<\/p><p>\nDIVINE GUIDANCE NEEDED\n<\/p><p>\nWe are now facing another day with more problems. We have now come to the time when\nthis nation stands at the crossroads. A road, which, if we continue to follow it without\nquestion will take us down the path of socialism and communism. Let me say to you that\nonce we are in the shackles of either one of these, we will lose our free agency and merely\nbecome the pawns of lustful, godless leaders. This is the day and time when the leaders of\nthis nation and all of us as citizens of this great country should follow the admonition of\nJames, seek wisdom from on high, divine guidance that we may be able to solve our national\nproblems and preserve for unborn generations the same blessings of citizenship and freedom\nthat you and I have enjoyed.\n<\/p><p>\nI was thrilled some few years ago when I heard a United States senator say that every\nmorning he and a few of his companions went into a small room in the Capitol Building, and\nthere they supplicated God for direction. I would that every one of our representatives in the\nnational assembly would supplicate God every day. Just as surely as they would do that, there\nwould come to them that wisdom, that divine direction, which would preserve this nation as a\ngreat republic and also the principles for which it stands.\n<\/p><p>\nRESPONSIBILITY, TO BE PRAYERFUL\n<\/p><p>\nNow, you and I have some definite responsibilities too&mdash;the responsibility of being prayerful,\nthat we will remember in our prayers those who guide and direct the destiny of this nation to\nthe end that God will touch their hearts and out of it all we will be able to follow that path\nlaid down by George Washington, and the path of Abraham Lincoln, to the end that we may\nfollow it for our own happiness and joy and for those who shall follow after us.\n<\/p><p>\nOf all the people in the world, we should be the most prayerful; we should follow the\nadmonition of James and seek God continually for wisdom from on high. For the Lord has\nsaid to us through his Prophet:\n<\/p><p>\nOrganize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of\nprayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of\norder, a house of God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12696\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12696)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12696)\">D&amp;C 88:119<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd there is no reason why every Latter-day Saint home should not be a house of God; for,\nin most instances, there stands at the head of every Latter-day Saint home a servant of\nAlmighty God holding the priesthood and having the right to call upon God and supplicate\nhim for the benefit and the blessings and the good of those who reside within his household.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has made it plain to us that if we are not a prayerful people, if we fail to remember\nthe king of this land, Jesus Christ, we can lose all of these blessings. We should harken to the\nwords of Amulek when he said to his people:\n<\/p><p>\nYea, I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the\nland that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as\nwere the people in the days of Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the\nsword.\n<\/p><p>\nBut it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared; now therefore, if ye will cast out\nthe righteous from among you then will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he\nwill come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the\nsword; and the time is soon at hand except ye repent\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8868\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8868)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8868)\">Alma 10:22-23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so it seems to me that what we need in this fair land of ours is a shining example of\nprayerfulness and the Latter-day Saints are the people who are chosen to exemplify to the\nworld the power of prayer. Every Latter-day Saint home should be a house of God, where the\naltar of prayer is ever in use and where the proper example is set to our children in\nsupplicating God for divine guidance in all of our endeavors. For the Lord has again said to\nus:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord . . .\n<\/p><p>\nAnd a commandment I give unto them&mdash;that he that observeth not his prayers before the Lord\nin the season thereof, let him be had in remembrance before the judge of my people\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12660\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12660)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12660)\">D&amp;C 68:28,33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPRAYER IN THE HOME\n<\/p><p>\nOnly a short time ago I was in a home in which an aged grandmother said to me: \"I am most\nunhappy. In this home we have nothing but the spirit of disunity. We do not seem to be able\nto agree upon anything. There is a negative spirit here, and I can tell you why we have that\nspirit. We have it because we cannot get together and pray and ask the Lord for his direction\nin solving our problems.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOn the other hand, I have a remembrance of a home where the children were taught to pray.\nThat little mother taught them how they should pray&mdash;giving them the proper concept of God.\nShe told them the story of the appearance of God, the Father, and his Son to Joseph Smith.\nThat gave the children the proper concept of God. They knew that they were praying to a\nGod with body, parts, and passions. He was real to them. He was a God of love; he was a\nGod who could hear and answer prayers. In later years this little mother became very ill. Her\nchildren stood outside of the house beside her bedroom window, and they heard her screams.\nFinally, one said to the other: \"Let us pray for Mother.\" They couldn't go into the house\nbecause the house was filled with older people who were trying to help, and the only place\nleft was the coal shed. These two youngsters, one eleven and the other thirteen, went into the\ncoal shed, and kneeling down among the lumps of coal, supplicated God to the end that their\nmother would be restored. And before night came on, that little mother was restored. She was\nhealed. What does all of this mean? It means that because of the fact that a mother had taught\nher children to pray, in the hour of her extremity, with full faith in God, her children called\nupon him to bless their mother and preserve her, and God heard that prayer, and it was\nanswered.\n<\/p><p>\nPRAYER A PRIVILEGE\n<\/p><p>\nWe should teach our children that prayer is a privilege and not a duty. We should teach them\nto pray from their hearts and not from their lips and not to pray by rote. We should teach\nthem to utter prayers of gratitude to God for all the blessings that we enjoy&mdash;prayers of\ngenerosity, not thinking so much about the things we want or need, but praying for those who\nare in distress. Prayers need not be long; they should be rather short and to the point and well\nthought out.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we will establish houses of prayer, there is no question that they will become houses of\nfaith; houses of glory; houses of God; because his holy Spirit will come and abide in such\nhomes in rich abundance. And in these homes we will find the spirit of unity, the spirit of\ncooperation, the spirit of sympathy, the spirit of kindness, and the spirit of love.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren and sisters, in these dark hours, I am sure if we supplicate God as James indicated\ncenturies ago, in full faith, we can be instrumental in preserving all of the rights and\nprivileges given to us in this great government of ours. We can further the cause of the\nMaster. We can teach the gospel of peace, and help Almighty God to consummate his plans\nbefore the coming of the King of kings.\n<\/p><p>\nI pray we will follow the advice of the Lord given to us again through the Prophet Joseph,\nwherein he said:\n<\/p><p>\nPray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, that you may conquer Satan, and that\nyou may escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold his work\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12595\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12595)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12595)\">D&amp;C 10:5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless us that we will be prayerful. May God bless us that we will establish houses\nof prayer, houses of glory, houses of faith, and houses of God, I humbly ask in the name of\nJesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
