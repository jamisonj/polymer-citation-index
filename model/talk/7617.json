At sunset my mother used to place logs in the fireplace in order to keep our dining room warm, and one by one, my parents, sisters, and I would gather together, once our daily chores were done. That cozy room\u2014created by the warmth of the fireplace, combined with the presence of each one of the members of the family\u2014instilled feelings within me that I shall treasure forever.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/returning-home.p6\" class=\"\">After my wife and I formed our own family, wherever we were living, we all also gathered often, whether around a fireplace or simply around the warmth we always feel whenever we are reunited with our children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/returning-home.p7\" class=\"\">What a beautiful feeling!

It includes over 1,700 names of members who have come home. They are members of different wards, branches, stakes, and districts from all over the country of Peru who were invited by stake presidents, bishops, and leaders of quorums and auxiliary organizations to return home. They accepted the invitation made by priesthood leaders, full-time missionaries, and others who took upon themselves the responsibility to help them return to Church and come unto Christ.
