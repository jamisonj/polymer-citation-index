Crash courses are not nearly so effective as the day-to-day reading and application of the scriptures in our lives. Become acquainted with the lessons the scriptures teach. Learn the background and setting of the Master\u2019s parables and the prophets\u2019 admonitions.

Some years ago Sister Ogando met with the missionaries and was taught the gospel. Gradually, she and the missionaries lost contact. Time passed. Then, in 2007, the principles of the gospel she had been taught by the missionaries stirred within her heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/be-your-best-self.p28\" class=\"\">One day while getting into a taxi, Daisy saw the missionaries at a distance, but she was unable to make contact with them before they disappeared from view. She prayed fervently to our Heavenly Father and promised Him that if He would somehow direct the missionaries to her once again, she would open her door to them. She returned home that day with faith in her heart that God would hear and answer her prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/be-your-best-self.p29\" class=\"\">In the meantime, two young missionaries who had been sincerely praying and working to find people to teach were one day examining the tracting records of missionaries who had previously served in their area.

May I illustrate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/be-your-best-self.p34\" class=\"\">Some 900 miles (1,400 km) north of Salt Lake City is the beautiful city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, home of the famous Calgary Stampede, one of Canada\u2019s largest annual events and the world\u2019s largest outdoor rodeo. The 10-day event features a rodeo competition, exhibits, agricultural competitions, and chuck wagon races. The Stampede Parade, which occurs on opening day, is one of the festival\u2019s oldest and largest traditions. The parade follows a nearly three-mile (5-km) route in downtown Calgary, with attendance reaching 350,000 spectators, many dressed in western attire.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/be-your-best-self.p35\" class=\"\">Several years ago, a marching band from a large high school in Utah had auditioned for and had received one of the coveted entries to march in the Calgary Stampede Parade. Months of fund-raising, early-morning practices up and down the streets, and other preparations were undertaken in order for the band to travel to Calgary and participate in the parade, where one band would be selected to receive the first-place honor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/be-your-best-self.p36\" class=\"\">Finally the day for departure arrived, with the eager students and their leaders boarding the buses and heading north for the long journey to Calgary.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/be-your-best-self.p37\" class=\"\">While en route, the caravan stopped in Cardston, Alberta, Canada, where the group remained for an overnight stay. The local Relief Society sisters there prepared sack lunches for the band members to enjoy before departing again. Brad, one of the band members, who was a priest in the Aaronic Priesthood, was not hungry and decided to keep his lunch until later.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/be-your-best-self.p38\" class=\"\">Brad liked to sit in the back of the bus. As he took his usual seat there in preparation for the remainder of the journey to Calgary, he tossed his sack lunch on the shelf behind the last row of seats. There the lunch sat by the rear window as the July afternoon sun shone through. Unfortunately, the sack lunch contained an egg salad sandwich. For those of you who don\u2019t understand the significance of this, may I just say that egg salad must be refrigerated. If it is not, and if it is subjected to high heat such as that which would be produced by the sun beating through a bus window on a sunny day, it becomes a rather efficient incubator for various strains of bacteria that can result in what may commonly be referred to as food poisoning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/be-your-best-self.p39\" class=\"\">Sometime before arriving in Calgary, Brad grew hungry. Remembering the sack lunch, he gulped down the egg salad sandwich. As the buses arrived in Calgary and drove around the city, the members of the band grew excited\u2014all except for Brad. Unfortunately, all that grew within him were severe stomach pains and other discomforts associated with food poisoning. You know what they are.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/be-your-best-self.p40\" class=\"\">Upon arriving at their destination, the band members exited the bus. Brad, however, did not. Although he knew his fellow band members were counting on him to play his drum in the parade the following morning, Brad was doubled over in pain and was too sick to leave the bus. Providentially for him, two of his friends, Steve and Mike, who had recently graduated from high school and who had also recently been ordained to the office of elder in the Melchizedek Priesthood, found that Brad was missing and decided to look for him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/be-your-best-self.p41\" class=\"\">Finding Brad in the rear of the bus and learning what the problem was, Steve and Mike felt helpless. Finally it occurred to them that they were elders and held the power of the Melchizedek Priesthood to bless the sick. Despite their total lack of experience in giving a priesthood blessing, these two new elders had faith in the power they held. They laid their hands on Brad\u2019s head and, invoking the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood, in the name of Jesus Christ uttered the simple words to bless Brad to be made well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/be-your-best-self.p42\" class=\"\">From that moment, Brad\u2019s symptoms were completely gone. The next morning he took his place with the rest of the band members and proudly marched down the streets of Calgary. The band received first-place honors and the coveted blue ribbon. Far more important, however, was that two young, inexperienced but worthy priesthood holders had answered the call to represent the Lord in serving their fellow man. When it was necessary for them to exercise their priesthood in behalf of one who was desperately in need of their help, they were able to respond because they lived their lives righteously.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/be-your-best-self.p43\" class=\"\">Brethren, are we prepared for our journey through life?
