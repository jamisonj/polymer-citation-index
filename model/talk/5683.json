Sometimes He clearly directs; other times it seems He merely permits some things to happen. Therefore, we will not always understand the role of God\u2019s hand, but we know enough of his heart and mind to be submissive. Thus when we are perplexed and stressed, explanatory help is not always immediately forthcoming, but compensatory help will be. Thus our process of cognition gives way to our personal submission, as we experience those moments when we learn to \u201cbe still, and know that I am God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42087\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42087)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42087)\">Ps. 46:10<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/swallowed-up-in-the-will-of-the-father.p29\" class=\"\">Then, the more one\u2019s will is thus \u201cswallowed up,\u201d the more his afflictions, rather than necessarily being removed, will be \u201cswallowed up in the joy of Christ\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10133\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10133)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10133)\">Alma 31:38<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/11\/swallowed-up-in-the-will-of-the-father.p30\" class=\"\">Seventy years ago, Lord Moulton coined a perceptive phrase, \u201cobedience to the unenforceable,\u201d describing \u201cthe obedience of a man to that which he cannot be forced to obey\u201d (\u201cLaw And Manners,\u201d<span class=\"emphasis\"> Atlantic Monthly,<\/span> July 1924, p. 1).

However, when you and I finally submit ourselves, by letting our individual wills be swallowed up in God\u2019s will, then we are really giving something to Him!
