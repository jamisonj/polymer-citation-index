As you know, since we were together in April, we have been saddened by the loss of three of our beloved Apostles: President Boyd\u00a0K. Packer, Elder\u00a0L. Tom Perry, and Elder Richard\u00a0G. Scott. They have returned to their heavenly home. We miss them. How grateful we are for their examples of Christlike love and for the inspired teachings they have left to all of us.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p5\" class=\"\" id=\"p5\">We extend a heartfelt welcome to our newest Apostles, Elder Ronald\u00a0A. Rasband, Elder Gary\u00a0E. Stevenson, and Elder Dale\u00a0G. Renlund. These are men dedicated to the work of the Lord. They are well qualified to fill the important positions to which they have been called.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p6\" class=\"\" id=\"p6\">Recently, as I have been reading and pondering the scriptures, two passages in particular have stayed with me. Both are familiar to us. The first is from the Sermon on the Mount: \u201cLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-12461_000_033\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131242\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131242)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131242)\">Matthew 5:16<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> The second scripture is one which came to my mind as I pondered the meaning of the first. It is from the Apostle Paul\u2019s Epistle to Timothy: \u201cBe thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-12461_000_033\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131243\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131243)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131243)\">1\u00a0Timothy 4:12<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p7\" class=\"\" id=\"p7\">I believe the second scripture explains, in great part, how we can accomplish the first. We become examples of the believers by living the gospel of Jesus Christ in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, and in purity. As we do so, our lights will shine for others to see.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p8\" class=\"\" id=\"p8\">Each of us came to earth having been given the Light of Christ. As we follow the example of the Savior and live as He lived and as He taught, that light will burn within us and will light the way for others.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p9\" class=\"\" id=\"p9\">The Apostle Paul lists six attributes of a believer, attributes that will allow our lights to shine. Let us look at each one.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">I mention the first two attributes together\u2014being an example in word and in conversation. The words we use can lift and inspire, or they can harm and demean. In the world today there is a profusion of profanity with which we seem to be surrounded at nearly every turn. It is difficult to avoid hearing the names of Deity being used casually and thoughtlessly. Coarse comments seem to have become a staple of television, movies, books, and music. Bandied about are slanderous remarks and angry rhetoric. Let us speak to others with love and respect, ever keeping our language clean and avoiding words or comments that would wound or offend. May we follow the example of the Savior, who spoke with tolerance and kindness throughout His ministry.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p11\" class=\"\" id=\"p11\">The next attribute mentioned by Paul is charity, which has been defined as \u201cthe pure love of Christ.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-12461_000_033\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131244\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131244)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131244)\">Moroni 7:47<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> I am confident there are within our sphere of influence those who are lonely, those who are ill, and those who feel discouraged. Ours is the opportunity to help them and to lift their spirits. The Savior brought hope to the hopeless and strength to the weak. He healed the sick; He caused the lame to walk, the blind to see, the deaf to hear. He even raised the dead to life. Throughout His ministry He reached out in charity to any in need. As we emulate His example, we will bless lives, including our own.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p12\" class=\"\" id=\"p12\">Next, we are to be an example in spirit. To me that means we strive to have in our lives kindness, gratitude, forgiveness, and goodwill. These qualities will provide for us a spirit which will touch the lives of those around us. It has been my opportunity through the years to associate with countless individuals who possess such a spirit. We experience a special feeling when we are with them, a feeling that makes us want to associate with them and to follow their example. They radiate the Light of Christ and help us feel His love for us.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p13\" class=\"\" id=\"p13\">To illustrate that the light which comes from a pure and loving spirit is recognized by others, I share with you an experience of many years ago.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p14\" class=\"\" id=\"p14\">At that time, leaders of the Church met with officials in Jerusalem to work out a lease agreement for land on which the Church\u2019s Jerusalem Center would be built. In order to obtain the permissions needed, the Church had to agree that no proselyting would be undertaken by our members who would occupy the center. After that agreement had been made, one of the Israeli officials, who was well acquainted with the Church and its members, remarked that he knew the Church would honor the no-proselyting agreement. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, referring to the students who would attend there, \u201cwhat are we going to do about the light that is in their eyes?\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-12461_000_033\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See James\u00a0E. Faust, \u201cThe Light in Their Eyes,\u201d<span class=\"emphasis\"> Ensign<\/span> or <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Nov. 2005, 20.]<\/span><\/sup> May that special light ever shine within us, that it might be recognized and appreciated by others.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p15\" class=\"\" id=\"p15\">To be an example of faith means that we trust in the Lord and in His word. It means that we possess and that we nourish the beliefs that will guide our thoughts and our actions. Our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in our Heavenly Father will influence all that we do. Amidst the confusion of our age, the conflicts of conscience, and the turmoil of daily living, an abiding faith becomes an anchor to our lives. Remember that faith and doubt cannot exist in the same mind at the same time, for one will dispel the other. I reiterate what we have been told repeatedly\u2014that in order to gain and to keep the faith we need, it is essential that we read and study and ponder the scriptures. Communication with our Heavenly Father through prayer is vital. We cannot afford to neglect these things, for the adversary and his hosts are relentlessly seeking for a chink in our armor, a lapse in our faithfulness. Said the Lord, \u201cSearch diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-12461_000_033\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131245\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131245)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131245)\">Doctrine and Covenants 90:24<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">Finally, we are to be pure, which means that we are clean in body, mind, and spirit. We know that our body is a temple, to be treated with reverence and respect. Our minds should be filled with uplifting and ennobling thoughts and kept free from those things which will pollute. In order to have the Holy Ghost as our constant companion, we must be worthy. Brothers and sisters, purity will bring us peace of mind and will qualify us to receive the Savior\u2019s promises. Said He, \u201cBlessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-12461_000_033\">6<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131246\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131246)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131246)\">Matthew 5:8<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p17\" class=\"\" id=\"p17\">As we prove to be examples in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, and in purity, we will qualify to be lights to the world.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">May I say to all of you, and particularly to you young people, that as the world moves further and further away from the principles and guidelines given to us by a loving Heavenly Father, we will stand out from the crowd because we are different. We will stand out because we dress modestly. We will be different because we do not use profanity and because we do not partake of substances which are harmful to our bodies. We will be different because we avoid off-color humor and degrading remarks. We will be different as we decide not to fill our minds with media choices that are base and demeaning and that will remove the Spirit from our homes and our lives. We will certainly stand out as we make choices regarding morality\u2014choices which adhere to gospel principles and standards. Those things which make us different from most of the world also provide us with that light and that spirit which will shine in an increasingly dark world.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">It is often difficult to be different and to stand alone in a crowd. It is natural to fear what others might think or say. Comforting are the words of the psalm: \u201cThe Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-12461_000_033\">7<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"131247\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 131247)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(131247)\">Psalm 27:1<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> As we make Christ the center of our lives, our fears will be replaced by the courage of our convictions.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">Life is perfect for none of us, and at times the challenges and difficulties we face may become overwhelming, causing our light to dim. However, with help from our Heavenly Father, coupled with support from others, we can regain that light which will illuminate our own path once again and provide the light others may need.<\/p>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">To illustrate, I share with you the touching words of a favorite poem I first read many years ago:<\/p>\n\t\t<div class=\"poetry\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\">I met a stranger in the night<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\">Whose lamp had ceased to shine.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\">I paused and let him light<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\">His lamp from mine.<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\">A tempest sprang up later on<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\">And shook the world about.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\">And when the wind was gone<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\">My lamp was out!<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\">But back to me the stranger came\u2014<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\">His lamp was glowing fine!<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\">He held the precious flame<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\">And lighted mine!<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-12461_000_033\">8<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[Lon Woodrum, \u201cLamps,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">The Lighted Pathway,<\/span> Oct. 1940, 17.]<\/span><\/sup><\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/sunday-morning-session\/be-an-example-and-a-light.p34\" class=\"\" id=\"p34\">My brothers and sisters, our opportunities to shine surround us each day, in whatever circumstance we find ourselves.
