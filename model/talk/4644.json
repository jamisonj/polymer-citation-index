It was a few years ago. They then lived in a beautiful home in Scarsdale, New York. He was a widely recognized and honored chemist, with a doctorate in chemical engineering. He worked for one of the big multinational companies headquartered in New York. He was credited with putting together the chemical ingredients of a product now sold around the world, the name of which is known to millions of people and the profit from which has run into many millions of dollars for his company.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-healing-power-of-christ.p10\" class=\"\">He was well paid and highly respected.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-healing-power-of-christ.p11\" class=\"\">He was also the president of the Yorktown stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He had under his direction a corps of church workers who served faithfully in their local wards, many of whom commuted each day to and from New York City, where they held high and responsible positions in some of the great corporations of America. He was their church leader.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-healing-power-of-christ.p12\" class=\"\">Now he was retired. He and his wife had sold their beautiful home, had given their children what furniture they wanted, and donated the rest to others. They had disposed of their cars and everything except their clothing, their family photographs, and their family history records. They had made themselves available to the Lord and His Church to go wherever they might be sent at their own expense. They were now in the Philippines Bacolod Mission, working among the wonderful, friendly, brown-skinned people of the area. Unemployment is high in this region, and there is much of misery. But wherever Elder and Sister Jex go, they touch for good the lives of those among whom they serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-healing-power-of-christ.p13\" class=\"\">They are there to heal the suffering people, to teach the gospel of Christ, to give encouragement and strength and hope and faith. They are there to heal wounds of misunderstanding and contention. They are there to bless the sick and to help those with diseased bodies and frustrated minds. Their smile is infectious, their laugh a joy to hear. They are living humbly among the poor, down at the level of the people, but standing straight and tall to lift with strong hands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-healing-power-of-christ.p14\" class=\"\">This former New York executive and his charming companion are in the service of the Savior, giving their full time, their resources, and their love to bless with healing the lives of many who are discouraged and need help.

They are two of a band of remarkable and dedicated older missionary couples who minister to the wants of people with numerous problems. They receive no financial compensation. They pay their own way. This world\u2019s goods mean little to them. As I said, they sold all they had when they left to come to the Philippines. They will stay for as long as they are assigned by the Church to do so. Then they want to go on another mission. They are healers among the people, serving in the cause of the Master Healer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-healing-power-of-christ.p16\" class=\"\">I have since reflected much on the power of Christ to heal and bless.

It came through the laying on of hands by Peter, James, and John, who received it from the Lord Himself. It was bestowed upon Joseph Smith, the prophet of this dispensation. Its presence is among us. Many of you acquainted with the history of the Church are familiar with the account related by Wilford Woodruff concerning the events of July 22, 1839. It is worthy of repetition. Nauvoo at that time was an unhealthy and swampy place. There was much of sickness. Joseph was among those who were afflicted. But being filled with the Spirit, he rose from his bed and went out among the sick, healing them and raising them. He then crossed the river to the settlement in Montrose, Iowa. I read now from the account of Elder Woodruff:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/the-healing-power-of-christ.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cThe first house he visited was that occupied by Elder Brigham Young, the president of the quorum of the twelve, who lay sick. Joseph healed him, then he arose and accompanied the Prophet on his visit to others who were in the same condition. They visited Elder W. Woodruff, also Elders Orson Pratt and John Taylor, all of whom were living in Montrose. They also accompanied him. The next place they visited was the home of Elijah Fordham, who was supposed to be about breathing his last. When the company entered the room the Prophet of God walked up to the dying man, and took hold of his right hand and spoke to him; but Brother Fordham was unable to speak, his eyes were set in his head like glass, and he seemed entirely unconscious of all around him. Joseph held his hand and looked into his eyes in silence for a length of time. A change in the countenance of Brother Fordham was soon perceptible to all present. His sight returned, and upon Joseph asking him if he knew him, he, in a low whisper, answered, \u2018Yes.\u2019 Joseph asked him if he had faith to be healed. He answered, \u2018I fear it is too late; if you had come sooner I think I would have been healed.\u2019 The Prophet said, \u2018Do you believe in Jesus Christ?\u2019 He answered in a feeble voice, \u2018I do.\u2019 Joseph then stood erect, still holding his hand in silence several moments; then he spoke in a very loud voice, saying: \u2018Brother Fordham, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to arise from this bed and be made whole.\u2019 His voice was like the voice of God, and not of man. It seemed as though the house shook to its very foundations. Brother Fordham arose from his bed and was immediately made whole. His feet were bound in poultices, which he kicked off, then putting on his clothes, he ate a bowl of bread and milk, and followed the Prophet into the street.\u201d (As quoted in Joseph Fielding Smith, <span class=\"emphasis\">Essentials in Church History,<\/span> rev. ed.

I venture to say that there is scarcely a faithful elder within the sound of my voice who could not recount instances in which this healing power has been made manifest in behalf of the sick.
