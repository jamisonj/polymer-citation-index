It is true that they are not adopted into the lives of some people, but the commandments that were given by Jehovah on Mount Sinai are light, are truth, eternal truth, and failure to observe them brings the opposite of joy and happiness. The same may be said of all truth given us by the Lord. Wickedness never was happiness and never will be.

We have been told that we must have respect for law and order, yet the people of this nation and other nations have arrived at a condition where crime is increasing at a rapid rate. \u201cThe whole world lieth in sin, and groaneth under darkness and under the bondage of sin.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16516\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16516)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16516)\">D&amp;C 84:49<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-road-to-happiness.p23\" class=\"\">We are fast approaching the time\u2014and perhaps have reached it when our lives are in danger from hoodlums, gangsters, and other evil-minded persons, when lawlessness is so commonplace that our properties, our holdings, our rights and privileges, are in jeopardy. When we destroy the principles of honesty, integrity, and morality, our civilization is most certainly on the verge of losing the power to preserve itself. According to the history of the past, other nations reached great eminence and power, but because of the wickedness of their people, they lost the glory that they formerly had.

Latter-day Saints look upon the family as the greatest institution of civilization. Subversion of this great institution can do nothing less than bring destruction upon the world.

And one of the things that the Lord has commanded us to do is to multiply and replenish the earth, that we might have joy in our posterity, not only in this life but throughout all eternity. When Eve was given to Adam as a wife and helpmate, there was no death. It was an eternal union, and it must needs be that the family relationship continue throughout eternity if we are to have eternal joy. The eternity of the marriage covenant can be made possible in the temples of the Lord by those having proper authority from the Lord to perform that holy ordinance.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/05\/the-road-to-happiness.p30\" class=\"\">This is a glorious world in which we live.

All these things bid us have joy. Man, however, is the greatest of all God\u2019s creations.

We cannot accomplish the immortality of our souls; that has been brought to pass by the atonement of our Redeemer and Savior. Immortality is to live forever, but immortality does not necessarily include eternal life. Eternal life does include immortality. Eternal life is to live with God in his celestial kingdom, in his presence. That is a very important part of our mission, but we can have eternal life only through the exercise of our free agency and through obedience to the gospel plan. This is the principal purpose of our coming here, that we might overcome, that we might keep the commandments the Lord has given us, and that we might render service in his kingdom. Only by doing these things will it be made possible for God to accomplish his work\u2014the purpose for which the world was created and the purpose of our existence upon this earth.
