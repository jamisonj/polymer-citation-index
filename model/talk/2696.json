Yes. And if you didn\u2019t know it, I think there is still time to repent before the next conference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/my-gratitude.p4\" class=\"\">My dear brothers and sisters, if I am here today, I owe it to hundreds of hands which pushed me, pulled me, helped me, sustained me to be here today; in fact, to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/my-gratitude.p5\" class=\"\">And what I want to share today with you is simply a message of gratitude: First to thank my wife, my dear wife, for what she has done for me, for the faith that she had in me and her constant effort to be a loving mother to two boys.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/my-gratitude.p6\" class=\"\">To my mother, now deceased, but who had the courage to lead the family to the Church, to see that the children of the family were taught in the principles of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/my-gratitude.p7\" class=\"\">To my father, still not a member, but for what he taught me\u2014to always select quality in life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/my-gratitude.p8\" class=\"\">To the missionaries, the missionaries who came knocking on my door to bring me the message of the restoration of the gospel, to those who taught me, who baptized me, to those with whom I had the great pleasure to work in the France-Switzerland Mission, missionaries whom I respect for their dedication, their sacrifice, and their example.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/my-gratitude.p9\" class=\"\">Thank you to you great people of America, for you, your fathers, and your grandfathers who gave your lives to give freedom to my country two times in forty years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/my-gratitude.p10\" class=\"\">Thank you to the leaders of the Church, to the managers who have helped me to be a constant practicer of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Thank you also to the prophet of the Lord, President Kimball, whom I love and admire because he\u2019s here to lead us, to guide us in very difficult times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/my-gratitude.p11\" class=\"\">Thank you to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for his sacrifice.
