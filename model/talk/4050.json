We exchanged pleasantries and discussed the doctrinal subjects on which we could find benign agreement. Suddenly he interrupted our conversation by stating, \u201cYou teach one belief with which I could never agree. It is your idea that \u2018as God is, man may become.\u2019\u201d (See <span class=\"emphasis\">History of the Church,<\/span> 6:302\u201317.) He held a well-worn white Bible in his hand. I asked him to turn to Matthew 5:48 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36987\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36987)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36987)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>].

While I visited the distant city where she lived, she asked if we could talk for a few minutes, and I agreed. She had heard many of the misconceptions that our detractors have used to discredit the Church for decades. We read from the scriptures for about an hour together. With relief reflected in her eyes, she finally said, \u201cI have been misled, haven\u2019t I?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/learning-our-fathers-will.p7\" class=\"\">I said, \u201cYes, you have.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/learning-our-fathers-will.p8\" class=\"\">She was disappointed with what those erring enemies of the Church were teaching, but was excited to find herself back thinking clearly again.

He looked at me momentarily and said, \u201cWell, perhaps that might be a little of it, but I believe the real reason that so many are wandering on strange paths is because they do not follow prophetic counsel to study the scriptures and attend the classes in Church.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/learning-our-fathers-will.p10\" class=\"\">I have thought of that conversation many times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/learning-our-fathers-will.p11\" class=\"\">Would a person languish in self-pity and guilt if he understood the teachings of Jesus: \u201cIn my Father\u2019s house are many mansions. \u2026 I go to prepare a place for you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"29223\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29223)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29223)\">John 14:2<\/a><\/span>.)

There are three simple steps:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/learning-our-fathers-will.p23\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">First,<\/span> attend our Church meetings. Several years ago we were given a meeting schedule that consolidated formal worship into a three-hour time frame. To each is given the identical commodity of 168 hours each week. The knave is given the same amount of time as the knight. The scriptural scholar is given the same amount of time as the doctrinal dumbo. Yes, for three hours each week we are asked to attend our formal Church meetings to become familiar with the word of God. This is less than two percent of our time. Yet too often presidencies hold meetings, members visit in the hallways, and leaders interview during this precious period. Yes, our leaders would lead better, our counselors would counsel better, and our members, by worshiping more studiously, would be able to cope more enduringly and satisfactorily.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/learning-our-fathers-will.p24\" class=\"\">What better lesson can a bishop, a Relief Society or Young Women president, a Melchizedek Priesthood quorum leader, or stake president teach than by being in a Gospel Doctrine class with his or her mate studying the word of God? Children certainly become more committed to doctrinal learning when they see their parents with scriptures in hand going to Church meetings and studying God\u2019s word together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/learning-our-fathers-will.p25\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Second,<\/span> study the scriptures with our family, with other members, and with friends, but also search the words of God in private contemplation. Search the scriptures as they relate to our priesthood, Relief Society, Sunday School, Young Women, and Primary lessons. Study the scriptures for additional enlightenment on how to be more happy and less frustrated in what only too often is at least temporarily a sad and dreary world. Every four years we are guided carefully through all of the scriptures in the adult curriculum of the Church. In a lifetime, each member can become a spiritual scriptorian instead of remaining a scriptural simpleton. How blessed we are to have our four books of scripture in editions that include efficient indexes, chapter headings, and other study helps such as the Topical Guide.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/learning-our-fathers-will.p26\" class=\"\">Last April I was deeply impressed with the words of Elder J. Thomas Fyans when he reported to the First Quorum of the Seventy the method he and his wife, Helen, use to study the scriptures. Because his stake conference assignments kept them from sitting together in the Gospel Doctrine class, learning from the Book of Mormon this year, they studied the Sunday School manual together at home, carefully marking the scriptures as they went along. They completed their study of the Book of Mormon in just four months and were looking forward to repeating the experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/learning-our-fathers-will.p27\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Third,<\/span> brothers and sisters, we are to practice what we learn and teach.
