But never alone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-doorway-called-love.p71\" class=\"\">One winter day, I thought back to an experience from my boyhood. I was just eleven. Our Primary president, Melissa, was an older and loving gray-haired lady. One day at Primary, Melissa asked me to stay behind and visit with her. There the two of us sat in the otherwise-empty chapel. She placed her arm about my shoulder and began to cry.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-doorway-called-love.p72\" class=\"\">Surprised, I asked her why she was crying.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-doorway-called-love.p73\" class=\"\">She replied, \u201cI don\u2019t seem to be able to encourage the Trail Builder boys to be reverent during the opening exercises of Primary. Would you be willing to help me, Tommy?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-doorway-called-love.p74\" class=\"\">I promised Melissa that I would. Strangely to me, but not to Melissa, that ended any problem of reverence in that Primary. She had gone to the source of the problem\u2014me. The solution was love.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-doorway-called-love.p75\" class=\"\">The years flew by. Marvelous Melissa, now in her nineties, lived in a nursing facility in the northwest part of Salt Lake City. Just before Christmas I determined to visit my beloved Primary president. Over the car radio, I heard the song, \u201cHark! the herald angels sing; Glory to the newborn King!\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 209.) I reflected on the visit made by wise men those long years ago. They brought gifts of gold, of frankincense, and of myrrh. I brought only the gift of love and a desire to say thank you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-doorway-called-love.p76\" class=\"\">I found Melissa in the lunchroom. She was staring at her plate of food, teasing it with the fork she held in her aged hand. Not a bite did she eat. As I spoke to her, my words were met by a benign but blank stare. I took the fork in hand and began to feed Melissa, talking all the time I did so about her service to boys and girls as a Primary worker. There wasn\u2019t so much as a glimmer of recognition, far less a spoken word. Two other residents of the nursing home gazed at me with puzzled expressions. At last they spoke, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to her. She doesn\u2019t know anyone\u2014even her own family. She hasn\u2019t said a word in all the years she\u2019s been here.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-doorway-called-love.p77\" class=\"\">Luncheon ended. My one-sided conversation wound down. I stood to leave. I held her frail hand in mine, gazed into her wrinkled but beautiful countenance, and said, \u201cGod bless you, Melissa. Merry Christmas.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-doorway-called-love.p78\" class=\"\">Without warning, she spoke the words, \u201cI know you. You\u2019re Tommy Monson, my Primary boy. How I love you.\u201d She pressed my hand to her lips and bestowed on it the kiss of love. Tears coursed down her cheeks and bathed our clasped hands. Those hands, that day, were hallowed by heaven and graced by God. The herald angels did sing. The words of the Master seemed to have a personal meaning never before fully felt: \u201cWoman, behold thy son!\u201d And to his disciple, \u201cBehold thy mother!\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"29341\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29341)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29341)\">John 19:26\u201327<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-doorway-called-love.p79\" class=\"\">Outside the sky was blue\u2014azure blue.
