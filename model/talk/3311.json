I remember our many non\u2013English-speaking sisters and yearn for the time when we can all join together under these circumstances.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p5\" class=\"\">May such a time as this fill your hearts, lift your spirits, give you hope. May it help you sort your thinking and fortify you so you will always find yourself on the Lord\u2019s side in a world bent upon pulling women in another direction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p6\" class=\"\">For some time now there has been an enormous fuss made about women, some of it made by women in honor of themselves. Now I\u2019m not sure that girls are any safer on the streets or women any happier in their lives or any of us more effective in our service\u2014or even better-looking\u2014because of all this furor, but it has been an interesting season.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p7\" class=\"\">Though this is the day of women, I pay tribute to the men who lead us, who bless us, who pray over us and with us, and who would gladly raise their voices more frequently in our defense, if only we would let them raise their voices!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p8\" class=\"\">It is exciting to be an active participant as a woman in all that is being done for us by the Brethren. Latter-day Saint women are not only protected, they are privileged; and life is full of incredible and unique promise for us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p9\" class=\"\">Brethren, thank you. We love you. We marvel at all you are and all you do. We honor the priesthood of God which you bear and appreciate the errand you are on.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p10\" class=\"\">We women want to help, not hinder.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p11\" class=\"\">It is about being a help, sisters, and prepared helpers, that I would speak to you now.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p12\" class=\"\">Paul wrote to the Thessalonians something that expresses my feelings for all of you wherever and whoever you are:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cBut we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cSo being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2758\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2758)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2758)\">1 Thes. 2:7\u20138<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p15\" class=\"\">What we say tonight, then, we say in all gentleness but not without strong feeling. The Women in this Church need to be prepared\u2014personally prepared\u2014first, to stem the tide of error inundating the world, threatening families, short-circuiting the power of individuals. Second, though we have great men to lead us, we need to know for ourselves what is error and what is truth so that we can make valid value judgments. So much depends on this. Third, we need to grow and develop so that we are prepared to contribute. We each have a mighty errand to do. It may or may not include marriage and motherhood at this time, but ours is the errand of influence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p16\" class=\"\">Remember, sisters, a woman doesn\u2019t have to stay in the house to be in the home. Neither does a woman need to leave her home to extend her influence to others. We will, however, be more effective on our errand if we have studied the gospel, developed our skills, and reached up and beyond our own first associations. The sooner we start, the sooner we\u2019ll soar. Growth is gradual. Time is so swift\u2014crickets call, then Christmas comes. One day a little girl\u2014next day a woman. \u201cSunrise, sunset,\u201d the nostalgic song reminds us. And so it is. Tonight you\u2019re twelve and then suddenly you\u2019re in a holding pattern just past forty. There is no time for delay in personal improvement. Proper preparation for life doesn\u2019t happen overnight.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p17\" class=\"\">Recently I stood with Sister Camilla Kimball while President Kimball greeted the little children at an area conference. A young mother-to-be rushed toward us and threw her arms around Sister Kimball, hugged her, and wept. Then as she gained her composure she said, \u201cOh Sister Kimball, you are so beautiful, so serene, and so supportive to your husband.\u201d Fresh tears accompanied this outburst and then she said, \u201cOh, Sister Kimball, my husband says this is how I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p18\" class=\"\">Sister Kimball, who is all that the woman said and more, spoke quietly to her, \u201cIt will come. We all have to learn through experience.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p19\" class=\"\">The young mother-to-be went away comforted. The beginning wasn\u2019t the end! She lifted her head in hope, as I believe we all must do, to move steadily forward in ultimate faith that the end can be better than the beginning, wherever we may start.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p20\" class=\"\">I don\u2019t deny the struggle\u2014it is the essence of Eden; but personal progress is what this life is all about. We must begin at once to work our plan of life, deciding to whom and to what we will give our fullest attention, our highest loyalty, our deepest commitment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p21\" class=\"\">And which leaders we will follow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p22\" class=\"\">I plead for a stir among the sisters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for intelligent and prayerful preparation and performance that is in line with what our Heavenly Father wants for us personally and what he needs for us to do as women. He lives! He loves us. He knows our needs and aches. He cares. He will help us. Keep close to the Lord. He has established this Church and called a prophet to lead us. Keep close to the prophet. President Kimball, as you listen, know that we love you and pray for you. We miss you\u2014but your special helper is a blessing to us all.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p23\" class=\"\">President Kimball spoke at general conference in April about people and plateaus and the critical need for each of us to grow, to get off constricting ground and move forward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p24\" class=\"\">Was anybody listening?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p25\" class=\"\">Individually, are we moving forward as is our rapidly growing church?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p26\" class=\"\">Or would we have drowned in Noah\u2019s day or been caught polishing the golden calf with Aaron\u2019s people?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p27\" class=\"\">Our lack of individual progress can impede the Savior\u2019s work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p28\" class=\"\">I don\u2019t want to seem simplistic, sisters, but we need to move!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/11\/our-mighty-errand.p29\" class=\"\">Like our brethren, we too have a mighty errand of our own.
