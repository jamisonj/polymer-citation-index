I do hope and pray that the\nLord will bless me with his Spirit, that I may be able to give you something that will be for\nyour good and the up-building of the kingdom of God.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"He that loveth me\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFor a theme I thought I would take the words of our Savior: \"He that hath my\ncommandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me shall be\nloved of my Father\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28353\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28353)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28353)\">John 14:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI am going to read to you a few words from Paul the apostle, written to the Corinthian Saints.\nNow, the people out in the world have a strange idea about these epistles of Paul and of the\nmen who have written the epistles we have in the Bible. They apply them unto themselves,\nand they look upon them as being declared as messages to all the world. But this is not so.\nDefinitely, each of these epistles was written to members of the Church &mdash;not to\ndenominations, but to those who heard the words of the apostles of old, had received them,\nand had been baptized and confirmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ in that\ndispensation.\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, we should have the understanding when we read these epistles that the things said\nby the apostles are not things that apply to those who have not made covenants through the\ngospel of Jesus Christ and did not in that day. I am going to read a most definite, emphatic\nstatement to members of the Church, some of whom had been drifting a little in that day, just\nas we do today, some of whom were not fully converted, and some of whom had forgotten\nthe messages that the brethren taught to them and that they received when they came into the\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Evidence of the covenant-maker<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSo Paul instructed these members of the Church and called attention to certain conditions\nwhich are peculiar to those who have made covenants with Jesus Christ. And Paul is not\nspeaking to our generation. He is speaking of the generation in which he lived. And so to\nthese Corinthian members of the Church he said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stone, wood, hay, stubble; \n<\/p><p>\n\"Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be\nrevealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.\n<\/p><p>\n\"If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.\n<\/p><p>\n\"If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so\nas by fire.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"460\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 460)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(460)\">1 Cor. 3:12-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThus he wrote to the Saints in Corinth, and these words apply equally to the Saints of this\npresent day. Paul could not say that to those who had not been baptized and confirmed, for\nthe Lord has said definitely that those who are not members of the Church cannot receive the\nHoly Ghost; and so Paul said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy, for the temple of God is holy,\nwhich temple ye are.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let\nhim become a fool, that he may be wise.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in\ntheir own craftiness\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"462\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 462)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(462)\">1 Cor. 3:17-19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo we should take notice of this. We cannot build on any other foundation. I think that there\nare members of the Church who have pride, who have placed gold, silver, precious things as\ntheir great goal. And they have neglected their duties and responsibilities, which their\nmembership in the Church requires of them.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, let me read another passage to these same members of the Church, many of whom had\nsadly departed from the true teachings that they had received from Paul and others who had\nbeen sent to teach them: \n<\/p><p>\n\"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which\nye have of God, and ye are not your own?\n<\/p><p>\n\"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which\nare God's\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"464\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 464)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(464)\">1 Cor. 6:19-20<\/a><\/span>). That statement of Paul's is just as true and applies with equal\nforce in the cases of Latter-day Saints today.\n<\/p><p>\nPaul could not say that to those who had not made covenants. He could have told anybody\nanywhere that he was bought with a price, but he could not tell them that the Holy Ghost had\nbeen given to them, because it was not given except to members of the Church. But the fact\nremains that every soul upon the face of the earth was bought with a price &mdash;Jew and Gentile,\nthe heathen, the atheist. No matter where a man lives or what he believes or the circumstances\nunder which he lives, he was bought and paid for with a price, a price that was paid by our\nLord and Savior Jesus Christ, and he was the only one who could pay it. No one else was\never born into this world who could pay this price.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>His \"rights\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnd from what were we bought? Before I answer that question, I want to say something else.\nI have heard people say, and members of the Church too, \"I have a right to do as I please.\"\nMy answer is: No, you do not. You haven't any right at all to do just as you please. There is\nonly one right that you have, and that is to do just what I read to you: keep the\ncommandments of Jesus Christ. He has a perfect right to tell us so. We have no right to\nrefuse. I do not care who the man is; I do not care where he lives, or what he is &mdash;when the\ngospel of Jesus Christ is presented to him, he has no right to refuse to receive it. He has the\nprivilege. He is not compelled to receive it, because our Father in heaven has\ngiven to everyone of us, in the Church and out, the gift of free agency. That free agency gives\nus the privilege to accept and be loyal to our Lord's commandments, but it has never given us\nthe right to reject them. Every man who rejects the commandments of our Father in heaven is\nrebellious.\n<\/p><p>\nOf course, I realize that there are thousands of people who have never heard the gospel. They\nare not going to be punished for that. We cannot expect a person to observe a commandment\nhe has never heard. But all those who have never had the privilege of hearing it will at some\ntime have that privilege. If it is not in this life, it will be in the spirit world. And every soul\nwill have the opportunity to accept the mission of our Savior Jesus Christ or to reject it.\nWhen the Lord commands us, if we love him we will keep the commandments. This is the\nlaw to members of the Church, in the words of the Savior: \"He that hath my commandments,\nand keepeth them, he it is that loveth me\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28354\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28354)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28354)\">John 14:21<\/a><\/span>). Again, the Savior said: \"If ye\nlove me, keep my commandments\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28351\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28351)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28351)\">John 14:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nUnfortunately we have members of the Church who set aside the commandments the Lord has\ngiven us, who fail to observe them strictly. This is not your right. It is just your privilege, the\nprivilege the Lord has given you to act for yourself. You are agents with the power within\nyou to obey or to disobey. If it were not so, no one could be tried for disobedience. We read in\nthe scriptures that every man will be tried according to his works\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42417\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42417)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42417)\">Rev. 20:12-13<\/a><\/span>). Well, if we are not under\nobligation, who can try us? Did you ever think of that? If there were no obligation for me to\nkeep the commandments of the Lord, if I broke them, I could not be punished.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Benefits of obedience<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe do not punish men for doing something that is not contrary to the laws do we? But the\nLord has given us his laws, the gospel of Jesus Christ, not because it is pleasing to him, not\nbecause he is going to get anything out of it. He has given us these laws that we might get\nsomething out of them. And, of course, every person who keeps these commandments adds\nthat much to his personal glory. There is no question about that, because when we sustain our\nSavior and are true and faithful to him, he is the benefactor. But are we not benefited, and are\nnot the benefits greater to us by far than they are to him? Our Lord never gave a\ncommandment in this world to any man that was not intended to be to his eternal benefit. I\nthink sometimes we overlook that.\n<\/p><p>\nI hope the Lord will help me to keep his commandments. As I said, his commandments are\nnot hard to keep (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1088\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1088)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1088)\">1 Jn. 5:3<\/a><\/span>).\nHe said that himself (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35721\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35721)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35721)\">Matt. 11:30<\/a><\/span>). Some people say that his commandments are hard to\nkeep. This is an admission, isn't it, that they are not keeping them?\n<\/p><p>\nLet me ask you a question: Is there anybody here who has not committed some sin or\ntransgression of divine law? If so, you may please raise your hand. I don't see any hands up.\nI can't raise mine. Well, did you ever, after you had committed some wrong, feel sorry and\nget the spirit of repentance and wish you had not done it? If you have not felt that way, you\nhad better see your bishop. I have done things I should not have done, and I have felt sorry. I\nnever committed murder; I have kept my body clean; I have not been stealing from people.\nWhen I was a child, I may have taken something that did not belong to me, like the\nneighbor's apples. But when I have done some wrong, I have been troubled.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>He carried the burden<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior never committed any sin nor carried any troubled conscience. He was not under\nthe necessity of repenting as you and I are; but in some way that I cannot understand, he\ncarried the weight of my transgressions and yours and the transgressions of every soul who\ncomes into this Church from the days of Adam to our present time and to the end of time. He\ncame and offered himself as a sacrifice to pay the debt for each of us who is willing to repent\nof his sins and return to him and keep his commandments. Think of it, if\nyou can. The Savior carried that burden in some way beyond our comprehension. I know that,\nbecause I accept his word. He tells us of the torment he went through the torment was so\ngreat that he pled with his Father that if it were possible he might not drink the bitter cup and\nshrink: \". . . nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31721\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31721)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31721)\">Luke 22:42<\/a><\/span>). The answer he got\nfrom his Father was, \"You have to drink it.\"\n<\/p><p>\nCan I help loving him? No, I cannot. Do you love him? Then keep his commandments. If you\ndo not, you will have to answer for them yourselves.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Death, and then redemption<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhen Adam and Eve were placed in the Garden of Eden, they did not have to die. They\ncould have been there to this day. They could have continued on for countless ages. There\nwas no death then. But it would have been a terrific calamity if they had refrained from\ntaking the fruit of that tree, for they would have stayed in the Garden of Eden and we would\nnot be here &mdash;nobody would be here except Adam and Eve. So Adam and Eve partook.\nEating of that forbidden fruit subdued the power of the spirit and created blood in their\nbodies. No blood was in their bodies before the Fall. The blood became the life of the body.\nAnd the blood was not only the life thereof, but it had in it the seeds of death. And so we\ngrow old and we die. But it would have been a dreadful thing if Adam and his posterity had\nbeen forced, because of the Fall, to die and remain dead; that would have been the case had\nthere been no redemption.\n<\/p><p>\nThat is what Satan wanted, so he worked on them. I think he had this idea: \"Now, I have\ndestroyed the Lord's plan. I have caused Adam and Eve to become mortal and they are going\nto die; everyone will have to die, and they will become subject to me.\" And he laughed about it.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Through Jesus Christ, our Lord\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere was only one way of redemption, one way in which reparation could be made and the\nbody restored again to the spirit; that was by an infinite atonement, and it had to be made by\nan infinite being, someone not subject to death and yet someone who had the power to die\nand who also had power over death. And so, our Father in heaven sent us his Son, Jesus\nChrist, into the world with life in himself. And because he had a mother who had blood in\nher veins, he had the power to die. He could yield up his body to death and then take it again.\nLet me read his own words: \"Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,\nthat I might take it again.\n<\/p><p>\n\"No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I\nhave power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28339\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28339)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28339)\">John 10:17-18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHe had power to lay down his life, and on the cross he paid the price for our sins and at the\nsame time for Adam's transgression. His infinite atonement resulted in two things: (1)\nrestoration of the body to the spirit, and (2) the redemption of those who accept the gospel of\nJesus Christ and who will be loyal in the keeping of his commandments &mdash;freedom from their\nsins.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, in conclusion, what are we going to do? Are we going to love him? Are we going to\nrealize the great work he did for us and are we going to be grateful, or are we going to\nviolate his commandments? I would like to read something by Sydney Harris, taken from the\n<i>Deseret News<\/i> in 1964, entitled \"Would We Believe and Follow?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"If there should be a second coming, would there not be soon a second crucifixion? And this\ntime, not by the Romans or the Jews, but by those who proudly call themselves Christians? I\n<i>wonder!<\/i> I wonder how we today would regard and treat this man with his strange and\nfrightening and 'impractical' doctrines of human behavior and relationships. Would we\nbelieve and follow, any more than the masses of people in his day believed and followed?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Would not the militarists among us assail him as a cowardly pacifist\nbecause he urges us not to resist evil?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Would not the nationalists among us attack him as a dangerous internationalist because he\ntells us we are all of one flesh?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Would not the wealthy among us castigate him as a trouble-making radical because he bars\nthe rich from entering the kingdom of heaven?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Would not the liberals among us dismiss him as a dreamy vagabond because he advises us to\ntake no thought for the morrow, to lay up no treasures on earth?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Would not the ecclesiastics among us denounce him as a ranting heretic because he cuts\nthrough the core of ritual and commands us only to love God and our neighbors?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Would not the sentimentalist among us deride him as a cynic because he warns us that the\nway to salvation is narrow and difficult?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Would not the puritans among us despise and reject him because he eats and drinks with the\npublicans and sinners, preferring the company of winebibbers and harlots to that of\n'respectable' church members?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Would not the sensual among us scorn him because he fasts for forty days in the desert,\nneglecting the needs of the body?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Would not the proud and important among us laugh at him when he instructs the twelve\ndisciples that he who would be 'first' should be the one to take the role of the least and serve\nall?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Would not the worldly wise and educated among us be aghast to hear that we cannot be\nsaved except we become as children, and that a little child shall lead us?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Would not each of us &mdash;in his own way &mdash;find some part of this man's saying and doing to\nbe so threatening to our ways of life, so much at odds with our rooted beliefs, that we could\nnot tolerate him for long?\n<\/p><p>\n\"I wonder, I wonder if we are any more prepared for the second coming than we would have\nbeen for the first.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we go to our homes let us get on our knees and thank the Lord for his many blessings,\nand our Lord Jesus Christ for his mercy and his greatness and goodness for making it possible\nfor us, through the keeping of his commandments, to go back into the presence of God our\nFather and dwell with him.
