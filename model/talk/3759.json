At a ward gathering they thought they shouldn\u2019t call on him because he would speak too long. Their final decision was, however, that they couldn\u2019t pass him by, so they called on him and asked him to stand and tell them in just a word how they could live to be as old as he was and still be of service. So he got up and said, \u201cKeep breathing.\u201d I won\u2019t be that brief, but I will attempt to be to the point.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p5\" class=\"\">I love the simple truths contained in the welfare principles as taught by all the holy prophets since the world began, and I never tire of speaking about them. Today I shall speak to you about the principle of self-reliance and its impact upon our spiritual development.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p6\" class=\"\">Since the beginning of time man has been counseled to earn his own way, thereby becoming self-reliant. It is easy to understand the reason why the Lord places so much emphasis on this principle when we come to understand that it is tied very closely to freedom itself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p7\" class=\"\">On this subject, Elder Albert E. Bowen said, \u201cThe Lord must want and intend that His people shall be free of constraint whether enforceable or only arising out of the bindings of conscience. \u2026 That is why the Church is not satisfied with any system which leaves able people permanently dependent, and insists, on the contrary, that the true function and office of giving, is to help people [get] into a position where they can help themselves and thus be free.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Church Welfare Plan,<\/span> Gospel Doctrine manual, 1946, p. 77.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p8\" class=\"\">Many programs have been set up by well-meaning individuals to aid those who are in need.

Fishing is still good, but the gulls don\u2019t know how to fish. For generations they have depended on the shrimp fleet to toss them scraps from the nets. Now the fleet has moved. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cThe shrimpers had created a Welfare State for the \u2026 sea gulls.

Elections often turn on what the candidates promise to do for voters from government funds. This practice, if universally accepted and implemented in any society, will make slaves of its citizens.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p16\" class=\"\">We cannot afford to become wards of the government, even if we have a legal right to do so.

However, the principle is the same in all countries: We should strive to become self-reliant and not depend on others for our existence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p18\" class=\"\">Governments are not the only guilty parties. We fear many parents in the Church are making \u201cgullible gulls\u201d out of their children with their permissiveness and their doling out of family resources. Parents who place their children on the dole are just as guilty as a government which places its citizens on the dole. In fact, the actions of parents in this area can be more devastating than any government program.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p19\" class=\"\">Bishops and other priesthood leaders can be guilty of making \u201cgullible gulls\u201d out of their ward members. Some members become financially or emotionally dependent on their bishops. A dole is a dole whatever its source. All of our Church and family actions should be directed toward making our children and members self-reliant. We can\u2019t always control government programs, but we can control our own homes and congregations. If we will teach these principles and live them, we can do much to counter the negative effects which may exist in government programs in any country.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p20\" class=\"\">We know there are some who for no reason of their own cannot become self-reliant. President Henry D. Moyle had these people in mind when he said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cThis great principle does not deny to the needy nor to the poor the assistance they should have. The wholly incapacitated, the aged, the sickly are cared for with all tenderness, but every able-bodied person is enjoined to do his utmost for himself to avoid dependence, if his own efforts can make such a course possible; to look upon adversity as temporary; to combine his faith in his own ability with honest toil; to rehabilitate himself and his family to a position of independence; in every case to minimize the need for help and to supplement any help given with his own best efforts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cWe believe [that] seldom [do circumstances arise in which] men of rigorous faith, genuine courage, and unfaltering determination, with the love of independence burning in their hearts, and pride in their own accomplishments, cannot surmount the obstacles that lie in their paths.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cWe know that through humble, prayerful, industrious, God-fearing lives, a faith can be developed within us by the strength of which we can call down the blessings of a kind and merciful Heavenly Father and literally see our handicaps vanish and our independence and freedom established and maintained.\u201d (In Conference Report, Apr. 1948, p. 5.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p24\" class=\"\">Self-reliance is not the end, but a means to an end. It is very possible for a person to be completely independent and lack every other desirable attribute. One may become wealthy and never have to ask anyone for anything, but unless there is some spiritual goal attached to this independence, it can canker his soul.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p25\" class=\"\">The welfare program is spiritual. In 1936, when the program was introduced, President David O. McKay made this astute observation:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cThe development of our spiritual nature should concern us most. Spirituality is the highest acquisition of the soul, the divine in man; \u2018the supreme, crowning gift that makes him king of all created things.\u2019 It is the consciousness of victory over self and of communion with the infinite. It is spirituality alone which really gives one the best in life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cIt is something to supply clothing to the scantily clad, to furnish ample food to those whose table is thinly spread, to give activity to those who are fighting desperately the despair that comes from enforced idleness, but after all is said and done, the greatest blessings that will accrue from the Church [welfare program] are spiritual. Outwardly, every act seems to be directed toward the physical: re-making of dresses and suits of clothes, canning fruits and vegetables, storing foodstuffs, choosing of fertile fields for settlement\u2014all seem strictly temporal, but permeating all these acts, inspiring and sanctifying them, is the element of spirituality.\u201d (In Conference Report, Oct. 1936, p. 103.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p28\" class=\"\">In the Doctrine and Covenants we read:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cWherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p30\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for my commandments are spiritual.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17763\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17763)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17763)\">D&amp;C 29:34\u201335<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p31\" class=\"\">This scripture tells us there is no such thing as a temporal commandment. It also tells us that man is to be \u201can agent unto himself.\u201d Man cannot be an agent unto himself if he is not self-reliant. Herein we see that independence and self-reliance are critical keys to our spiritual growth. Whenever we get into a situation which threatens our self-reliance, we will find our freedom threatened as well. If we increase our dependence, we will find an immediate decrease in our freedom to act.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p32\" class=\"\">Thus far, we should have learned that self-reliance is a prerequisite to the complete freedom to act. We have also learned, however, that there is nothing spiritual in self-reliance unless we make the right choices with that freedom. What then should we do once we have become self-reliant in order to grow spiritually?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p33\" class=\"\">The key to making self-reliance spiritual is in using the freedom to comply with God\u2019s commandments.

By so doing we experience the only true and lasting happiness. Service is not something we endure on this earth so we can earn the right to live in the celestial kingdom. Service is the very fiber of which an exalted life in the celestial kingdom is made.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p48\" class=\"\">Knowing that service is what gives our Father in Heaven fulfillment, and knowing that we want to be where He is and as He is, why must we be commanded to serve one another? Oh, for the glorious day when these things all come naturally because of the purity of our hearts. In that day there will be no need for a commandment because we will have experienced for ourselves that we are truly happy only when we are engaged in unselfish service. Let us use the freedom which comes from self-reliance in giving and serving.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p49\" class=\"\">Can we see how critical self-reliance becomes when looked upon as the prerequisite to service, when we also know service is what Godhood is all about? Without self-reliance one cannot exercise these innate desires to serve. How can we give if there is nothing there? Food for the hungry cannot come from empty shelves. Money to assist the needy cannot come from an empty purse. Support and understanding cannot come from the emotionally starved. Teaching cannot come from the unlearned. And most important of all, spiritual guidance cannot come from the spiritually weak.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p50\" class=\"\">There is an interdependence between those who have and those who have not. The process of giving exalts the poor and humbles the rich. In the process, both are sanctified. The poor, released from the bondage and limitations of poverty, are enabled as free men to rise to their full potential, both temporally and spiritually. The rich, by imparting of their surplus, participate in the eternal principle of giving. Once a person has been made whole or self-reliant, he reaches out to aid others, and the cycle repeats itself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p51\" class=\"\">We are all self-reliant in some areas and dependent in others. Therefore, each of us should strive to help others in areas where we have strengths. At the same time, pride should not prevent us from graciously accepting the helping hand of another when we have a real need. To do so denies another person the opportunity to participate in a sanctifying experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/the-celestial-nature-of-self-reliance.p52\" class=\"\">Again, I say the principle of self-reliance is spiritual, as are all the principles of the welfare program. This is not a doomsday program, but a program for today. One of the three areas of emphasis recently outlined in the statement on the mission of the Church is to perfect the Saints, and this is the purpose of the welfare program. Today is the time for us to perfect our lives. May we continue to hold fast to these truths, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
