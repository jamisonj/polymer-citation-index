That divine help, however, is predicated upon our worthiness.

That city is 100 miles from the ocean. Getting there involves a difficult, often turbulent passage over the bar guarding the Columbia River and a long trip up the Columbia and Willamette Rivers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-eternal-voyage.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cBut ship captains like to tie up at Portland. They know that as their ships travel the seas, a curious saltwater shellfish called a barnacle fastens itself to the hull and stays there for the rest of its life, surrounding itself with a rocklike shell. As more and more [of these] barnacles attach themselves, they increase the ship\u2019s drag, slow its progress, decrease its efficiency.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-eternal-voyage.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cPeriodically, the ship must go into dry dock, where with great effort the barnacles are chiseled or scraped off.

Barnacles can\u2019t live in fresh water. There, in the sweet, fresh waters of the Willamette or Columbia, the barnacles die and some fall away, while those that remain are easily removed. Thus, the ship returns to its task lightened and renewed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-eternal-voyage.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cSins are like those barnacles.

In fact, I still do. I had a fielder\u2019s glove inscribed with the name <span class=\"emphasis\">Mel Ott.<\/span> He was the premier player of my day. My friends and I would play ball in a small alleyway behind the houses where we lived. Our playing field was cramped, but all right, provided you hit straightaway to center field. However, if you hit the ball to the right of center, disaster was at the door. Here lived Mrs. Shinas, who, from her kitchen window, would watch us play; and as soon as the ball rolled to her porch, her large dog would retrieve the ball and present it to her as she opened the door. Into her house Mrs. Shinas would return and add the ball to the many she had previously confiscated. She was our nemesis, the destroyer of our fun\u2014even the bane of our existence. None of us had a good word for Mrs. Shinas, but we had plenty of bad words for her. None of us would speak to her, and she never spoke to us. She was hampered by a stiff leg which impaired her walking and must have caused her great pain. She and her husband had no children, lived secluded lives, and rarely came out of their house.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-eternal-voyage.p26\" class=\"\">This private war continued for some time\u2014perhaps two years\u2014and then an inspired thaw melted the ice of winter and brought a springtime of good feelings to the stalemate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-eternal-voyage.p27\" class=\"\">One evening as I performed my daily task of watering our front lawn, holding the nozzle of the hose in the hand as was the style at that time, I noticed that Mrs. Shinas\u2019s lawn was dry and beginning to turn brown. I honestly don\u2019t know, brethren, what came over me, but I took a few more minutes and, with our hose, watered her lawn. I continued to do this throughout the summer, and then when autumn came I hosed her lawn free of leaves as I did ours and stacked the leaves in piles at the street\u2019s edge to be gathered. During the entire summer I had not seen Mrs. Shinas. We boys had long since given up playing ball in the alleyway. We had run out of baseballs and had no money to buy more.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/your-eternal-voyage.p28\" class=\"\">Early one evening, Mrs. Shinas\u2019s front door opened, and she beckoned for me to jump the small fence and come to her front porch. This I did. As I approached her, she invited me into her living room, where I was asked to sit in a comfortable chair. She treated me to cookies and milk. Then she went to the kitchen and returned with a large box filled with baseballs and softballs, representing several seasons of her confiscation efforts. The filled box was presented to me. The treasure, however, was not to be found in the gift but rather in her words. I saw for the first time a smile come across the face of Mrs. Shinas, and she said, \u201cTommy, I want you to have these baseballs, and I want to thank you for being kind to me.\u201d I expressed my own gratitude to her and walked from her home a better boy than when I entered.

Let us recognize and respond to the needs of the widow; the cry of the child; the plight of the unemployed; the burden of the sick, the confined, the aged, the poor, the hungry, the lame, and the forgotten. They are remembered by our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. May you and I follow Their divine examples. Heavenly peace will then be our blessing, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-20905_000_022\"><a name=\"-20905_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-20905_000_022\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cCome, All Ye Sons of God,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 322, text by Thomas Davenport.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-20905_000_022\"><a name=\"-20905_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-20905_000_022\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Quoted in Hugh Nibley, <span class=\"emphasis\">Abraham in Egypt<\/span> (1981), 192.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-20905_000_022\"><a name=\"-20905_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-20905_000_022\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cHarbor of Forgiveness,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Church News,<\/span> 30 Jan. 1988, 16.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-20905_000_022\"><a name=\"-20905_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-20905_000_022\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"33582\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33582)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33582)\">Matt. 28:19\u201320<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-20905_000_022\"><a name=\"-20905_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote5-20905_000_022\">5.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"32931\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32931)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32931)\">Mark 16:20<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-20905_000_022\"><a name=\"-20905_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote6-20905_000_022\">6.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"10923\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10923)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10923)\">D&amp;C 64:29<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-20905_000_022\"><a name=\"-20905_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote7-20905_000_022\">7.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"10943\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10943)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10943)\">D&amp;C 84:88<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-20905_000_022\"><a name=\"-20905_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote8-20905_000_022\">8.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"26904\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26904)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26904)\">John 4:13\u201314<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-20905_000_022\"><a name=\"-20905_000_022\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote9-20905_000_022\">9.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"22115\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22115)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22115)\">Ether 12:27<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
