I look at Ruby sitting over here, bless her heart; this year we will celebrate our 69th wedding anniversary. And so on this day, my heart is filled with gratitude for the blessings that I have received and for the influence that the Church has had upon me and my life, with Ruby by my side, and for the sons that we have raised, Bruce and Robert, and our daughter, Karen, and their families. I can also see in my mind\u2019s eye at this time, not only here in Utah but in California and in Texas and in North Carolina and in Boston, great-grandchildren in front of the television. And they\u2019re probably saying, \u201cThat old guy up there is Grandpa. He\u2019s kind of looking old, isn\u2019t he?

And I told her that I would take a 7-Up or some lemon drink.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/love-and-service.p8\" class=\"\">As she brought it to me and handed me the drink, she noticed my tie pin. And on my tie pin, which I have here in my hand\u2014we were using these in the Scottish Mission years ago\u2014there was the crest of the royal family of England. But in the center of that crest we had emblazed the London Temple. And so on this tie pin was the temple with that crest around it. As the stewardess handed me the 7-Up, she said, \u201cMy, that\u2019s an unusual tie pin. What is on it?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/love-and-service.p9\" class=\"\">And I said, \u201cThat\u2019s a temple.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/love-and-service.p10\" class=\"\">And this young lady said, \u201cA temple?

It was evidently very early in the morning, and He called out and asked them if they were having any success. They said no, and He told them to cast the nets on the other side. And then in that account which is so beautifully recorded by John, they drew the nets in and there were lots of fish.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/love-and-service.p25\" class=\"\">The Savior was there. There was a fire, according to John\u2019s account, and they ate fish and honeycomb or bread.

He asked if I could arrange to come down sometime, and he\u2019d arrange for a fireside. He wanted me to talk to the \u201csnowbirds.\u201d He pointed out that hundreds of people, \u201csnowbirds,\u201d fly into Arizona in the wintertime, coming from various parts of the United States to settle down there during the winter months. And he said, \u201cThey\u2019re retired now, wonderful people, well qualified. They come, and are now in the wards.\u201d If you\u2019re a snowbird, you know, you can spend part of the time in Arizona and part of the time somewhere else, and so you\u2019re sort of free to do what you\u2019d like to do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/love-and-service.p32\" class=\"\">Let me just remind all of you of the great need we have out in the world as the missionary program moves forward for couple missionaries to help strengthen the branches and the stakes throughout the world as we bring more people into the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/love-and-service.p33\" class=\"\">You all have probably heard much about the story of what happened in Mongolia when Ken Beesley was there and helped the government in establishing an institution of higher learning, teaching them about curriculum and administration, and in so doing he started opening the door for the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/love-and-service.p34\" class=\"\">You have also probably heard of President Gary Cox and his wife, Sister Joyce Cox, who were called to go there as missionaries and then as mission president and of the wonderful service that they rendered.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/love-and-service.p35\" class=\"\">And then came Dr. John Bennett and his wife, Carolyn, who had served in Mongolia and who told of when they thought they were going to be called to the Canary Islands, because someone there had invited them to come, but when their mission call came it was to Mongolia. They were astonished. I read some of their comments later on, of what had happened to them in Mongolia, all of the lives that they touched and the service that they rendered. And even though back home they\u2019d had a brother die and they\u2019d had children be married and have receptions, they said, \u201cWe were able to keep in touch with them by telephone while this was all going on.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/love-and-service.p36\" class=\"\">Think of what has happened in Mongolia now, where we have some 1,300 members and nine branches.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1999\/05\/love-and-service.p37\" class=\"\">I think also of Brother Ken Woolstenhulme and his wife, Sister Karren Woolstenhulme, from up in Oakley, Utah, who wanted to go out somewhere where the action was, and they were sent to Perth, Australia.

After being home long enough to kiss the grandchildren hello and good-bye, they were then called to serve in Hawaii, where he was director of the visitors\u2019 center.
