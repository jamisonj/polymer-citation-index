During the march from Ohio to Missouri known as Zion\u2019s Camp, Joseph and Hyrum were seriously ill with cholera, and their lives were almost taken. At one point, \u201cHyrum sprang to his feet and exclaimed, \u2018Joseph, we shall return to our families. I have had an open vision, in which I saw mother kneeling under an apple tree; and she is even now asking God, in tears, to spare our lives. \u2026 The Spirit testifies, that her prayers \u2026 will be answered.\u2019\u201d (Lucy Mack Smith, <span class=\"emphasis\">History,<\/span> p. 229.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/the-family-of-the-prophet-joseph-smith.p24\" class=\"\">In the exercise of agency, and in the divine providence of God, Lucy\u2019s sons, Joseph and Hyrum, ultimately sealed their testimonies with their blood. As the grieving mother looked upon their lifeless remains, she cried, \u201cMy God, my God, why hast thou forsaken this family!\u201d As a kind blessing to a faithful mother, the Lord softened her grief and granted to her the peace that only God can bestow.
