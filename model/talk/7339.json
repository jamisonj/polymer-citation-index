It is tender and sweet. It has always a certain sacredness about it. When we talk about testimony, we refer to feelings of our heart and mind rather than an accumulation of logical, sterile facts. It is a gift of the Spirit, a witness from the Holy Ghost that certain concepts are true.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/the-power-of-a-personal-testimony.p18\" class=\"\">A testimony is the sure knowledge or assurance from the Holy Ghost of the truth and divinity of the Lord\u2019s work in these latter days.
