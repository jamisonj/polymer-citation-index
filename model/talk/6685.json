Part of the light which makes you so magnificent is the blessing of womanhood. What a wonderful thing it is for you to know that your female, feminine characteristics are an endowment from God. Our latter-day prophets teach that \u201cgender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-22905_000_040\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[The Family: A Proclamation to the World, <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Oct. 1995, 102.]<\/span><\/sup> It is a holy blessing to be born with the exquisite qualities of a daughter of God. Women of God, both old and young, are spiritual and sensitive, tender and gentle. They have a kind, nurturing nature. This is your inheritance. Never belittle the gifts God has given to you.

It\u2019s about holding that torch high.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hold-high-the-torch.p9\" class=\"\">The world will try to make you think that being good is outdated and old-fashioned and that popularity comes from breaking the rules and lowering your standards. Don\u2019t buy into that way of thinking. As you watch TV or read magazines, you might be made to feel abnormal when, really, you are the one who has it figured out.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hold-high-the-torch.p10\" class=\"\">You may know that I am the mother of seven sons. I know boys! It has been an exciting life at our house! I\u2019ve learned a lot from them and from their friends, both boys and girls, and I could tell you a few of their secrets. Maybe I could just share one and hope that I won\u2019t get in trouble. This is it: boys hate to be embarrassed. I remember the time a young man I know had a date for the prom. He brought her to our house before the dance so we could take pictures. When they got there he came into the kitchen, where I was looking for the camera, and said: \u201cWait until you see my date\u2019s dress. She looks so beautiful!\u201d This boy had never said anything like that before so I could hardly wait to see what he meant.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hold-high-the-torch.p11\" class=\"\">When I saw her I understood; she was lovely. The dress she was wearing was beautiful; I learned that she and her mother had searched everywhere for it. When they finally found this dress, they knew it would be perfect with some added fabric and finishing touches to meet their high standards.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hold-high-the-torch.p12\" class=\"\">All their efforts were rewarded because she was absolutely radiant this night, but it was more than the dress that made her shine. It was her quiet confidence. As I looked at her, I was reminded of the scripture, \u201cLet virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-22905_000_040\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11424\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11424)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11424)\">D&amp;C 121:45<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Where did this confidence that she had come from? I noticed that this young woman could focus on others because she was not worried about how she looked. She had taken care of that detail weeks before. The young man she was with felt comfortable and safe and happy when he was with her because her dress was not revealing. It was modest in every way, and this made her confident and happy. And that\u2019s appealing. He wasn\u2019t embarrassed by her; he was proud of her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hold-high-the-torch.p13\" class=\"\">The kind of young woman who can be a terrific torchbearer has high standards all the time, not just in her prom dress, but every, ordinary day. There are so many of you who are like that, and I salute you tonight. You have made modesty your way of life. It is more than how you dress. It includes at least six things that I can think of: (1) your behavior is decent and modest, and yet you are very fun to be with; (2) your language is never crude but happy and interesting; (3) you are well groomed, and that is appealing; (4) you are focused on developing your talents and achieving your goals, not piercing and tattooing and flaunting your body; (5) you play sports with gusto but never lose control; (6) you don\u2019t seem to care about what the latest pop star wears or does because you have a certain style of your own. In summary, you do not imitate the world\u2019s standards because you know a higher standard. You know who you are, and that puts you at a real advantage. You know that you really are a daughter of Heavenly Father. You know that He <span class=\"emphasis\">knows <\/span>you and that He <span class=\"emphasis\">loves<\/span> you; you want to please Him and honor His love for you. You know that even if you make foolish mistakes, He will help you if you turn to Him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hold-high-the-torch.p14\" class=\"\">You act like you have memorized <span class=\"emphasis\">For the Strength of Youth!<\/span> Isn\u2019t that a great little guide? Sometimes I like to call it \u201chelps for happiness\u201d because living these standards can be your secret weapon for attracting good people to you and keeping you on the right track. When you live the high standards of the Church every day, you hold high the torch.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hold-high-the-torch.p15\" class=\"\">A girl I will call Liz is an example of what I am talking about. She was a student in a math class with a girl I will call Lindsay, who noticed that there was just something about Liz that \u201cglowed,\u201d as she put it. Lindsay admitted that she really didn\u2019t think Liz knew her, but she still made her feel good. She really stood up for what she believed, and she always made others feel good and included. For several weeks Lindsay observed Liz. Then one day, Liz didn\u2019t show up at school. Then another and then another passed. Lindsay finally learned that Liz was very ill with life-threatening meningitis.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hold-high-the-torch.p16\" class=\"\">She came home from school and just sat at the table crying. It wasn\u2019t like she and Liz were close friends, but she said to her mom that they just had to do something to help her. Lindsay suggested that perhaps their whole family could fast and pray for Liz. What a shock it was for the mother to hear that coming from one of her own children, because fasting and prayer had not been mentioned in their home for years. When Lindsay and her mom talked with the rest of the family about it that night at supper, there was some resistance, but Lindsay pleaded with them and finally they all agreed to fast and pray for Liz, a stranger. The most wonderful thing happened. It wasn\u2019t long before Liz returned to school appearing healthy and happy as ever. But even more important than this, the experience brought the most remarkable spirit of hope into Lindsay\u2019s home. Because of it, some serious changes have taken place in their family. They are now having family prayer together, something that had not happened for years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hold-high-the-torch.p17\" class=\"\">Liz\u2019s goodness glowed, and it was catching. Liz, if you are here tonight, I would just like to say, \u201cThank you! By your goodness you have blessed at least one whole family whom you probably do not even know. And who knows how many others have been guided as you held high your torch.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hold-high-the-torch.p18\" class=\"\">Being good makes you feel good, and it also makes others feel good! Can I just tell you this\u2014it is so much easier to do what is right than it is to do what is wrong. Life is so much less complicated when you are good.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/hold-high-the-torch.p19\" class=\"\">The greatest advantage of being good is that it will lead you to the temple, the most beautiful and sacred of all the places on this earth.
