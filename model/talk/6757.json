The Ramoutars live in a village that is a \u201cdrug-infested\u201d place where many parents and adults are addicted to alcohol or are trafficking in drugs.

Sometimes doctors, policemen, teachers, or our own missionaries share useful lessons such as President Gordon B. Hinckley\u2019s six B\u2019s.
