With tear-filled eyes, she told me, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I believe anymore.\u201d She spoke of having struggled and prayed many days to know how to make a vitally important decision in her life, without success. She anguished, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. If you\u2019ll tell me what to do, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d With her hand on the scriptures, she said, \u201cGod told us He would help us.

My prayer is to help you who have similar feelings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer.p5\" class=\"\">When answers to urgent prayer don\u2019t seem to come, it can be that we don\u2019t understand some truths about prayer, or because we don\u2019t recognize answers when they come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer.p6\" class=\"\">Our Heavenly Father did not put us on earth to fail but to succeed gloriously. It may seem paradoxical, but that is why recognizing answers to prayer can sometimes be very difficult. Some face life with only their own experience and capacity to help them. Others seek, through prayer, divine inspiration to <span class=\"emphasis\">know<\/span> what to do. When required, they qualify for power beyond their own capacity to do it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer.p7\" class=\"\">Communication with our Father in Heaven is not a trivial matter. It is a sacred privilege. It is based upon unchanging principles. When we receive help from our Father in Heaven, it is in response to faith, obedience, and the proper use of agency.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer.p8\" class=\"\">It is a mistake to assume that every prayer we offer will be answered immediately. Some prayers require considerable effort on our part. True, sometimes impressions come when we have not specifically sought them. They generally concern something we need to know and are not otherwise able to find out.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer.p9\" class=\"\">We are here on earth to gain experience we can obtain in no other way. We are given the opportunity to grow, to develop, and to gain spiritual maturity. To do that, we must learn to apply truth. How we face challenges and resolve difficult problems is crucially important to our happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer.p10\" class=\"\">To better understand prayer, I have listened to the counsel of others, pondered the scriptures, and studied the lives of prophets and others. Yet what seems most helpful is seeing in my mind a child approaching trustingly a loving, kind, wise, understanding Father, who wants us to succeed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer.p11\" class=\"\">Don\u2019t worry about your clumsily expressed feelings. Just talk to your Father. He hears every prayer and answers it in His way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer.p12\" class=\"\">When we explain a problem and a proposed solution, sometimes He answers yes, sometimes no. Often He withholds an answer, not for lack of concern, but because He loves us\u2014perfectly. He wants us to apply truths He has given us. For us to grow, we need to trust our ability to make correct decisions. We need to do what we <span class=\"emphasis\">feel<\/span> is right. In time, He will answer. He will not fail us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer.p13\" class=\"\">I have described the absolute reality of our relationship with our Father. There is nothing about us He does not know. He is conscious of our every need and could provide all of the answers. Yet, because His purpose is our eternal happiness, He encourages us to make the correct choices.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer.p14\" class=\"\">Sometimes, like a child, we misbehave, act unwisely, and feel we cannot approach our Father with a problem. When communication is strained, how wonderful it is to have a Mediator who works things out when we obey His counsel and repent. Such is our Elder Brother, the Savior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer.p15\" class=\"\">Perhaps Oliver Cowdery\u2019s experiences were recorded for us to understand how to pray and how to recognize answer to prayer.

Like many of us, Oliver did not recognize the evidence of answers to prayers already given by the Lord.

We are expected to assume accountability by acting on a decision that is consistent with His teachings without prior confirmation. We are not to sit passively waiting or to murmur because the Lord has not spoken. We are to act.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/learning-to-recognize-answers-to-prayer.p33\" class=\"\">Most often what we have chosen to do is right. He will confirm the correctness of our choices His way. That confirmation generally comes through packets of help found along the way. We discover them by being spiritually sensitive.

In the highlands of Guatemala, members barely subsist. Going to the temple requires <span class=\"emphasis\">great<\/span> sacrifice. A visit takes a year of preparation. There is hard work, sacrifice to save money and food, the spinning, dyeing, and weaving of new clothing. There is the long, barefoot walk out of the mountains, the crossing of Lake Isabel, the bus rides with little food. Tired and worn, they arrive at the temple.

Innocently, she knelt at the entrance to the room, oblivious to others. She bowed her head, sobbed, and for twenty minutes poured out her heart to her Father in Heaven. Finally, with her dress soaked with tears, she raised her head. The sensitive temple matron asked, \u201cMay I help?\u201d She responded, \u201cOh, would you? This is my problem: I\u2019ve tried to tell Father in Heaven of my gratitude for all of my blessings, but I don\u2019t feel that I\u2019ve communicated.
