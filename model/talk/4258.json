Over the past fifty years, inspired leaders have taught welfare principles to help us plan ahead for difficult times that may come in our lives.

With pain, dehydration, fever, and total enervation, an important welfare lesson was learned\u2014that one could suddenly be thrust into a condition of intense need. Experiences such as this help us to become more aware of the needs of others and to realize that many people throughout the world live with these problems every day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/05\/welfare-principles-to-guide-our-lives-an-eternal-plan-for-the-welfare-of-mens-souls.p5\" class=\"\">During the past few months, I have read and pondered the scriptures as well as discourses on welfare given at general conferences over the past fifty years.

Some have become confused about what \u201cwelfare\u201d really means. Some approaches to welfare in the world foster idleness, give subsidies with no labor required, create a burden of debt, and promote greediness\u2014an appetite for things of this world rather than the riches of eternity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Too often rich and poor alike shut their hearts to the divine attributes of love and compassion. The rich languish in their abundance and justify turning the poor away as \u201cwelfare cases.\u201d The poor are likewise entrapped, becoming dependent on others in a system destined to trample initiative, undermine family responsibility, foster divisiveness, and erect barriers to equity, opportunity, and fellowship.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Lord rejects such welfare programs. His plan meets the needs of all, however abundant or modest their circumstances. His purpose is to provide for our eternal welfare. \u201cThe prime duty of help to the poor [in body and spirit] \u2026 is not [solely] to bring temporal relief to their needs, but salvation to their souls.\u201d (J. Reuben Clark, Jr., address given 9 July 1941, transcript, Church Historical Department.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>We are also told that \u201cthe Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their trust in him.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24762\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24762)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24762)\">Hel. 12:1<\/a><\/span>.) However, it is the disposition of many men that when all things are done for them, they \u201charden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One\u2014yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\u201cAnd thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, \u2026 they will not remember him.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24763\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24763)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24763)\">Hel. 12:2\u20133<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>It is a sobering thought that the purpose of having opposition in all things, trials and tribulations in our lives, commands a concern for the needy in order to humble us and draw us closer to the Lord our God and nearer to perfection.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The scriptures provide the spiritual framework for the welfare plan.

It shares this position in common with other gospel activities. Temporal challenges humble us and become spiritual opportunities. Temporal challenges bring us to our knees in prayer, seeking heavenly guidance and assistance from the Lord as well as from our brothers and sisters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>As we persist in putting welfare principles to work, adding our strengths and resources to those possessed by others, we can overcome our adversities. Overcoming temporal obstacles demonstrates to us that nothing is too hard for the Lord. Our faith in Christ is confirmed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">4.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>By living welfare principles, we can develop self-reliance. The welfare program requires that we develop self-reliance and live providently. Provident living requires us to develop proper attitudes\u2014a willingness to forego luxuries, to avoid excess, and to fully use what we have\u2014learning to live within our means.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Unrestricted by programs and projects, bricks and mortar, the Lord\u2019s real storehouse is indeed in the homes and the hearts of His people. As the members of the Church follow the counsel to become self-reliant, they represent an immense pool of resources, knowledge, skills, and charity available to help one another. This storehouse, the Lord has said, is \u201cfor the poor of my people, \u2026 to advance the cause, which ye have espoused, to the salvation of man, and to the glory of your Father who is in heaven.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18460\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18460)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18460)\">D&amp;C 78:3\u20134<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">5.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The welfare plan builds love and compassion for our fellowmen. As we live the principles of welfare, love and compassion will abound in our homes, in our worship, and in our service to others. Gone will be the lamentable practices of intemperance and abuse of wives and children. Abused children become abusive parents. It is everybody\u2019s responsibility to see that this cycle of abuse is stopped. It is hypocritical to talk of compassion to others while we are rude or abusive within our own families. Let us put our own homes in order, seeing that the spiritual and emotional needs of our families are met. Then no one will escape our empathy and concern\u2014be they rich or poor; old or young; family, neighbors, or strangers within our reach.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>There are many Christian acts of charity in our community that have come to my attention. There are many guardian angels in our communities who care for the transients with a hot meal and a warm place to sleep for an evening. There are many who take custody of orphans and homeless to share their quiet love and compassion. Alma (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9542\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9542)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9542)\">Alma 34:28<\/a><\/span>) says if Saints turn away the needy, they are \u201cas hypocrites who do deny the faith.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I know of a family who once a month holds a \u201cprovident living family council.\u201d With mother and father, the children determine how $25 out of their budget\u2014in addition to their tithes and offerings\u2014will be distributed to an individual in need. Last month, $25 went to a young child in the Primary Children\u2019s Medical Center. This is one way to teach compassion to children, especially as they visit the sick child in the hospital. (By the way, the children now want to save more money to give to the needy in next month\u2019s budget.) This family does other charitable acts, too. They do not give money and feel that they have done their compassionate service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>One family made room in their small home for a neighbor family whose home was being repaired after a fire. They were giving not what was convenient for them, but rather what was <span class=\"emphasis\">needed<\/span> by the neighbor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Another family invited their eighteen-year-old son\u2019s friend who needed a home to stay with them for a year while he prepared for a mission. They provided an environment of emotional support and spiritual example and enabled him to earn his own money for his mission. On his mission he grew in maturity, self-esteem, and confidence. Since his mission, with self-reliance, he has gone forward to strengthen others.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Financial need is an important part of welfare, but there are other equally important essential elements that, through love and compassion, build self-reliance\u2014emotionally and physically\u2014helping one to be useful and productive and to be a help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">6.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The welfare plan sanctifies both the giver and the receiver. We are all both givers and receivers. President Marion G. Romney has said, \u201cThere is an interdependence between those who have and those who have not. The process of giving exalts the poor and humbles the rich. In the process, both are sanctified.\u201d (Ensign, Nov. 1982, p. 93.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>No one is exempt from giving to the impoverished. The counsel is: \u201cAnd again, I say unto the poor \u2026 I mean all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: <span class=\"emphasis\">I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give.\u201d<\/span> (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40616\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40616)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40616)\">Mosiah 4:24<\/a><\/span>; italics added.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>No one is exempt from receiving. To the rich, the reality is: \u201cFor behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, \u2026 calling on his name, and begging for a remission of [our] sins\u201d through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ? (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40615\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40615)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40615)\">Mosiah 4:19\u201320<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">7.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The welfare plan builds a Zion People. Zion is characterized in scripture as a city in which the people \u201cwere of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39672\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39672)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39672)\">Moses 7:18<\/a><\/span>.) Zion is \u201cevery man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18463\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18463)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18463)\">D&amp;C 82:19<\/a><\/span>.) This promised Zion always seems to be a little beyond our reach. We need to understand that as much virtue can be gained in progressing toward Zion as in dwelling there. It is a process as well as a destination. We approach or withdraw from Zion through the manner in which we conduct our daily dealings, how we live within our families, whether we pay an honest tithe and generous fast offering, how we seize opportunities to serve and do so diligently. Many are perfected upon the road to Zion who will never see the city in mortality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>So, my bothers and sisters, when we think of welfare, let us think of the plan revealed by our Lord for the eternal welfare of our souls. It is a plan to build faith, love, compassion, self-reliance, and unity. When adapted to local needs throughout the world by vigorous priesthood leaders, the plan sanctifies both givers and receivers and prepares a Zion people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>With these basic welfare principles in mind, today we are being asked to teach and practice the doctrine of work, self-reliance, provident living, giving, and caring for the poor; to increase our generous fastoffering donations to help those in need; to increase our compassionate service, involving the family in charitable acts of service to one another and to our neighbors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I bear you my testimony that we live in a dispensation of time when there have been ministering angels. The angel Moroni was one such heavenly messenger. His visit was essential to the restoration of the gospel through the Prophet Joseph Smith. But, Joseph Fielding Smith taught us that \u201cit is contrary to the law of God for the heavens to be opened and messengers to come to do anything for man that man can do for himself.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Doctrines of Salvation,<\/span> 3 vols., comp. Bruce R. McConkie, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1954\u201357, 1:196.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>That you and I might realize that we have the power and responsibility to help those in need, as ministering angels for the Lord Jesus Christ, that we will be loved because we love, be consoled because we are compassionate, be forgiven because we have demonstrated the capacity to forgive, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
