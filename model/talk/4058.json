Gathered there were 150 priesthood leaders and their families in that beautiful camp where the plain meets the soaring, pine-covered mountains.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/keeping-the-covenants-we-make-at-baptism.p5\" class=\"\">Jeremy Judd was there with his family, and he celebrated his eighth birthday during that week. Because Jeremy wanted to be baptized on his eighth birthday, his father, Alma, made the arrangements. That Saturday afternoon I participated in one of the most spiritual baptismal experiences of my life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/keeping-the-covenants-we-make-at-baptism.p6\" class=\"\">Baptismal clothes were borrowed from a nearby ward. We drove to a stream located about fifteen minutes from camp where the water was deep enough to perform the ordinance. It was a secluded spot in the wilderness. A bank overlooked the stream as it flowed through a clearing of stately cottonwoods. We stood in the high grass and listened carefully as first the mother and then the father spoke to their son about the ordinance that was about to be performed. They reminded Jeremy of the importance of the covenant he was about to make. They indicated that the covenant he was making was a promise, or an agreement, to obey all the laws of the gospel. They told him he should consider baptism as the entrance into a new life\u2014with the Savior as his example.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/keeping-the-covenants-we-make-at-baptism.p7\" class=\"\">Then the father took his son by the hand and walked down the bank, over the pebbles, and into the water. There he immersed his young son in the water of the clear-flowing stream after the pattern given by the Lord. The boy\u2019s sixteen-year-old sister stood by my side, and tears streamed down her cheeks as she whispered, \u201cI am so happy for Jeremy.\u201d I too was happy for Jeremy, and at that moment I remembered the joy I felt at my own baptism.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/keeping-the-covenants-we-make-at-baptism.p8\" class=\"\">After Jeremy had changed his clothes, he stood in the clearing while his father and the other brethren laid their hands upon his head and confirmed him a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/keeping-the-covenants-we-make-at-baptism.p9\" class=\"\">With the sunlight on his wet hair and a radiance on his face, Jeremy felt a reverent calm, and he confided in me with wonder and excitement, \u201cI was baptized in a river just like Jesus!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/keeping-the-covenants-we-make-at-baptism.p10\" class=\"\">The spot in the River Jordan where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist must have looked something like this beautiful place where we stood.

Lisa, age eleven, lives in England. She came home from school one day feeling very excited. She had been asked to read a part in the school devotional assembly the following morning. She said to her mother, \u201cBut some of the words are wrong.\u201d Her mother discovered that one paragraph referred to God and the Holy Ghost as being one and the same person. Lisa and her mother decided to write a letter to Lisa\u2019s teacher explaining that this paragraph was contrary to Lisa\u2019s belief, and that she would feel much happier leaving it out.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/keeping-the-covenants-we-make-at-baptism.p15\" class=\"\">The next afternoon her mother waited anxiously for Lisa to return home from school. She came home with a big, bright smile on her face. Not only had the teacher let her leave the paragraph out, but she had asked for more information about the Church. In addition, the teacher asked Lisa to present an assembly about the Church. All this came about because Lisa lived up to the covenant she had made and was willing to witness to the world her own beliefs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/keeping-the-covenants-we-make-at-baptism.p16\" class=\"\">Thinking about Alma Judd and his son Jeremy reminds me of another Alma who stepped into a fountain of pure water in the land of Mormon to perform the ordinance of baptism for other believers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1984\/11\/keeping-the-covenants-we-make-at-baptism.p17\" class=\"\">The Book of Mormon records that Alma was one who heard the teachings of Abinadi and believed.

On his own, Jonathan went to the telephone, called his mother, and asked if it would be all right to give the younger boy his hat because he needed it more.
