Bowen, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1951, pp. 120-125<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nNaturally the thoughts of the speakers at this conference have turned to President Smith, so\nrecently departed. Mine run the same way. If he were standing here today where I stand, I can\neasily conjecture him as pleading with the people to live their religion that is, to live in\npractice up to the high standards of what they have been taught.\n<\/p><p>\nJUDGED ACCORDING TO WORKS\n<\/p><p>\nI should like, if I may, to say a little about that, with particular reference to the personal\nresponsibility of each individual for what he turns out to be.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was permitted to John the Revelator to glimpse the future as the revelation of things to\ncome passed in panoramic view before his vision. Among other things, he says: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God . . . and they were judged\nevery man according to their works\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42226\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42226)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42226)\">Rev. 20:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTwo lines of thought closely related and of tremendous consequence to all of us are\nstimulated by this graphic statement. First, there is implicit in it the thesis that death is not the\nend of man. Those marshaled for rating had died, for it was the dead whom John saw.\nSecond, their classification and recompense depended upon their own deeds, what they had\ndone while they yet lived. It is this second feature of the vision to which I wish to direct\nattention.\n<\/p><p>\nAs the hosts from the dead passed before the throne, they were judged every man, according\nto his works. That is justice in the highest sense of the term. It is judgment founded in\nrighteousness. It reaches completely up to the perfect ideal. No fault can be found in it, for\nevery man is to be classified and rewarded on the basis of his own individual performance. It\nhas always been the conception of enlightened nations of free men, particularly those whose\nlaws are rooted in the Christian code, that only to that degree in which judgments have\nembraced righteousness have they approximated justice. Long ago the Prophet Amos coupled\nthe two together in their proper relationship, and no right-thinking man has ever been able, or\ntried to sever the bond which inseparably unites them.\n<\/p><p>\nAmos admonished his nation: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . let judgment roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10402\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10402)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10402)\">Amos 5:24<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMEANING OF RIGHTEOUSNESS\n<\/p><p>\nI hesitate to use the word righteousness because it has come to have attached to it the malodor\nof hypocrisy. Too commonly, one who is spoken of as possessed of the quality of\nrighteousness is derisively sneered at, as if the term characterized him as a pretender, a\nself-exalter, one who arrogates to himself superior virtues, as exemplified in the parable of\nJesus about the Pharisee who publicly thanked God that he was not as other men and loudly\nproclaimed his own virtues. Jesus said that the publican who, standing apart, alone, humbly\nprayed God to be merciful to him a sinner would be justified before the other\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31299\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31299)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31299)\">Luke 18:9-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNo sense of opprobrium properly attaches to the term righteousness. It signifies that which is\nin accordance with right, or characterized by uprighteousness or morality. There is no other\nword to take its place. I am therefore obliged to use it and trust to its being understood in its\nproper sense.\n<\/p><p>\nJohn's statement about the basis of judgment must be read as affirming that there are things\nwhich everybody is expected to do. The promise of rewards based upon works presupposes\nthat there are requirements prescribed. Where there is no law, there can be no judgment under\nthe law is a principle of divine as well as secular governance. The prescribed requirements,\nnaturally, are to be sought in the teachings of Jesus for John was his disciple. And by his\nrevelation, John tells us, he was shown the things he saw\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42220\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42220)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42220)\">Rev. 4:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOBSERVANCE OF LAW\n<\/p><p>\nOn his final visit to the disciples before his ascension, as has before been stated today, Jesus\ncommissioned them to carry his message to all people, telling those whom they proselyted to\nobserve all things whatsoever he had commanded them\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34483\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34483)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34483)\">Matt. 28:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\nHere, then, is the law on the basis of\nwhich all are to be judged. So far as I can discern, there is not one thing in all that Jesus\ntaught that would not, it practiced, promote righteousness and justice in the earth. Nobody\nwould be harmed by universal conformance to every rule governing human conduct which he\npromulgated. One cannot think that it was ever intended that man should be consigned to live\nperpetually in this earth amid the carnage and bestiality and bickering and hatred and cruelty;\nthe plundering of one by another; the deception and greed; the striving for advantage of one\nover another; the despoiling of fellow creatures; the stifling and crushing out of all sentiments\nof mercy and human kindness by the violence of brute force and by submerging righteousness\nand everything that makes life beautiful, under the vile, putrid, hideous, and ugly flocks of\nvice which swirl over the land. All this and all the groveling ugliness of human degradation\nparaded before us in the daily press are in direct antagonism to the benevolence and\nbrotherhood, the worth and dignity of the human soul with its God-given right to be free from\nthe bondage of oppression; the admonitions to love and mercy, to be pure in heart, and to\nhunger and thirst after righteousness, expounded as guides to righteousness and abundant\nliving by the Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nThe other day J. Edgar Hoover told the Senate committee investigating syndicated crime in\nAmerica that gambling could be cleansed out at once if officials in states and cities would\nhonestly enforce the law, instead of conniving with those who are willing to pay the price of\nprotection for the violation of the law. Following gambling would go the whole brood of\nloathsome evils spawned by it. If that could be done, how infinitely more could the earth be\ncleansed by a simple observance of the laws laid down as the basis for divine judgment and\njustice.\n<\/p><p>\nBE YE THEREFORE PERFECT\n<\/p><p>\nOn another occasion, even before his crucifixion, holding up to view the mission and purpose\nof life, the goal of man's striving, his ultimate destiny, the Lord said, \"Be ye therefore\nperfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34418\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34418)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34418)\">Matt. 5:48<\/a><\/span>). This terse sentence\nepitomizes all that Jesus taught about the mission of life and the destiny of man. It seems on\nits face a hard saying, and many have felt that it sets a task beyond all possibility of\naccomplishing, and that there is no use trying; that it projects an ideal so utterly unrealistic as\nto make it of little value. There might be some validity to this objection, if life is to be\nthought of only in terms of mortal probation. To get full value of the admonition we need a\nbroader understanding of the work of life.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Brigham Young let some light in on that in one of his sermons. After quoting the\nsaying, he remarked: \"If the . . . passage I have quoted is not worded to our understanding,\nwe can alter the phraseology of the sentence, and say: 'Be ye perfect as ye can,' for that is all\nwe can do.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"When we are doing as well as we know how in the sphere and station which we occupy\nhere, we are justified in the justice, righteousness, mercy, and judgment that go before the\nLord of heaven and earth (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41762\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41762)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41762)\">Ps. 89:14<\/a><\/span>).\n We are as justified as the angels who go before the throne of God.\nThe sin that will cleave to all the posterity of Adam and Eve is that they have not done as\nwell as they know how\" (Journal of Discourses, 2:129-130).\n<\/p><p>\nRIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT\n<\/p><p>\nThat puts the admonition to be perfect on a practical working basis. It is within the range of\nthe possibility of attainment. It tells us, too, something about how high a prerogative\nrendering judgment is. It requires for righteous dispensation of justice divine omniscience.\nThat is perhaps why God reserved judgment to himself. They whom John saw stood before\nGod.\n<\/p><p>\nHe would have complete knowledge of all the essential facts, which mortals rendering human\njudgments perhaps never have, and which so often results in miscarriage of justice. God\nwould have complete understanding of all the influences that have gone into the shaping of\nthe life to be judged; the knowledge possessed and the opportunity for knowing; the capacity\nfor understanding what he had been taught; the kind of association and society he has the\ncapacity to mingle congenially with, and from all the manifold factors involved, put the one\njudged where he belongs, which is what final judgment really is.\n<\/p><p>\nPROGRESSIVE BEINGS\n<\/p><p>\nThis interpretation introduces the principle that it is not intended that we shall accomplish\neverything in this life, but that we are expected to be progressive beings, growing toward our\nfinal destiny. But that principle in no way excuses us from doing the best we can, or from\nacquiring all the knowledge that we have capacity and opportunity to assimilate as we go\nalong. We have some very specific teachings about that. The scriptures say: \n<\/p><p>\nWhatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the\nresurrection.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his\ndiligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world\nto come (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12943\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12943)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12943)\">D&amp;C 130:18-19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIntelligence has been interpreted as the ability to comprehend and respond to light and truth.\nBut it is clear from what has been quoted that knowledge and intelligence are congenial\ncompanions; and moreover, that to achieve them requires industry, study, diligence, and\nobedience. Their acquisition is governed by the universal law of reward for effort. They do\nnot come as gratuitous bestowals upon the idler or the indifferent.\n<\/p><p>\nEXCELLENCE THROUGH EFFORT\n<\/p><p>\nThis is the point I wanted especially to emphasize here today, and it is the reason, perhaps,\nfor all that I have said before. There is nothing in all the history and experience of the race,\nnothing in the teachings of Jesus, nothing in the doctrines of the Church, which warrants the\nassumption that excellence may be attained without effort, either in the spiritual realm or the\ntemporal domain, or that high exaltation may be achieved by a mere profession of faith, or\npassive adherence to a creed or body of doctrines. Jesus made that abundantly clear in saying:\n<\/p><p>\nNot every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven;\nbut he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34434\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34434)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34434)\">Matt. 7:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is to be noted that the teachings of Jesus pertained mostly to this life. From time to time he\ngave us glimpses of a glorious future. But these were conditioned upon what we do here, just\nas by John's revelation the dead were judged by the works they had done while they lived\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42227\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42227)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42227)\">Rev. 20:12<\/a><\/span>).\nWe are not here just to prepare to die but rather to live, and to use all our powers to perfect\nourselves by acquiring knowledge, developing our talents, building virtue unto ourselves,\nconquering evil, by practicing the things we know. The progress we make here determines our\nstatus hereafter.\n<\/p><p>\nA PRACTICAL RELIGION\n<\/p><p>\nWe have a very practical religion. It pertains to our lives now. And the reward of observance\nof the law is not altogether postponed to a future on the other side of the grave. Building up\nthe kingdom involves some very practical things. It is not altogether concerned with the\nnon-material lying out in the ethereal realm. The building of meetinghouses, places of\nworship, schools, temples, for example, clearly is for spiritual purposes. But they involve a\nlarge element of the material. They are essential to the building up of the kingdom of God.\nAnd where would you classify the beautifying of your home; the making of refined\nsurroundings? It is necessary to provide the things that sustain life, to master the arts and\ncrafts and trades that meet the needs of progress and improvement. I do not think I can find\nthe line that divides the spiritual from the temporal.\n<\/p><p>\nNobody in this life can gain proficiency in all the realms of human knowledge or skills or\nendeavors, yet they complement each other, and each is essential to the completeness of the\nwhole. By the cooperative endeavor of all in an organized body, each doing what his talent\nsuits him for, the kingdom can be prepared. I suppose the rightness of what either one does\ndepends upon the purpose or the motive which stimulates the pursuit, whether that be the\npromoting of good among men, the furtherance of righteousness or whether it be the\ngratification of a selfish ambition, to be achieved without regard to consequences to others, or\nits influence on human progress or improvement.\n<\/p><p>\nGROWTH THROUGH ACTIVITY\n<\/p><p>\nKnowledge lying dormant and not employed to useful purposes is of very little value. One\nmay attain membership in the Church, for example, by complying with all the requisite\ninitiatory ordinances, but if he stops there, as some do, he may not assume that his salvation\nis assured, no matter how correct in the abstract his personal conduct may be. One must\nprogress or retrograde. One cannot stand still. Activity is the law of growth, and growth,\nprogress, is the law of life. Obedience to the governing law, cooperation with others, helping\nthem to build up the kingdom of God is indispensable.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are, properly speaking, no laymen in this Church. There is labor for all, and labor, toil,\neffort in harmony and accord with established law is the only known road to progress.\nSalvation is a relative term, admitting of varying degrees. There can be no other meaning to\nJohn's revelation that \"each will be rewarded according to his works\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42228\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42228)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42228)\">Rev. 20:12<\/a><\/span>). The slothful or indolent\nor indifferent can expect no high rating, no matter how voluble in professions of faith, or how\nprofuse they may be in protestations of devotion to their creeds.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I humbly pray that each of us as we go from here will go with a full realization that\nwhatever we hope for, whatever we aspire to achieve will be dependent upon our willingness\nto pay the price in individual endeavor. We may not lean upon any other human being but\ncan be aided by the help we receive from God if we serve him faithfully and keep his\ncommandments every day, which I pray we may do, in the name of Jesus. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
