Today they have proven that these things are harmful and that we should not partake of them; and yet in spite of this knowledge there are many in the world today who are suffering ill health, much unhappiness, and even death as a result of partaking of these \u201cforbidden fruits.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/where-art-thou.p41\" class=\"\">In fact, most of the contention, strife, and unhappiness in the world are caused by our refusing to accept and live the commandments of the Lord.

Again we might ask: Where am I when it comes to teaching my family, by example as well as by precept, to walk uprightly before the Lord, to be honest and honorable in all their dealings, including the payment of tithes and offerings to the Lord? Are we keeping the Sabbath day holy, or do we compromise in certain respects? Are we observing the Word of Wisdom strictly, or do we tamper with any of these \u201cforbidden fruits\u201d? Am I aware of the increasing availability of illegal drugs, and warning my children of the dangers involved?

Are we interested in their welfare and ready to help wherever possible?

Again, where are we and what will be our destiny if we as individuals and as a country and the world refuse to repent and turn to God, and quit hiding ourselves from him?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/where-art-thou.p57\" class=\"\">How fortunate we are to have the gospel of Jesus Christ as a guide, and the promise that if we will serve God we will be saved from destruction and, in fact, enjoy life to the full here and eternal life hereafter. Christ\u2019s whole mission was to make it possible for us to enjoy immortality and eternal life, and he gave us the plan by which we can accomplish this.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/where-art-thou.p58\" class=\"\">If every family in the Church were to live the principles of the gospel, the influence for good in the world would be tremendous. And if every family in the world would accept and live the teachings of Jesus Christ, we would have none of the prevalent ills, and all would be living together in love and peace.

No one can state too plainly or emphasize too strongly this eternal truth that only through the atonement of Christ can mankind be saved. Because of his atoning sacrifice all men will be raised in immortality and live forever as resurrected beings, but only those who believe and obey his laws will enjoy exaltation and eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/where-art-thou.p63\" class=\"\">I humbly pray that we may have the wisdom, knowledge, desire, courage, and strength to overcome and repent.

Am I ashamed so that I want to hide, or am I where I should be, doing what I should be doing, and preparing to meet God? Let each of us determine to humble ourselves and repent, and prove ourselves worthy of the great promise that those who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads forever and ever. May this be our happy lot I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ.
