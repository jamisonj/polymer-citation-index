I pray that the Lord will bless me that my remarks will be helpful to each one of you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p5\" class=\"\">I am aware that you are a very diverse audience. Tonight I see beautiful young and innocent faces, shining with a zest for living. I also see white-haired grandmothers, who radiate a genuine love for the Lord. Undoubtedly some of you are newly baptized members, while others have spent their lifetime in faithful service to the Church. Among you are those who are married and those who are single, those who are divorced and raising your children alone, and those who are widows.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p6\" class=\"\">Many of you are healthy and happy and are in tune spiritually, while others bear the burdens of poor health and loneliness and may be struggling to find peace of mind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p7\" class=\"\">Some of you very likely are striving to be \u201csuper-moms.\u201d You feel a need to spend time with your husband and children. You want to be sure to have family prayer, read the scriptures, and have family home evening. You also feel the need help children with homework and music lessons; keep your home presentable; prepare nutritious meals; keep clothes clean and mended; chauffeur children and possibly their friends to school and to a variety of lessons, practices, and games; and keep everyone in the family on schedule, making sure they are where they should be when they should be there. And that is all within your family and home. It makes me weary just reviewing all of this! It doesn\u2019t include PTA, volunteer service, or caring for family members who are ill or aged. You feel the need to protect you family from the many evil influences in the world such as suggestive television, films, and videos; alcohol; drugs; and pornography. You are committed to and faithfully fulfill you Church callings. In addition, many of you must earn a living because financial pressures are real and cannot be ignored. If anything is left or neglected, you may feel that you have failed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p8\" class=\"\">To you who feel harried and overwhelmed and who wonder whether you ever will be able to run fast enough to catch the departing train you think you should be on, I suggest that you learn to deal with each day as it comes, doing the best you can, without feelings of guilt or inadequacy. I saw a bumper sticker the other day, sisters, that may say it all:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cGod put me on earth to accomplish a certain number of things.

Recognize limitations; no one can do everything. When you have done the best you can, be satisfied and don\u2019t look back and second-guess, wondering how you could have done more. Be at peace within yourselves. Rather than berate yourself for what you didn\u2019t do, congratulate yourself for what you did.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p11\" class=\"\">I give this counsel to my own five daughters and two daughters-in-law when they worry over whether they are accomplishing all they think they should. Remember, our Heavenly Father never expects more of us than we can do. If your husband and children need this reminder, then feel free to share this counsel with them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p12\" class=\"\">Regardless of your present circumstances, you devoted women in this great sisterhood throughout the world are, in your unique way, performing a remarkable service in helping to establish and strengthen the Church. Women play a crucial role in helping people accept the gospel and establish firm testimonies in their hearts.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p13\" class=\"\">Faithful women and young women who have recently joined the Church already are assisting in the work in many newly opened countries in eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union. The work rolls forward in the vast continent of Africa and is hastened through the service of faithful women. Righteous women join the Church in Asia and help to strengthen it in their own lands. Many wonderful women valiantly serve the Lord in Latin America and on the islands of the sea. In fact, dear sisters, your influence for good is felt in 135 countries and territories where the gospel is now being taught.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p14\" class=\"\">The strength of this Church from its beginning in 1830 has been and will continue to be enhanced through the faithful service of good women and young women like you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p15\" class=\"\">To each and every one of you, please know how much your leaders love you and pray for you. Also know that we understand your challenges, and be assured that regardless of your circumstances at the moment, each one of you is precious to your Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p16\" class=\"\">The general officers of the Church travel throughout the nations of the earth listening, teaching, and testifying to the truthfulness of the gospel. As we visit the members, we recognize the positive influence you dear sisters have upon this great work. We know you are loyal to the Church and love the Lord. We feel your sustaining influence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p17\" class=\"\">Be patient with the Brethren, and know that the General Authorities are teaching priesthood leaders in stakes and wards to listen to you and to counsel with you on matters pertaining to the needs of young and older women. Your opinions are valuable, even essential, to the Brethren because no one else has your perspective and insights. You have much to offer in strengthening the homes and families of the Church. We marvel at your strength, we value your service, and we rejoice in your faithful quest for eternal life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p18\" class=\"\">Through your faith and personal righteousness in keeping the commandments of the Lord Jesus Christ, you can qualify for all of the blessings our Heavenly Father has promised to His obedient children. Some of you may not have an opportunity in mortality to fulfill every righteous desire of your heart. But you can be certain that no eternal blessing will be denied you if you remain faithful and live the principles of the gospel throughout your earthly life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p19\" class=\"\">From time to time, leaders of the Church endeavor to give you guidance for your spiritual and temporal welfare. One principle that we teach repeatedly is the value of the precious freedom the Lord has given to you to make your own decisions. Moral agency enables the children of God to choose what they will believe and how they will live in mortality. Based on your obedience in living gospel principles, you will be judged according to your works. With the marvelous gift of moral agency, you can study the scriptures and the teachings of the leaders of the Church and, through the promptings of the Spirit, make correct choices that will bring peace and eternal joy to your souls.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p20\" class=\"\">Most of you are familiar with Victor Hugo\u2019s classic novel <span class=\"emphasis\">Les Miserables.<\/span> A modern composer has brought that story to the musical stage, where he chronicles the consequences that grow out of a lifetime of choices\u2014some wrong, but many gloriously right. The central character, Jean Valjean, is sentenced to years of hard labor for stealing a bit of bread to keep his loved ones from starvation. Newly released from prison, he finds food and a night\u2019s refuge in the home of a priest. Bitter and hopeless, he slips away before dawn, taking with him the silver from the rectory table. The police apprehend him and ask the priest to identify the silver as stolen property. The priest tells them that not only was the silver given freely, but that Valjean had forgotten the two candlesticks that went with it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p21\" class=\"\">Grateful and humbled, Jean vows to live a life of service to God and his fellowmen. Years later, in a case of mistaken identity, a man is brought to trial in Valjean\u2019s place. Jean now must make a seemingly impossible choice. He reviews in his mind the consequences if he chooses to step forward, identify himself, and serve his own sentence. By now, he has become very successful. He employs thousands; they will be jobless. He is the mayor; his town will suffer. He has been benefactor to many; they will have no advocate. Surely he is justified if he remains silent. From the depth of his soul, we hear the song\u2019s refrain:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Can I condemn this man to slavery,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Pretend I do not see his agony, \u2026 <\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Can I conceal myself forevermore?<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">If speak I am condemned.

At that time, speaking as the prophet of God, using words that are truly prophetic, he proclaimed: \u201cMuch of the major growth that is coming to the Church in the last days will come because many of the good women of the world (in whom there is often such an inner sense of spirituality) will be drawn to the Church in large numbers. This will happen to the degree that the women of the Church reflect righteousness and articulateness in their lives. \u2026 Thus it will be that female exemplars of the Church will be a significant force in both the numerical and the spiritual growth of the Church in the last days.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1979, pp. 1034.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p38\" class=\"\">What an ennobling phrase, my beloved sisters. <span class=\"emphasis\">Female exemplars! <\/span>What a glorious promise\u2014to know that you can strengthen all those around you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/be-an-example-of-the-believers.p39\" class=\"\">Young women, last October I spoke to the men in the priesthood session of general conference, talking to them primarily about morals.
