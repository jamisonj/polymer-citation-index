The cargo included highly sophisticated equipment which could well bring an end to the Second World War, with all its suffering, remorse, and death. The ship delivered its cargo on July 26 and was heading, unescorted, toward Leyte in the Philippines.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/in-harms-way.p5\" class=\"\">Because they were traveling through hostile waters in the Philippine Sea, the captain had discretionary orders to follow a zigzag course of travel to prevent detection by and attack from the enemy. He failed to do so. Just before midnight on Sunday, July 29, 1945, as the <span class=\"emphasis\">Indianapolis<\/span> continued toward Leyte Gulf, the heavy cruiser was discovered by an enemy submarine. Easily avoiding detection while submerging to periscope depth, the submarine fired a fanwise salvo of six torpedoes from 1,500 yards. As the torpedoes struck the target, explosions of ammunition and aviation fuel ripped away the cruiser\u2019s bow and destroyed its power center. Without power, the radio officer was unable to send a distress signal. The order to abandon ship, when it came, had to be passed by word of mouth because all communications were down. Just 12 minutes after being hit, the stern rose up a hundred feet straight into the air, and the ship plunged into the depths of the sea.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/in-harms-way.p6\" class=\"\">Of the nearly 1,200-man crew, approximately 400 were killed instantly or went down with the ship. About 800 survived the sinking and went into the water.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/in-harms-way.p7\" class=\"\">Four days later, on August 2, 1945, the pilot of a Lockheed Ventura, flying on patrol, noticed an unusual oil slick on the water\u2019s surface and followed it for 15 miles. Then the plane\u2019s occupants spotted those men who had managed to survive since the <span class=\"emphasis\">Indianapolis<\/span> had gone down.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/in-harms-way.p8\" class=\"\">A major rescue effort began. Ships hurried to the area, and planes were dispatched to drop food, water, and survival gear to the men. Of the approximately 800 who had gone into the water, only 316 remained alive. The rest had been claimed by the perilous, shark-infested sea.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/in-harms-way.p9\" class=\"\">Two weeks later World War II was over. The sinking of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Indianapolis,<\/span> called \u201cthe final great naval tragedy of World War II,\u201d is now legend.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/in-harms-way.p10\" class=\"\">Are there lessons for our lives in the horrific experience of those men aboard the <span class=\"emphasis\">Indianapolis?<\/span> They were in harm\u2019s way. Danger lurked; the enemy stalked. The vessel sailed on, disregarding the command to zigzag, and thus it became an easy target. Catastrophe was the result.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/in-harms-way.p11\" class=\"\">On the day the <span class=\"emphasis\">Indianapolis<\/span> sailed toward Leyte, I enlisted in the United States Navy. At the Naval Training Station near San Diego, California, I endured the extreme discipline of boot camp and the intense training for combat.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/in-harms-way.p12\" class=\"\">At last our first liberty came, and we were advised that all those who could swim could now take the navy bus to San Diego, while those sailors who could not were to remain for swimming training. How pleased I was that I could swim and had done so for many years. Then came an unexpected order. We who answered that we could swim were marched away\u2014not to the waiting bus, but rather to the base swimming pool. We assembled at the pool\u2019s deep end, were told to undress, and then were commanded to jump in one at a time and swim the length of the pool. Most accomplished the feat with little effort and anticipated eagerly the bus ride to San Diego. But there were men who had been untruthful, who answered they could swim when in reality they could not. For them, the petty officers waited until they were about to go under the water for the second or third time before proffering a bamboo pole to tow them to safety. The lesson learned? <span class=\"emphasis\">Tell the truth.<\/span> It could ultimately save your life if you were in harm\u2019s way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/in-harms-way.p13\" class=\"\">Our journey through mortality will at times place us in harm\u2019s way.

The influence of one\u2019s friends appeared to be a highly dominant factor\u2014even equal to parental urging, classroom instruction, or proximity to a temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The friends you choose will either help or hinder your success.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t    <span class=\"strong\">2.<\/span>\n\t  <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"strong\">Seek parental guidance.<\/span> Your mother, your father, your family all love you and pray for your eternal happiness.

From a graduate school textbook I read of an account which substantiates the wisdom of this advice. In a large factory with multiple machines, the employees had to work as a team to be successful. On a particular machine the crew was handicapped by one worker frequently arriving late. The foreman reprimanded the tardy person and told him, \u201cIf you come to work late again, you\u2019re fired!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The very next day the recalcitrant was again late.

A group of friends were trail riding on strong Morgan horses when we came to a clearing which opened on a lush grass meadow with a small, clear stream meandering through it. No mule deer could wish for a better home. However, there was a danger lurking. The wily deer can detect the slightest movement in the surrounding bush; he can hear the crack of a twig and discern the scent of man. He is vulnerable from but one direction\u2014overhead. In a mature tree, hunters had erected a platform high above the enticing spot. Though in many places this is illegal, the hunter takes his prey as it comes to eat and to drink. No twig would break, no movement disturb, no scent reveal the hunter\u2019s whereabouts. Why? The magnificent buck deer, with its highly developed senses to warn of impending danger, does not have the capacity to look directly upward and thus detect the enemy. The deer finds himself in harm\u2019s way. Man is not so restricted. His greatest safety is found in his ability and his desire to look upward\u2014to \u201clook to God and live.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote9-98905_000_022\">9<\/a>\n\t     <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10316\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10316)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10316)\">Alma 37:47<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Wrote the poet:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t\t<span class=\"emphasis\">But chief of all thy wondrous works<\/span>\n\t      <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t\t<span class=\"emphasis\">Supreme of all thy plan,<\/span>\n\t      <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t\t<span class=\"emphasis\">Thou hast put an upward reach<\/span>\n\t      <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t\t<span class=\"emphasis\">Into the heart of man.<\/span>\n\t\t<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote10-98905_000_022\">10<\/a>\n\t\t <span class=\"footnote\">[Harry Kemp, \u201cGod the Architect,\u201d in Caroline Miles Hill, ed., <span class=\"emphasis\">The World\u2019s Great Religious Poetry<\/span> (1923), 211.]<\/span><\/sup><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<\/ol><\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/05\/in-harms-way.p56\" class=\"\">Brethren, are we prepared for the voyage of life?
