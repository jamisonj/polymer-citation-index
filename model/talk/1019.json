I went to\nseek the man of Galilee called Jesus. I fancied I was in that fabulous city of Tiberius on the\nshore of the Sea of Galilee where I observed, along the water's edge, miles of palaces and\nfashionable residences surrounded by palm groves and rich gardens, gay with tropical\nluxuriance. On an almost deserted thoroughfare I saw the markets of rich merchants and the\nstands of oriental trades people.\n<\/p><p>\nApproaching a merchant, I inquired if he knew the whereabouts of the man of Galilee, named\nJesus. For a moment he just stared at me; then said, \"Where have you been? Look at this\ndeserted street. Only minutes ago he came this way going west, and all the customers\nfollowed him. I would have followed, too, had I someone to watch my merchandise.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI overtook the multitude before it settled on a little hill. Fortunately, I found myself near him\nwith sitting space for some of you out there who, in fancy, will stretch your\nimagination one thousand nine hundred years back into the past. Come quickly. He is\nspeaking: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br \/>\n\"Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.<br \/>\n\"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth\" (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34931\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34931)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34931)\">Matt. 5:3-5<\/a><\/span>; see also Matt. chapters 5-7 for the Sermon on\nthe Mount).\n<\/p><p>\nHe pauses, and arises from his sitting position upon a large rock as if to survey the multitude.\n<\/p><p>\nHe is tall in stature, perfectly formed without spot or blemish. He wears a tunic and an outer\nrobe. Sandals are on his feet.\n<\/p><p>\nHe settles back upon the rock and speaks: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.<br \/>\n\"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.<br \/>\n\"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34932\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34932)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34932)\">Matt. 5:6-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI find it difficult to concentrate on what he is saying, just for gazing at him.\n<\/p><p>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; His brow is smooth.<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; His complexion is clear.<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; His eyes are blue.<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; His hair is long.<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; His beard is brown like his hair.<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; His every feature is perfect.<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; His motions are graceful.<br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; His voice is soft and low. (This pen picture is by a Roman trader who, on the old silk road to\nChina, paused in Palestine.)\n<\/p><p>\nListen to him: \"After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven,\nHallowed be thy name.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Thy kingdom come.

It has been printed in thousands of books and uttered by thousands of\nspeakers from thousands of pulpits to millions of people.\n<\/p><p>\nAnother time, when he sought seclusion, he went into a desert place to be away from the\ncrowds. The multitude found him, and he received them. And when the day began to wear\naway, he gathered up five loaves and two fishes, blessed them, and fed five thousand people.\nAfter the feeding, there remained twelve baskets of fragments\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34962\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34962)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34962)\">Matt. 14:14-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnother time he fed four thousand, after blessing seven loaves and a few fishes\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34964\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34964)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34964)\">Matt. 15:30-38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe feeding of these thousands was only one of the many kinds of miracles he performed.\n<\/p><p>\nHe cleansed the leper; <br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;     &mdash;turned water into wine; <br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;     &mdash;stilled the wind; <br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;     &mdash;calmed the waves; <br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;     &mdash;walked on the water; <br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;     &mdash;healed the sick and the halt; <br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;     &mdash;cast out evil spirits; <br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;     &mdash;returned sight to the blind; <br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;     &mdash;restored life to the dead.\n<\/p><p>\nWords of his deeds spread throughout the countryside, even to Greece and Rome, and when it\nwas time for the Feast of the Passover, Jerusalem was crowded with people from far and near\nwho had come to see this marvelous man of Galilee. And they were not disappointed. Down\nfrom the Mount of Olives and through the streets of Jerusalem he came, riding a little donkey.\n<\/p><p>\nHis path was strewn with flowers, palm branches, and the robes of friends who watched his\nentry and who sang: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Hosanna to the Son of David:<br \/>\n\"Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:<br \/> \n\"Hosanna in the highest\" (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"33112\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33112)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33112)\">Mark 11:9-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWitnessing the procession, I fancy, were two slaves, filled with rabid curiosity.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Who is he?\" asked one of the other.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I don't know,\" was the reply.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Is he a king?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"No, he's not a king.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well, is he crazy?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"No&mdash;he's not crazy.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Then who is he?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"I don't know&mdash;he's not a king&mdash;he's something greater than a king.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNot all who watched his triumphal entry into Jerusalem were his friends. Members of the\nJewish Sanhedrin, disturbed by Jesus' miracles and preaching, and definitely alarmed by his\ngrowing popularity with the people, plotted as they watched, for his arrest&mdash;even for his\ndeath. Not many hours later they bribed one of his apostles with thirty pieces of silver to\nbetray him (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34983\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34983)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34983)\">Matt. 26:15<\/a><\/span>).\nAfter a trial of mockery, held informally, irregularly, and illegally during the\nnight while his friends, the people, slept, he was scourged, then led to a place called Calvary\nwhere he was nailed to a cross. Among his last words were, \"Father, forgive them; for they\nknow not what they do\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31511\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31511)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31511)\">Luke 23:34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe morrow was the Sabbath of the Lord their God. Lest his presence on the cross desecrate\nthat holy day, his body was hurriedly removed and laid away in a borrowed tomb where it lay\nfor three days.\n<\/p><p>\nResurrected, he tarried off and on with his disciples for forty days.\n<\/p><p>\nOne day, as he walked with his disciples on a lonely road, he paused to bless them and then\nin their presence he ascended heavenward. As he disappeared a heavenly messenger\nannounced: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . .

When she arrived, there was no place for her at the inn where she had expected to\nstay, and no one round about would give her space to stay. So a bed of clean straw was hastily\nmade for her in a manger in a nearby stable.\n<\/p><p>\nThere, Jesus of Nazareth was born. The dumb animals tethered there were the first to hear the\ninfant cry.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their\nflock by night.<br \/>\n\"And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about\nthem: and they were sore afraid.<br \/>\n\"And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,\nwhich shall be to all people.<br \/>\n\"For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.<br \/>\n\"And this shall be a sign unto you;
