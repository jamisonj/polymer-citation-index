We had been friends for many years and found it mutually beneficial to help one another. One day, one associate sought our help on a complex matter. As soon as the issue had been explained, the first thing the other associate said was, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d When his old friend responded so selfishly, I saw the look of pain and disappointment on the face of the one who had invited our help. The relationship between the two was never quite the same after that. Our self-serving friend did not prosper, as his selfishness soon eclipsed his considerable gifts, talents, and qualities. Unfortunately, one of the curses of the world today is encapsulated in this selfish response, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/whats-in-it-for-me.p6\" class=\"\">During my professional career, I helped the heirs of a noble couple settle their estate. The estate was not large, but it was the fruit of many years of hard work and sacrifice. Their children were all decent, God-fearing people who had been taught to live the saving principles of the Savior. But when it came to dividing up the property, a dispute developed about who should get what. Even though there was nothing of great value to fight about, feelings of selfishness and greed caused a rift among some of the family members that never healed and continued into the next generation. How tragic that the legacy offered by these wonderful parents turned out to be so destructive of family unity and love among their children. I learned from this that selfishness and greed bring bitterness and contention; on the other hand sacrifice and giving bring peace and contentment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/whats-in-it-for-me.p7\" class=\"\">In the Grand Council in Heaven, when the great plan of salvation for God\u2019s children was presented, Jesus responded, \u201cHere am I, send me,\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-22911_000_008\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7147\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7147)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7147)\">Abr. 3:27<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> and \u201cFather, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-22911_000_008\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38872\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38872)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38872)\">Moses 4:2<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> And thus He became our Savior.
