Cowley. He has been dead for a number of\nyears, but nothing would please me more than to have him speak through me at this time. I\nonly wish that I were as well prepared to propound the scriptures and explain\nthe gospel after my many years in the missionary service as my father was at the age of\nnineteen when he first went to the Southern States, at which time he knew by heart four\nhundred eighty-three passages of scripture.\n<\/p><p>\nI am very grateful to be at this great conference today. I am grateful for the privilege I have\nto engage in the missionary service in this Church wherever the call may take me.\n<\/p><p>\nVISIT TO THE LEPER SAINTS\n<\/p><p>\nA week ago yesterday I was in a little settlement known as Kaulapapa on the Island of\nMolokai in the Hawaiian group. That is a leper settlement. I flew over there to spend an\nafternoon with our leper Saints. It was my first experience with those people. I went\nexpecting and apprehending that I would be depressed. I left there knowing that I had been\nexalted. I attended a service with those people. I heard a chorus sing our beautiful anthem,\nconducted by an aged man, blinded by the dread disease. I heard them sing, \"We Thank Thee.\nO God, for a Prophet,\" and as long as I live, that song will never ring in my soul with such\nbeautiful harmony as came from the hearts and the voices of those emaciated lepers of that\ncolony.\n<\/p><p>\nPRESENT DAY PIONEERS\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I heard the brethren from Europe speak this morning, my heart went out to the people\nwho live in those countries. We are here today paying tribute to the great pioneers who came\nhere a hundred years ago to make this desert blossom as the rose\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25055\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25055)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25055)\">Isa. 35:1<\/a><\/span>). I have often wondered if\nwe still had great pioneers in this great Church, as great as those who came here a hundred\nyears ago. After hearing the two brethren from Europe this morning, I am reassured. We have\njust as great pioneers living today in this Church as we had one hundred years ago. When we\nthink of those who pioneered through the great war years of Europe, who have suffered the\nhorror and the devastation of their homes and cities, but who have pioneered through all those\nexperiences faithfully and devotedly to the gospel of Jesus Christ without such leadership as\nour pioneers had when they came to this desert wasteland, I say we still have as great\npioneers in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as we ever had.\n<\/p><p>\nFASTING AND FAST OFFERINGS\n<\/p><p>\nI have a message for you, my brothers and sisters. It is based upon one of the things that was\nreferred to in the statistics this morning, and I offer this message in connection with our\npeople in the war-torn areas of Europe who suffer: That message has to do with fast offerings.\nWe heard it read here that our death rate is very, very low. If we are honest in the payments\nof fast offerings, we are living miracles. We are not obeying the principle of\nthe fast, and it is a principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We are not paying to the Lord and\nto the Saints in Europe who have neither bedding nor clothing nor food, that which God\nexpects us to pay. We are paying less, I suppose, than ten cents a month in fast offering. Does\nthat represent the cost of the food we are eating or that we are refraining from eating on fast\nday? All you have to do is take one look at me and know that I know that I owe more than a\ndollar a month fast offering to this Church, and yet it was announced here that we had not\nreached our goal. What is it, one dollar a year? I don't know. The goal is, brothers and\nsisters, an honest offering for that which we refrain from eating in accordance with the plan\nof God on the first Sabbath of each month.\n<\/p><p>\nWe cannot appreciate the suffering, the wants of our brothers and sisters in the countries of\nEurope unless we fast and fast often, and we need to fast! The great pioneers who came here\nwere fasting pioneers. They were not men and women of financial means. This building, the\ngreat building east of here, all of this temple block was built, not with money, but with faith,\nwith privation, and the foundation of it all is righteousness, good character, initiative,\nindependence, self-reliance. If we are building upon the foundation which our pioneer fathers\nlaid for us here, we will not build better buildings; we will build better characters. I know that\nthis is the greatest force in all the world to develop character, to bring righteousness into the\nlives of men and women. Christ said, \"Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27293\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27293)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27293)\">John 8:34<\/a><\/span>),\nand when man becomes the servant of sin, he loses his freedom. Men who drink say\nthey have the right to drink, that is their freedom, but too often they lose that freedom by\nbecoming the servant of drink and not the master of it. Our freedom, brothers and sisters, is\nthe freedom which our pioneers brought here, the freedom to do what God wants us to do and\nwhat we ought to do, rather than what we ourselves desire and are pleased to do, and it is our\nresponsibility to hold high that great torch of freedom founded upon righteousness which\nthose great parents of yours and of mine carried here into this valley.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, in conclusion, may I say that we are all here in fulfilment of the promise of God\nthrough his prophets, that in the last days would the mountain of the Lord's house be\nestablished in the tops of the mountains and be exalted above the hills and that all nations\nwould flow unto it (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25046\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25046)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25046)\">Isa. 2:2-3<\/a><\/span>).\nWe are all here today in fulfilment of that prophecy, and yet throughout\nthe world we have thousands of Latter-day Saints, in Germany, Scandinavia, in the islands of\nthe sea, who have a burning desire in their hearts to fulfil that same prophecy just as you and\nI have fulfilled it, and their eyes are looking up, and their hopes are reaching out to the tops\nof the mountains, and the only way we have of bringing them here to us is by reaching out to\nthem where they are and seeing that they do not suffer, that they do not want for food, that\nthey do not want for clothing.\n<\/p><p>\nWe came here to these valleys to be sustained on the foundations of this Church. We must\nextend now into all the world the same sustenance which we have received here. Pay your\nfast offerings, obey the principles of the welfare plan, and let us take the mountain of the\nLord's house and all its gifts and blessings to the four corners of the earth, I pray in the name\nof Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
