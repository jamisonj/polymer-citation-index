And we are now\ncommanded to offer this restored religion to all men everywhere as rapidly as our strength\nand ability permit.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Restoration of the gospel<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOur Lord's beloved disciple John saw in vision the restoration of the gospel in our day and\nrecorded in the Bible this testimony: \". . . I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having\nthe everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen, as guided by the spirit of inspiration, he recorded that this restored gospel was to be\npreached \"to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people\" before the hour of God's\njudgment, before the second coming of the Son of Man (see\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42433\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42433)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42433)\">Rev. 14:6-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe restoration of gospel knowledge commenced in modern times in the spring of 1820. The\npromised angel began the process of revealing gospel truths and powers in September of\n1823. By November of 1831 the restoration was sufficiently advanced for the Lord to say to\nthe world through Joseph Smith: \"O inhabitants of the earth, I have sent forth mine angel\nflying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel, who hath appeared unto\nsome and hath committed it unto man, who shall appear unto many that dwell on the earth.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And this gospel shall be preached unto every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15462\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15462)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15462)\">D&amp;C 133:36-37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Commandment to preach gospel<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe are this commanded to preach the restored gospel in all the world.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are to carry its saving truths to very nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are to raise the warning voice and testify of the mighty things which God hath wrought in\nour day.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are to gather the lost sheep of Israel into the fold of their true Shepherd.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are to take the message of salvation to the ends of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nNow what have we done to fulfill the divine decree, and what must we yet do?\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the day of the organization of the Church in April 1830 to the present moment, faithful\nmembers of the Church have taught the gospel and testified of its divinity. With unwearying\ndiligence we have offered the saving truths to as many of our Father's children as our strength\nand circumstances have permitted.\n<\/p><p>\nThe restored gospel was preached in the United States and Canada, in Great Britain, western\nEurope, and Scandinavia. Soon missionaries were in the islands of the Pacific, in Mexico and\nSouth America, and in a host of nations.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Missionary service<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTen times ten thousand missionaries and more have left farm and factory, shop and store, and\nthe halls of higher earning&mdash;voluntarily and at their own expense&mdash;to devote three hundred\nthousand man years of service in preaching the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nTen times a hundred thousand and more have believed their message.\n<\/p><p>\nTen times ten million and more have heard the warning voice.\n<\/p><p>\nBut with it all, we have scarce commenced the assigned labor. We have yet to preach the\ngospel to the ten times two hundred million people in Russia, China, India, Asia, Malaysia,\nIndonesia, and so on.\n<\/p><p>\nBut this we shall assuredly do, for we are on the Lord's errand; we are engaged in his work;\nhe has decreed its overall success and triumph; and none can stay his hand.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have done as much, or nearly so, in days past and present, as our numbers and means\nallowed. At our present rate of growth, the Church is doubling in membership every 20 or 25\nyears. Will it be long, at this rate, before we have 25,000 missionaries serving at one time?\nOr 50,000? Or 100,000? Or as many as the needs of the ministry require to fulfill the divine\ncommand to the uttermost?\n<\/p><p>\nFurthermore, our means of travel and teaching are improving. Today we have jet planes and\nradio and television. Who knows what we shall have tomorrow? Whatever the scientific\nadvances may be, they shall be used for the furtherance of the Lord's work and for the spread\nof truth in the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nWith it all, however, the face-to-face and voice-to-ear testimony of the elders of Israel will\nalways be required in teaching the gospel. One elder will always have to stand with one\nbelieving soul in the waters of baptism to perform that ordinance without which no\naccountable man can be saved.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Future growth of Church<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat then of the future growth of the Church? Eventually, in a millennial day, the knowledge\nof God shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea, meaning that every living soul on\nearth shall be converted to the truth, for truth shall prevail.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the meantime, we shall go forward according to the divine timetable, a timetable under\nwhich the Lord will prepare the way for us to teach the gospel in one nation after another as\nrapidly as our strength and means are sufficient for us to do the work.\n<\/p><p>\nNephi foresaw that we shall establish congregations of the Saints in all nations and among all\npeoples and kindreds before the promised unity of the faith. Speaking of this dispensation, he\nsaid: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few, because of the\nwickedness and abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless, I beheld\nthat the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon all the face of the\nearth; and their dominions upon the face of the earth were small, because of the wickedness\nof the great whore whom I saw\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1652\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1652)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1652)\">1 Ne. 14:12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Ordinances of exaltation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnd John the Revelator recorded that the faithful in latter days would praise the Lord by\nsaying: \"Thou art worthy . . . for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out\nof every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; \n<\/p><p>\n\"And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42430\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42430)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42430)\">Rev. 5:9-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat is, before the millennial era, before the time when Christ shall reign personally upon the\nearth, the elect of God among every kindred, the Saints who speak every tongue, the converts\namong all peoples and nations, having first believed the restored gospel, will go to the\ntemples of God and receive the ordinances of exaltation whereby they qualify to become\nkings and priests.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A witness to all nations<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTruly did the Lord Jesus say of our day: \". . . this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached\nin all the world, for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30794\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30794)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30794)\">JS&mdash;M 1:31<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd truly did Joseph Smith prophecy: \". . . the Standard of Truth has been erected; no\nunhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may\ncombine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth\nboldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime,\nswept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be\naccomplished, and the great Jehovah shall say the work is done\"\n(<i>Documentary History of the Church<\/i>, Vol. 4, p. 540).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
