Dyer<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Assistant to the Council of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Alvin R. Dyer, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1958, pp. 51-53<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nEarly yesterday morning I received two very important telephone calls. One was from\nPresident McKay, and the other was from a young man who was a priest in my class when I\nwas a bishop. The time that passed from President McKay's call until I reached his office\nseemed almost like an eternity, but in actuality it was only about thirty minutes.  I can assure\nyou, my brethren and sisters, that it is a moment of great pressure as well as inspiration to sit\nclosely facing the President of our Church, a prophet of God in this dispensation, and be\ncalled to serve in such a capacity as this.\n<\/p><p>\nAs you look into the face of this wonderful man, your life suddenly becomes bare, and then\nthere is a surge of gratitude that comes over you, a gratitude not because you have personally\nbeen called to serve but because you have inherent in your heart a desire to serve, and I am\nso grateful for that feeling.  It is not because of any abilities that I may have that I have\naccepted the call, but because it is in my heart to serve the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nI think it was Nathaniel Baldwin, the great philanthropist, a very generous giver, who made\nthe statement that he was grateful not so much for the ability to give as for the desire he had\nto give. I recall so vividly the Lord, in speaking to the tired, worn, and weary Saints in the\nearly days in Missouri, when he said unto them, in substance: \"Be not weary in well-doing,\nfor you are laying the foundation of a great work, and the Lord requires the willing heart\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13634\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13634)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13634)\">D&amp;C 64:33-34<\/a><\/span>),\nand then he proceeded to say that if you do not have a willing heart to\nserve you are not of the blood of Ephraim.  So, I am grateful in my heart for the desire to\nserve the Lord in whatever capacity I may be called to serve.\n<\/p><p>\nThis young man who called me almost five minutes after President McKay called yesterday\nsaid, \"Bishop, I am one of the rascals who used to be in your priests class. I have been made\na bishop, and I need some help.  Will you spend some time with me today?\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I had the great joy of spending some time with him yesterday.\n<\/p><p>\nBut I feel the same way that he felt. I need some help, and I know, my brethren and sisters,\nfrom the many opportunities that have come to me to serve the Lord, that if I will do my\npart, the Lord will bless me, will lift me up, and give me the strength and the understanding\nto accomplish the work that is before me.\n<\/p><p>\nI think one of the great sermons that has been delivered in this Church was delivered at Far\nWest, Missouri, when Heber C. Kimball delivered what is known in our writings as the \"clay\nsermon,\" and in it he said that we should as clay to be molded as the Lord would mold us,\nand to do the will of the Lord. His sermon was acclaimed by the Prophet Joseph Smith as one\nof the great contributions to the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times in the reflection of the\nattitude that we should have in serving the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nIt seems natural, my brethren and sisters, at a time like this, to reflect with\ngratitude on the many influences that come into your life.  I think of my grandparents and\nhave since yesterday morning, of their great devotion in accepting the gospel and coming\nacross the waters many years ago.  The other day I had a letter from my brother who is now\nserving a mission in England, and he said that he had visited an old church in Coventry,\nEngland, and there on a stone plaque are engraved the words: \"The Church of the Dyer\nGuild.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful, as I re-read this letter, in the knowledge that we have had the great privilege of\ndoing the temple work for more than three thousand of this guild.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful to my grandparents who eventually made this possible, and to my mother and\nfather, who are not here upon the earth, but whose influence I feel today, for their faith and\ntheir great love of the gospel.  I am so eternally grateful for my missionary companion wife,\nwho stood by my side, not only in the mission field, but also when I served as bishop, and in\nother positions in the Church, always encouraging me to perform my responsibilities, and\nalways seemingly making it easy for me to do so.  I am grateful to her for her great faith and\ndevotion. I got so used to having her by my side that recently as I have traveled to a number\nof MIA conventions I have found myself nudging Sister Bennett or Sister Longden, thinking\nthat my wife was still by my side.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful to my fine stalwart son, whom I have never heard utter a word of profanity; for\nhis clean life, and for his great zeal to seek for an education; now at Brigham Young\nUniversity, and who has a desire to go on a mission. I am grateful for my wonderful\ndaughter.  These are our two children, but they are wonderful, and I am grateful for them and\nfor their love of the gospel and for their support of our work.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful to Nephi L. Morris, who was once my stake president, and Bishop Edwin F.\nParry, and George Lund, my scoutmaster; grateful for my brother Gus who has always lived\nby a high spiritual concept.  These are men that I think of now as I gird for the responsibility\nthat will be mine in this calling.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay has always been a great ideal of mine.  I have always looked up to him,\ntried to assimilate some of the great characteristics which he has.  You cannot be in his\npresence and hold his hand, and have him pierce your countenance with his wonderful eyes\nwithout feeling truly that here is a prophet of God.  I am grateful for President McKay; for\nPresident Richards, with whom I became so closely associated in missionary work, and for his\ngreat devotion and faith and determination to serve the Lord even against adversity; and for\nPresident Clark who has expressed so many kindnesses to me and my family.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful to these men, my brethren and sisters, and to the others of the General\nAuthorities, all of whom I know, and many of them intimately. I am grateful for them. I\nsustain them with all my heart, and will endeavor to do their bidding and to follow their\nwishes and desires as I go forward in this work.\n<\/p><p>\nI am grateful for my associates in the MIA.  I do not, as yet, have my bags unpacked from\nthe mission field, but I am grateful for the time that I have had with these wonderful men and\nwomen who are so devoted to the cause of youth, for I feel very strongly the great obligation\nwe have to preserve the integrity of our young people, and know of the great responsibilities\nthat devolve upon this organization to carry that work forward.\n<\/p><p>\nI have a testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  I know that it is true.\n<\/p><p>\nI know with every fiber of my being that Jesus Christ is a reality; that he is the Son of God;\nthat he is divine; that he is not an ethereal substance; that he is a glorified resurrected Being,\nas he is proclaimed to be by the Prophet Joseph Smith.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear record that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God; that in reality he did see God the Father,\nand his Son Jesus Christ, and that he has given to us through divine bestowals all of the\nneeded things to bring exaltation, joy, and happiness to mankind.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I know that this is his Church, and that if we will be faithful and true in\nit, and serve him as we ought to, adjusting our lives to the things that are needful, we will\nfind the joy that he has promised; and I leave this testimony with you in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
