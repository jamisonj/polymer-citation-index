However, the message from the Holy Ghost was very clear. In the days that followed, she became conscious of her habit of complaining. Grateful for the prompting to improve, she determined to count her blessings instead of her challenges.

He asked the Lord for counsel: \u201cHow can I feel at peace with all that I need to do?\u201d The answer was not what he expected;\u00a0he received the impression that he should more carefully observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy. He decided to dedicate Sunday to God\u2019s service\u2014to lay aside his school courses on that day and study the gospel instead.
