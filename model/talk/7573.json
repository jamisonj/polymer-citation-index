I learned of my divine identity in my earliest years at my mother\u2019s side. Just recently I saw my then three-year-old granddaughter learning her identity from her mother.

She could be comforted only as her mother again told Eliza\u2019s favorite true story about the special night when Heavenly Father distinctly and clearly whispered to her mommy\u2019s heart that Eliza was a special spirit with a noble mission ahead.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/my-soul-delighteth-in-the-things-of-the-lord.p12\" class=\"\">I take great delight in my role as a nurturer, which allows me to express my deepest identity as a woman.

Recently I delighted in the birth of a new grandchild into a family that understands that parents have the solemn responsibility to rear their children in love and righteousness. The older siblings had a natural curiosity about their little sister\u2019s entrance into this world. Their first lessons about this holy subject were taught by loving parents in a sacred family setting, in the celestial climate that accompanies a new soul\u2019s birth into mortality, and in the context of our Father\u2019s great eternal plan. By contrast, the next day upon returning home from kindergarten, our granddaughter reported that she had learned that day in class \u201ca big new term called sexual abuse.\u201d I felt concerned that at this early age children already have to be aware, for safety reasons, of the negative facets of the subject they had so beautifully talked of the night before.
