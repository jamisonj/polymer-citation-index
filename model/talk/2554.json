The dictionary describes <span class=\"emphasis\">wilderness<\/span> as an empty or pathless area or region, a pathless waste of any kind, a confusing multitude or mass. And thus those who aimlessly wander through life, confused and uncertain, waste the precious time that they have been given to prove themselves in this important stage of their existence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p18\" class=\"\">I suppose that at some time or other in our lives each of us has felt a little lost, somewhat uncertain as to where we were going, or in a sense, wandering in a wilderness. Let us consider some of the reasons for wandering.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p19\" class=\"\">Satan and his cohorts, including evil and designing men, are determined to keep man wandering in the wilderness so that eventually he will be destroyed and the work of the Lord will be thwarted. Adam and Eve were the first wanderers of record when they listened to Satan rather than the Lord. They were cast out of the Garden of Eden and had a period of wandering until they committed themselves to keeping the commandments of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p20\" class=\"\">Cain chose to follow Satan and, as a result, killed his brother Abel. He too was cast out and forced to wander in the wilderness of his transgressions, as were many other individuals and even larger groups of people of whom we read in the scriptures. Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because of the wickedness of the people, and there were not sufficient righteous to save those cities. You all know the story of Noah and the ark, wherein we find that all the people in the world, excepting eight souls, were destroyed because they refused to listen to or accept the teachings or warnings of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p21\" class=\"\">Some wander because they do not understand and refuse to learn the teachings and the importance of keeping the commandments of God which will assure a safe passage through life and a return to the kingdom of our Father from whence we came. They are deceived and fail to realize, as Peter said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cBut there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4920\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4920)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4920)\">2 Pet. 2:1\u20132<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p24\" class=\"\">Some are wandering into forbidden paths because they are seeking popularity with their peers, even to the extent of doing things they know are wrong.

Traffic in this area is most congested and confusing. Pornography, fornication, adultery, and homosexuality are permitted and practiced in the world today to such an extent that we are truly following the ways of Sodom and Gomorrah. There is too much corruption in the world. We need strong leaders of good character in all places\u2014leaders who are examples of integrity, dependability, and righteousness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p33\" class=\"\">Breaking the Word of Wisdom, which we have been given by revelation, causes many to wander in other sad and forbidden paths. One sin leads to another, to more and more thrills and excitement, and on to destruction. When all of us know of the many ill effects of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, I wonder why so many are led astray.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p34\" class=\"\">Improper parental example in the home is a leading cause of the wandering of youth from the principles as taught in the gospel of Jesus Christ. The use of alcohol and tobacco in the home gives license to their children to do the same, and to indulge in other drugs and narcotics, which result too often in their leaving home and wandering as hitchhikers with packs on their backs, with no purpose, no particular destination, except away from the straight and narrow path of truth and righteousness. They are really no longer free, but while claiming that they are seeking freedom, they become slaves of their own bad habits, and it is most difficult for them to come out of the wilderness and back into the light and the love which they need so badly.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p35\" class=\"\">Immorality, though rampant in the world, is denounced by the Lord and is a most sure way of becoming lost in the wilderness.

The first was about a young man who came from a family of wealth and position in their community. He had a bright mind, did well in school, excelled in engineering, and had all the promise of a good career and the hope of a good life. Somewhere along the way, and in the manner of free thinkers of this day, he chose the companionship of some who were \u201cdoing their own thing,\u201d I suppose they called it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p52\" class=\"\">Although warned of the dangers which lay ahead, he continued in the forbidden paths, experimenting with alcohol, drugs, and the gay life. Eventually he left his home and family, traveled across the country, took up residence in a community comprised of nomads, or wanderers, we might say. They were accountable to no one; they were free to come and go as they pleased; they had no responsibilities and seemingly were leading the kind of carefree lives that they thought they wanted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p53\" class=\"\">There is a sad ending to nearly every story I have heard about those who drift away from the straight and narrow path. Such a tragedy ended the life of the young man to whom I refer. Under the influence of drugs and alcohol, and motorcycling with his companions late one night, he plunged through the rails of a bridge over a murky river and was killed. In agreement with some facetious pact he had supposedly made with his friends, they, without consulting his parents, conducted his funeral service, cremated the body, and strewed the ashes over the spot where he died.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p54\" class=\"\">Imagine the grief of his parents and his loved ones who were not able even to claim his body for proper burial.

As she pulled away from his attempted embrace and said, \u201cI have a right to live my own life,\u201d he answered, \u201cYou are hurting the whole family as well as yourself.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p56\" class=\"\">As Christ suffered and died <span class=\"emphasis\">once<\/span> to save us from our sins, surely he suffers <span class=\"emphasis\">again<\/span> out of his great love for us as we reject his teachings and his plan for our well-being both here and hereafter.

Something deep within kept the boy in touch with his family. Something stirred his memory of the teachings learned in his youth, and as his family strained to the breaking point to reach out and express their love on those occasions when he made contact with them, he eventually reluctantly consented to attend a family reunion, which was being held during one of his trips home. Unshaven, unkempt, long hair and all, he went.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p59\" class=\"\">Although disapproving, the family extended their welcome and their love.

Soon he was bathed, shaved, properly groomed, and living as he should.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/11\/why-is-my-boy-wandering-tonight.p60\" class=\"\">It is honoring one\u2019s parents and conforming to the standards of decency of a well-ordered and God-fearing society that will keep one from wandering into some of the forbidden paths.
