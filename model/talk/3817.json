The purpose of this school was to prepare selected members of the priesthood to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to all the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p5\" class=\"\">In the absence of a temple, the first School of the Prophets was held in a small room in the home of Bishop Newel K. Whitney. Brigham Young was one of the early participants in this school, and he described a scene which frequently presented itself during meetings:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cThe brethren came to that place for hundreds of miles to attend school in a little room probably no larger than eleven by fourteen. When they assembled together in this room after breakfast, the first they did was to light their pipes, and, while smoking, talk about the great things of the kingdom, \u2026 and as soon as the pipe was out of their mouths a large chew of tobacco would then be taken. Often when the Prophet entered the room to give the school instructions he would find himself in a cloud of tobacco smoke. This, and the complaints of his wife at having to clean [the] floor, made the Prophet think upon the matter, and he inquired of the Lord relating to the conduct of the Elders in using tobacco.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Journal of Discourses,<\/span> 12:158.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p7\" class=\"\">In response to this inquiry by the Prophet, the Lord gave him a revelation in the Whitney home. This revelation is known as the Word of Wisdom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p8\" class=\"\">At first the revelation was not given as a commandment. It was given as \u201ca principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18011\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18011)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18011)\">D&amp;C 89:3<\/a><\/span>.) This allowed time for the Saints to adjust to the principles contained in the revelation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p9\" class=\"\">While I was on my first mission in Great Britain in 1922, some of the sisters had difficulty giving up their tea. I read that passage to them, and most of them quit drinking tea because they did not want to be considered the \u201cweakest\u201d of those who are or can be called Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p10\" class=\"\">In 1851, President Brigham Young proposed to the general conference of the Church that all Saints formally covenant to keep the Word of Wisdom. This proposal was unanimously upheld by the membership of the Church. Since that day, the revelation has been a binding commandment on all Church members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p11\" class=\"\">The Word of Wisdom is one of the recognized and distinctive practices of members of the Church. Generally, others not of our faith acknowledge that members in good standing abstain from tobacco, coffee, tea, and all alcoholic beverages.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p12\" class=\"\">Scientific studies have confirmed that Latter-day Saints have less incidence of heart problems, all forms of cancer, and other diseases because of their adherence to the Word of Wisdom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p13\" class=\"\">These studies have demonstrated that not only will one live a longer life, but also that the quality of one\u2019s life will be better.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p14\" class=\"\">The Word of Wisdom is one of the evidences of the inspiration of Joseph Smith\u2019s prophetic calling. Let me tell you why.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p15\" class=\"\">Several years ago an investigator gave this testimonial about Joseph Smith. He said that the Word of Wisdom was the revelation that most attracted him to investigate the Church. \u201cThere is no possible way,\u201d he said, \u201cthat Joseph Smith could have known what we now know in the medical world about the harmful effects of tobacco, alcohol, tea, and coffee. Yet this has all been substantiated by medical science.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p16\" class=\"\">He said that this was the beginning of his earnest investigation of the gospel, for he reasoned that if Joseph Smith could be so accurate on a matter that medical science validated over a hundred years later, the rest of the teachings of the Church deserved investigation. He did so and is now a member of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p17\" class=\"\">One principle of the gospel that all young people of the Church should understand is this: God, our Heavenly Father, governs His children by law. He has instituted laws for our perfection. If we obey His laws, we receive the blessings pertaining to those laws. If we do not obey, we receive the consequences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/a-principle-with-a-promise.p18\" class=\"\">The Word of Wisdom is a law\u2014a principle with promise.

This is what the Prophet Joseph Smith meant when he said we could have \u201csudden strokes of ideas\u201d which come into our minds as \u201cpure intelligence.\u201d (See <span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, p. 151.) This is revelation.
