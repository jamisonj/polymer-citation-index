All of the children participating here this afternoon enjoy the privilege of associating once each week with others of similar age in the meetings of the Primary. There are, however, other children, equally as sweet and precious, who are not so fortunate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-prayer-of-faith.p4\" class=\"\">Some years ago while visiting the Australia Mission, I accompanied the mission president on a flight to Darwin to break ground for that city\u2019s first Latter-day Saint chapel. We stopped for refueling at the small mining community of Mt. Isa. There we were met at the terminal by a mother and her two children of Primary age. She introduced herself as Judith Louden and mentioned that she and her two children were the only members of the Church in the town. Her husband, Richard, was not a member. We held a brief meeting, where I discussed the importance of holding a home Primary session each week. I promised to send from Church headquarters the home Primary materials to assist them. There was a commitment to pray, to meet, to persevere in faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-prayer-of-faith.p5\" class=\"\">Upon returning to Salt Lake City, I enlisted the help of then-President LaVern Parmley, and the home Primary materials were sent, along with a subscription to the <span class=\"emphasis\">Children\u2019s Friend.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-prayer-of-faith.p6\" class=\"\">Years later, while attending the stake conference of the Brisbane Australia Stake, I happened to mention in a priesthood session the plight of this faithful woman and her children. I said, \u201cSomeday I hope to learn if that home Primary succeeded and meet the nonmember husband and father of that choice family.\u201d One of the brethren in the meeting stood and said, \u201cBrother Monson, I am Richard Louden, the husband of that good woman and the father of those precious children. Prayer and Primary brought me into the Church.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-prayer-of-faith.p7\" class=\"\">The power of prayer again came to mind this past winter. I was on assignment many thousands of miles to the south in the beautiful city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. I paused by the historic Palermo Park, which graces the downtown area, and realized that this was sacred ground, for here on Christmas Day in 1925 Elder Melvin J. Ballard, an apostle of the Lord, dedicated all of South America for the preaching of the gospel. What a fulfillment to an inspired prayer is evident today as the growth of the Church in that land exceeds all expectations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-prayer-of-faith.p8\" class=\"\">In that same park is a large statue of George Washington, the father of the United States and its first president. As I observed the statue, my thoughts returned to another historic place where prayer played a vital role\u2014even Valley Forge. It was at Valley Forge that this same Washington led his badly battered, ill-fed, and scantily clad troops to winter quarters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-prayer-of-faith.p9\" class=\"\">Today, in a quiet grove at Valley Forge, there is an heroic-sized monument to Washington. He is depicted not astride a charging horse nor overlooking a battlefield of glory, but kneeling in humble prayer, calling upon the God of Heaven for divine help. To gaze upon the statue prompts the mind to remember the oft-heard expression, \u201cA man never stands taller than when upon his knees.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-prayer-of-faith.p10\" class=\"\">Men and women of integrity, character, and purpose have ever recognized a power higher than themselves and have sought through prayer to be guided by that power. Such has it ever been. So shall it ever be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-prayer-of-faith.p11\" class=\"\">In the very beginning, Father Adam was commanded, \u201cCall upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39541\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39541)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39541)\">Moses 5:8<\/a><\/span>.) Adam prayed. Abraham prayed. Isaac prayed. Moses prayed, and so did every prophet pray to that God from whence came his strength. Like the sands slipping through an hourglass, generations of mankind were born, lived, and then died. At long last came that glorious event for which prophets prayed, psalmists sang, martyrs died, and all mankind hoped.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-prayer-of-faith.p12\" class=\"\">The birth of the babe in Bethlehem was transcendent in its beauty and singular in its significance. Jesus of Nazareth brought prophecy to fulfillment. He cleansed lepers, He restored sight, He opened ears, He renewed life, He taught truth, He saved all. In so doing, He honored His Father and provided you and me with an example worthy of emulation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-prayer-of-faith.p13\" class=\"\">More than any prophet or leader, He showed us how to pray. Who can fail to remember His agony in Gethsemane and that fervent prayer: \u201cO my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36621\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36621)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36621)\">Matt. 26:39<\/a><\/span>.)

Conversely, trial, tribulation, sickness, and death crumble the castles of men\u2019s pride and bring them to their knees to petition for power from on high.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-prayer-of-faith.p18\" class=\"\">I suppose that during the holocaust of World War II more of the people living on this earth paused to pray than at any other time in our history. Who can calculate the concern of mothers, wives, and children who pleaded for Almighty God\u2019s protecting care to be with absent sons, husbands, and fathers locked in mortal combat? Prayers are heard. Prayers are answered.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-prayer-of-faith.p19\" class=\"\">Heartwarming is the example of the mother in America who prayed for her son\u2019s well-being as the ship on which he served sailed into the bloody cauldron known as the Pacific theater of war. Each morning she would arise from kneeling in prayer and serve as a volunteer on those production lines which became lifelines to men in battle. Could it he that a mother\u2019s own handiwork might somehow directly affect the life of a loved one? All who knew her and her family cherished the actual account of her sailor son, Elgin Staples, whose ship went down off Guadalcanal. Staples was swept over the side; but he survived, thanks to a life belt that proved, on later examination, to have been inspected, packed, and stamped back home in Akron, Ohio, by his own mother!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I know not by what method rare,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">But this I know, God answers prayer.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I know that He has given His Word,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Which tells me prayer is always heard,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And will be answered, soon or late.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And so I pray and calmly wait.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/05\/the-prayer-of-faith.p26\" class=\"\">(Eliza M.
