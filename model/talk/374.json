McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1948, pp. 173-177<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nWhile listening to Bishop Richards I was reminded of an incident in the life of Superintendent\nNelson, formerly Utah State Superintendent of Public Instruction. During the latter part of his\nlife he was sorely afflicted, and went back East to have performed a very difficult, indeed\ndangerous, operation. His affliction was so serious that doctors hesitated about operating on\nhim. While considering the matter they asked him several questions relating to his private life.\nThey inquired whether he was addicted to the use of tobacco. He answered: \"No.\" Whether he\nindulged in intoxicants. He said: \"No.\" Then they touched more vitally upon his life and\nasked him whether he had had any venereal disease. Superintendent Nelson said, \"Why no,\ndoctor, I am a Mormon.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, \"what the hell does that matter?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well, that means that we do not indulge in these things. It means that I never have used \ntobacco, that I never have indulged in whiskey, and that I have lived a virtuous life and have\nknown only one woman and she is my wife.\"The doctor was surprised. He used the word\nastonished and said: \"If you have lived that kind of life we are going to operate on you.\n<\/p><p>\nThey did so, and Superintendent Nelson returned home and continued his service here as\nState Superintendent of Public Instruction.\n<\/p><p>\nTonight President Raymond, in his opening prayer, expressed two very important thoughts.\nOne was an invocation that God would enable us to appreciate our responsibilities; and the\nother, an appeal that we may set proper examples, \"that we might be a light to others.\" I\nhope the Lord will answer that invocation, and that we as men who hold the priesthood may\nrealize its value.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE VALUE OF THE PRIESTHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nI have told you before of a little incident that happened in front of the Japanese Emperor's\npalace in Tokyo. Three or four of us, Mormon missionaries, were there, and with us a\nJapanese convert, a carver of ivory, wearing the cloak of the ordinary working man. As we\nstood there, I noticed the obeisance this Japanese, though a member of the Church, paid the\ngrounds and particularly the palace. I turned to him and said: \"Do you know, Brother\nWatanabe, that you have something which is of more value than all the wealth you are\nlooking at, and something which the Emperor cannot have unless he follows the same road\nthat you have followed?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe man looked up in surprise to think that he, a humble carver, would have something\nwhich was of more value than the Emperor's palace or all his possessions. And through the\ninterpreter, Brother Stimpson, he said: \"What is it?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Why,\" I said, \"it is the priesthood of Almighty. You are an Elder in the Church of Christ and\nthat is of more worth to you than all the wealth you are now looking at.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that we may so sense the value of the priesthood, and that every deacon in this Church\nwill realize that when he is given the Aaronic Priesthood he is set apart among his fellows,\nthat he is different from others. He cannot with impunity swear as other boys may swear, he\ncannot participate in pranks in the neighborhood as other boys may participate, he stands\napart. That is what it means to a twelve year old boy, and, bishops, that is just what you\nshould explain to them when you choose them to be deacons. Do not just call them up and\nordain them, but have a talk with them and let them realize what it means to be given the\nAaronic Priesthood. In the boyhood area these boys so chosen and instructed should exert an\ninfluence for good.\n<\/p><p>\nOBLIGATION TO SET WORTHY EXAMPLES\n<\/p><p>\nThe second part was example. It is our obligation when we accept the priesthood to set an\nexample worthy of imitation by our fellows. It is not what we say that will influence them. It\nis what we do. It is what we are. One reputed to be the wisest American said: \"What you are\nthunders so loud in my ears I cannot hear what you say,\" referring to the radiation of\ncharacter from each of us.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I have sat here, thrilled with this inspiring audience, and \"thrilled\" is the word, my mind\nwandered out to as many more in our wards, stakes, who never come here, and many who do\nnot care to come. It is our duty to reach them, kindly, as neighbors, officially, as ward\nteachers, officially, as members of quorums and officers in quorums. That is our obligation.\n<\/p><p>\nREOPENING OF JAPANESE MISSION\n<\/p><p>\nBut that is not the message which I have for you tonight. In giving it I am not going to\noccupy much time. I have just a few words to say regarding our missionary work. And may I\nreport for your information and satisfaction, I am sure, that recently five native Japanese\nmissionaries left Honolulu, properly set apart to go back to Japan and preach the gospel in\ntheir native tongue. We have come some distance, have we not, since that Japanese mission\nwas opened? And in addition to the elders, two Japanese sisters have accepted their calls and\nare going over there to help President Clissold in that great work.\n<\/p><p>\nLet me say in passing that Brother Watanabe remained true all through the time that the\nChurch was absent from there and he died holding his priesthood; and his daughter, I believe\nis over there now, active in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\n\"GO YE THEREFORE AND TEACH ALL NATIONS\"\n<\/p><p>\nYou will be pleased to hear also that we recently received a cable from President Stover in\nGermany that we may have a few missionaries now in East Germany. The way is opening up\nin all the world and now, as perhaps never before, those who hold the priesthood may fulfill\nthe injunction given by the Savior to his Twelve when he said: \"Go ye therefore and teach all\nnations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,\nteaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo, I am with you\nalway, even unto the end of the world\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34241\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34241)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34241)\">Matt. 28:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is most inspiring to see how eagerly our young men and young women are seeking the\nopportunity to fulfill that injunction, but brethren, in missionary work the power of example is\nmost important. It is a glorious thing for a young man to be sent into the mission field. It is a\ngreat opportunity for him. At the dinner table today friends commented upon the number of\nour missionaries in different parts of the world. What a culture they bring into our\ncommunity! One guest had two sons in Germany. He mentioned another in France, and\nanother in one of the missions in the United States. Another guest mentioned two in Norway,\none in France, one in Argentine, and so they are in different parts of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nWORTHINESS OF MISSIONARIES\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a wonderful thing it is; but, brethren, missionaries are called not for individual\nblessings. They are called to preach the gospel, to represent the Church. The blessings come\ninevitably as they do their duty, and it is most unfortunate if a young man leaves your ward\nto represent the Church who does so unworthily. It injures him, breaks his parents' hearts,\nreflects upon the ward, and it might blight some souls who otherwise would come into the\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, I am asked tonight to plead with you bishops and presidents of the stakes to be more\ncareful in your inquiries into the worthiness of the missionaries whom you recommend. Will\nyou, before calling them or interviewing them, just look over the missionary recommendation\nwhich you are going to sign? Do not just put it in the hand of the missionary and let him fill\nthe blanks, but you note the significance of these questions. If he is married, please inquire\ninto the condition of his family. Is he divorced or is she divorced? Please state why and see\nwhether or not he or she is worthy to go out and preach the sacredness of the marriage\ncovenant and the ideals of the Church in regard to homebuilding.\n<\/p><p>\nSTANDARDS OF MORALITY\n<\/p><p>\nUnder morality, answer sincerely before you put this in the hands of the member of the\nCouncil of the Twelve. Are you satisfied, after thorough investigation, that he or she\nconforms to Church standards, aye, in chastity. The world has difficulty in believing that\nyoung men in our Church grow to manhood as chaste and pure as virgins. I have had them\nsay they did not believe it; they did not believe that any young men could do that. But I tell\nthem such is the fact, and that it is the standard of the Church for young men as well as for\nyoung women to keep themselves unspotted from the world\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26070\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26070)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26070)\">James 1:27<\/a><\/span>). In the Church there is but the\nsingle standard of morality and that applies to young men as well as to young women. See to\nit that prospective missionaries realize what this means, no matter what false teaching they\nhave had in psychology or in other classes about \"inhibitions\" and so on. The standard of the\nChurch is right; it is divine; it contributes to manhood and virtuous womanhood, happy\nhomes, perpetuity of the nation.\n<\/p><p>\nAre you satisfied through investigation that he or she conforms to the Church in the\nobservance of the Word of Wisdom? And note this, in integrity. Is there anybody in the ward\nwho will say: \"Well, he has cheated me. He is not worthy. If that is the kind of men they\nhave to send out, well then, I am done with the Church.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThese pointed questions are put in the recommend purposely, and they mean something,\nbecause those who go out to represent the Church are chosen. They are set apart. They are\nleaders. They are teachers. They are ambassadors of truth. Please, when you bring these\nyoung men and young women to the members of the Council of the Twelve and place in the\nhands of the Council of the Twelve this written recommendation with your signature, be sure\nthat you have made a thorough investigation, because it is embarrassing, very embarrassing, to\nthe young man to be rejected as a representative.\n<\/p><p>\nSELECTIVE SERVICE REQUIREMENTS\n<\/p><p>\nAnother point. From questions received in person and in writing it is evident that there are\nsome problems in the minds of bishops and the stake presidents as to whom they should\nrecommend for missionary service in the light of the recent selective service. In answer to\nthese inquiries we offer the following suggestions, without going into many details. Young\nmen may continue to be recommended for missionary service as follows:\n<\/p><p>\nThose who have reached the age of twenty years, or approximately that age, or, young men\nunder twenty years of age who have had either previous military service or two years of\ncollege.\n<\/p><p>\nIf a young man receives his notice of induction from the selective service before he enters the\nmissionary home, the Church will excuse him from missionary service. In other words, if the\nyoung man receives his call in November to enter the missionary home, let us say, in the\nfollowing May, if he will register in his regular vocation as a mechanic, a student, a farmer,\nor whatever it may be, and if, during that interim, between the time of his call and his\nentrance into the home, he is selected in the draft, he is to respond. If, however, he enters the\nmissionary home before he is drafted his status changes. He is then recognized as being an\nordained minister and the government will excuse him. He will be deferred by the Selective\nboard for military service for the duration of the term he is to serve as an ordained minister.\nFollowing his release, I believe it is within five days after he is home, he is to report to his\nlocal draft board.\n<\/p><p>\nFor the present bishops and presidents of stakes will govern themselves accordingly.\n<\/p><p>\nREQUIREMENTS FOR YOUNG WOMEN MISSIONARIES\n<\/p><p>\nThe age of young women is set at twenty-three. Young women under twenty-three years of\nage, preferably twenty-one, who are engaged to young men who are in the field, may be\nconsidered as prospective missionaries, provided they can go and serve a regular term mission\nand be home in time to meet their sweethearts. Some requests are made that they may go out\nand spend a few months, some a year. Now, it is evident, if you give that a thought, this\ncannot be done for the good of the service. Presidents of missions will make certain\nappointments, assignments. Those assignments will be broken up and it is not advantageous to\nsend young missionaries out for less than the regular term missions.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34240\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34240)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34240)\">Matt. 28:19<\/a><\/span>). We are heeding that\ncall.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless the young men and the young women who are responding, and God bless the\nparents, the fathers and mothers, who in pride are sacrificing where necessary to pay the\nexpenses of these choice young men and women.\n<\/p><p>\nThat the blessings of the Lord may continue to be poured out upon the priesthood of this\nChurch, that we may in every way be honorable representatives of the Master, I pray, in the\nname of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
