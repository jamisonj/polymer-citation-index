I pray the Lord to bless me for the few minutes that I\nstand before you, that I may be able to say something that will be helpful and encouraging.\n<\/p><p>\nThirty years ago, from this pulpit, in a public meeting, I voiced a warning against what we\nthen knew as Bolshevism and Socialism, and what we now know as Communism. I thought I\nsaw it coming, and it came. No one can listen to what we have heard tonight, without joining\nin the feeling that President Stover expressed, thank God for this country and for our\ncitizenship. And there is nothing that we should not do to preserve this country, and its\nliberties, and its free institutions.\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Stover is not telling us fairy tales. He knows what happens over there, and he has told\nit in language that we can all understand. A system destructive of the great principle which\nlies behind our great plan, that utterly wipes it out and makes it as if it did not exist, the great\nprinciple of free agency.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, I do not suppose that any of you have had communistic leanings. I suppose that all\nof you love your country, love the Constitution, love the free institutions under which we live,\nlove our freedoms. But if there be any, may I ask you, prayerfully and humbly, think this\nthing over, because if it comes here it will probably come in its full vigor and there will be a\nlot of vacant places among those who guide and direct, not only this government, but also this\nChurch of ours.\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, I urge you, think this thing over in the light of the facts. And I know that Brother\nStover has not told us tonight, a tithe of what he could tell.\n<\/p><p>\nThat brings me rather naturally to my favorite theme before you brethren. \"If you are not one,\nyou are not mine\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12977\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12977)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12977)\">D&amp;C 38:27<\/a><\/span>).\nNow, that should mean, and must mean, if we are to preserve our\nfreedoms and our liberties, that we shall be one.\n<\/p><p>\nLast night I voiced the thought that I feel is sound. I can think of this Church as having three\ngreat functions. The first function is to maintain and build up the body of the Church as we\nexist, those who already belong to it. The second function is to warn the world and to teach\nthe truth to those who wish it. And the third function is to do the work for the dead.\n<\/p><p>\nWe cannot successfully carry on the latter two without having a strong central Church, and to\nbuild a strong central Church requires unity, real unity, not verbal, make-believe unity.\n<\/p><p>\nWe need unity in administration, from the deacons' quorum, up. We do not want deacons'\nquorums going off on their own and handling the meetings as they wish; the members going\nwhen they wish, and coming when they wish, and talking about what they wish. That is not\nthe way to build a deacons' quorum.\n<\/p><p>\nYou bishops of the wards, you do not want your auxiliary organizations carrying on, each one\nby itself, without any regulation or any control. You presidents of stakes do not want your\nwards carrying on in that way. And I can assure you that the presiding authorities of the\nChurch cannot do their work unless they have unity among the stakes.\n<\/p><p>\nDo not, brethren, get the idea in your minds, that you have a very unique situation in your\nown place. We hear that frequently. But when we analyze it down, we do not find the\nuniqueness that sometimes you feel you have.\n<\/p><p>\nBe a unit. Follow your file leaders. Do what you are asked to do, and do it willingly and do it\nwith a determination to make it a success.\n<\/p><p>\nYou need this unity, brethren, if we are going to build this Church and if we are going to\nfulfil the mission which the Lord has given to us.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd you need unity in doctrine. I incorporate by reference these two fine sermons we have\nheard today, one from Brother Stapley and one from Brother Bowen. I endorse all that each\nof them said. The principles of this gospel are clear and reasonably few, that we need to act\nupon. And there is only one man on earth who has the final word as to what is the true\ndoctrine of this Church and that is President David O. McKay today. When there comes a\ntime to change the doctrines of the Church, he will let you know.\n<\/p><p>\nRead your books. There is a startling parallel between the course that is coming in to us today\nand the course that was in the early Church, so startling that one becomes fearful. We have\nthese little groups going off on their own doing their own interpreting of the scriptures, more\nor less laying down their own principles. They are small now, of no particular consequence,\nbut that is the way it began in the early Christian Church, and these little snowballs grew and\ngrew and grew until they became great.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Scholasticism\" took its root among those early peoples. There were a number of\n\"schoolmen,\" they were called who undertook to define the doctrines of the early Church,\nthen developing into the great Catholic Church&mdash;Bede, Alcuin, Damiani, Scotus, and others,\nThomas Aquinas&mdash;they began the development, these individuals, of great heresies that took\nhold of the imaginations of the people and finally were adopted by the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, of course, the Church in those days was not organized as we are. The bishops were\nindependent, one from the other. They had no real, there was no real central control. The\npope exercised some, but it was very ineffective and inefficient. Some popes ruled some of\nthese heresies wrong as heresies, then later other popes came along and ruled them as truths.\nWe must be united in doctrine, we must follow the scriptures. Do not try to wander off too\nmuch brethren, I beg of you, into the mysteries. Do not write in to the First Presidency and\nask them to solve every mystery that you can think of, either.\n<\/p><p>\nThen there must be a unity of faith\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21656\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21656)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21656)\">Eph. 4:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I say a unity of faith, I am distinguishing between what we ordinarily term as unity of\nfaith, which is a unity of doctrine, and a unity of the exercise of faith. What I mean is\nillustrated by what happened at Jericho, when they marched around the city and the walls fell\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30047\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30047)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30047)\">Josh. 6:1-27<\/a><\/span>).\nWhat I am thinking about is a statement in the scriptures, that if you have faith as a grain of\nmustard seed you can say to yonder mountain, remove ye hence, and it will be removed\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34515\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34515)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34515)\">Matt. 17:20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd that great crusade under Peter the Hermit, made up in good part, of the ragtail and\nbobtail of the whole western Christian Church, who were promised an indulgence if they went\non that crusade and the forgiveness of all the sins they had committed in the past, and all that\nthey might commit in the future&mdash;I am not talking extravagantly, I am telling you what that\nindulgence really was&mdash;when the crusaders got to Jerusalem the clergy that were with them\ntried to imitate the great miracle at Jericho and so they marched round Jerusalem, but the\nwalls did not fall. Finally they took the place by storm, and one account says that the narrow\nstreets leading up to the temple mount flowed in the blood of victims up to the horses knees.\nThese crusaders, apparently dedicated to the redemption of the Holy Land from the pagans,\ntook babes and dashed their brains out against the wall, took them by the legs and threw them\nover the wall, shut them up in houses and went in and slaughtered them, piled up the\nremnants in great piles.\n<\/p><p>\nI assume if he told all he knew Brother Stover might almost equal that.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren, we must have unity in faith. Let us practice the unity, brethren, before it is too\nlate. We well may be the leaven that shall leaven the lump\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"214\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 214)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(214)\">1 Cor. 5:6-7<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23233\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23233)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23233)\">Gal. 5:9<\/a><\/span>).\nWe well may be the few that will\nsave this country, even as the Lord told Abraham he would save Sodom and Gomorrah if he\ncould find ten righteous persons (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23583\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23583)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23583)\">Gen. 18:32<\/a><\/span>).\nI appeal to you, brethren, in all earnestness, in all kindliness,\nthat we become united, united in following the directions of those who preside over you in\nthe matter of administration; united in the matter of doctrines, that we do not permit ourselves\nto be led astray, that we study the scriptures and that we hold fast to the few, simple and\nelemental principles of the gospel, which are all-sufficient to gain us our salvation.\n<\/p><p>\nI urge unity in the matter of faith, let us have faith, let us exercise it, let us fit ourselves that\nwe can exercise it, if, when, and as the time comes.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless all of us, give us his inspiration. I bear my testimony that Jesus was the\nChrist, that Joseph was a Prophet, that those who have followed him since then, including\nPresident McKay, are his prophets. Let us all give them our support, let us give President\nMcKay our support, our loyalty, and our devotion, in order that he may carry forward the\ngreat responsibility which rests upon him, and I ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
