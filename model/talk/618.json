I have come face to face with thousands of the young people of this great\nland. I have looked into their promising countenances, have grasped their hands, have shared\ntheir dreams and aspirations. I love them and I feel concern for them. I have come to feel\nthat, more than anything else, they need to be taught faith in God and in His eternal\nprinciples. They live in a world of changing standards and attitudes; but God has not changed,\nfor He is the same yesterday, today and forever\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24245\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24245)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24245)\">Heb. 13:8<\/a><\/span>),\nand His principles and commandments are immutable.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so today I should like to direct my remarks to the youth of the land, and to all who lead\nthem. They are at the crossroads, and I speak with their future happiness in mind.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus, the Great Teacher, in order to help men choose the proper course of life, the road\nwhich would bring them eternal happiness, said: \n<\/p><p>\nEnter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to\ndestruction, and many there be which go in thereat: \n<\/p><p>\nBecause strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few\nthere be that find it (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34500\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34500)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34500)\">Matt. 7:13-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo every individual comes the responsibility of choosing his way; the wide and broad way,\nthat leadeth to destruction; or the strait and narrow way which leadeth unto life&mdash;and, I should\nlike to add: to respect, achievement and happiness.\n<\/p><p>\nWith this in mind, I call attention to three of many problems with which our youth are faced.\nThe first I mention is the growing practice of profanity. Our young people\nare particularly susceptible to it. During the war many communications were received from\nmen in the Armed Forces containing alarming statements such as this: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I have been amazed, astonished, and disgusted at some of the things I have seen and heard in\nthe six weeks that I have been with Uncle Sam. I never expected to hear the swearing and\nvile talk that I have heard, not in a so-called Christian country. Where have the parents been\nto let a generation grow up so morally wrong?\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd to this question might be added: Where have the teachers of our youth been, and have\nwe of the clergy done all that we might have done?\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has never rescinded the commandment He gave to Israel of old through His great\nProphet Moses: \n<\/p><p>\nThou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not\nhold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22624\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22624)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22624)\">Ex. 20:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHave we as parents taught our children this great commandment in sincerity, so they may\nhave reason to feel their parents believe the Lord meant what He said? It is difficult to\nunderstand how a person may truly approach God in prayer, seeking a blessing at His hand,\nand at the same time be so disrespectful as to take His name in vain. During the dark days of\nthe Civil War, Lincoln issued an order to the Army and Navy which contained the following\nstatement: \"The discipline and character of the National Forces should not suffer, nor the\ncause they defend be imperiled by the profanation of the Sabbath Day or the name of the\nMost High.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe are told that he went \"so far as to admonish a certain general, who was addicted to the\nhabit of Profanity, to abandon the habit himself and to use his authority to discourage it\namong the soldiers.\"\n<\/p><p>\nProfanity is incompatible with reverence. Surely at this critical time in our nation's history,\nwhen we need the sustaining help of God, we should see that we offend Him not by reason of\nour language. I appeal to our young people everywhere to hold in reverence the sacred name\nof Deity, that they may walk acceptably before the Lord and so that should there come a time\nin their lives when they need His sustaining help they may go to Him with good conscience\nand call upon Him with faith that He will hear their plea.\n<\/p><p>\nI now pass to a second problem confronting our youth, and that is the indiscriminate and\nintemperate use of alcoholic beverages. A short time ago I was asked to speak to the inmates\nof a state penitentiary. At the close of the meeting quite a number remained to discuss their\nproblems with me, and I was invited to return and talk to the Alcoholics Anonymous group. I\nlistened to the stories of some of this group. The leader, a comparatively young man, said\nsomething like this: \"I thank God for the privilege of being in this institution.\" I was surprised\nat what he said, but he went on to explain: \"Before I came here I was no good to myself, to\nmy family, or my country. I was just no good&mdash;period. But now I have hope that when I\nleave here I will be worth something to somebody.\"\n<\/p><p>\nCan you imagine a man having followed the \"broad\" road\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34499\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34499)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34499)\">Matt. 7:13<\/a><\/span>)\nso far that he could thank God for\nthe privilege of being behind prison bars in the hope that he might be able to extirpate\nhimself, and again be able to plant his feet on the strait and narrow way \"which leadeth unto\nlife\"? (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34501\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34501)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34501)\">Matt. 7:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOne cannot go among such men without having his heart touched with great sympathy for\nthem and their families. You think of all the factors which brought them to this status. You\nthink of blighted hopes and aspirations. You wonder if perhaps their parents set them along\nthis path by reason of a bad example. As you look at a man helpless, no longer master of\nhimself, you think of the man who induced him to take his first drink.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has made it clear that our bodies are the tabernacles of our spirits. We cannot abuse\nand offend the body without offending our Creator. To our young people I\nshould like to say that we live in a time when competition, whether in war or in peace,\ndemands clear minds and steady hearts. It becomes each of us to refrain from those substances\nwhich in any way might impair our abilities or which might place us in a position where we\nno longer would feel that we were on the Lord's side.\n<\/p><p>\nI have time to mention only one other matter and I do so with concern in my heart for our\nyoung people. I speak of virtue and chastity. It is encouraging to find men and women in all\nwalks of life who are seriously disturbed about our moral standards. I state my case with a\nquotation from the \"<i>Woman's Home Companion<\/i>\" of September, 1949, under the heading \"Is\nChastity Outmoded?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Today we talk about sex with an unembarrassed frankness that would have filled our\ngrandparents with amazement and horror. This new liberty of speech has its counterpart in\nbehavior. In many circles the traditional restraints in sex conduct are considered stuffy and out\nof fashion. Chastity, say modern people, is outmoded.\"\n<\/p><p>\nPeople may have changed their thinking, but God has not changed. His laws are eternal. Truth\nis eternal. If we will save our civilization, it will be because we return to an observance of\nGod's laws.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord gave unto ancient Israel the commandment: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22629\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22629)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22629)\">Ex. 20:14<\/a><\/span>).\nAnd the Savior put His stamp of approval upon this commandment and added: \n<\/p><p>\nYe have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: \n<\/p><p>\nBut I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed\nadultery with her already in his heart\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34491\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34491)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34491)\">Matt. 5:27-28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the light of such a statement, surely no Christian can feel that chastity is outmoded.\n<\/p><p>\nAn American prophet, Alma, taught his son Corianton that adultery was \"most abominable\nabove all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8925\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8925)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8925)\">Alma 39:5<\/a><\/span>); that\n\"wickedness never was happiness\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8927\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8927)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8927)\">Alma 41:10<\/a><\/span>);\nand that \"no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8926\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8926)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8926)\">Alma 40:26<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI am happy to represent a people who have taught such from the beginning of our history. We\nare striving to teach our children, as our parents have taught us, that there is no double\nstandard of morality and virtue in the sight of God; that He expects every man to protect his\nvirtue, and that of every woman, even though it might cost him his life so to do. To the boys\nof our Church, upon entering the Armed Forces and leaving their homes, the Presidency of\nthe Church made this statement: \"Better dead clean than alive unclean.\"\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the last war, a doctor who was returning from service in the Islands of the Pacific,\nsaid to me: \"In the islands everyone lets his standards down.\" Then he added, \"But there was\na young nurse there from your community whom no man could touch. She said, 'I left my\nhome clean and I am going to return the way I left.'\" It was her faith in God, and her respect\nfor the teachings of her parents and church that gave her the courage to choose the strait and\nnarrow way, \"which leadeth unto life.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSurely her children and her children's children unto the latest generation will call her blessed\nfor the nobility of her soul. When I think of this girl, and thousands of others throughout the\nland like her, I compare them with Joseph who was sold into Egypt by his brothers and who\nlater became the savior of his father's family. Potiphar's wife tried repeatedly to seduce him,\nbut as he resisted her and fled from her he said: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23592\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23592)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23592)\">Gen. 39:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"How glorious is he who lives the chaste life. He walks unfearful in the full\nglare of the noonday sun, for he is without moral infirmity. He can be reached by no shafts of\nbase calumny, for his armor is without flaw. His virtue cannot be challenged by any just\naccuser, for he lives above reproach. His cheek is never blotched with shame, for he is\nwithout hidden sin. He is honored and respected by all mankind, for he is beyond their\ncensure. He is loved by the Lord, for he stands without blemish. The exaltations of eternities\nawait his coming.\" (Message of the First Presidency, October, 1942)\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so I plead with the youth, keep yourselves clean. Virtue may be old-fashioned, but it is\nthe foundation on which great characters, and great families, and great nations are established;\nand without it decay is inevitable.\n<\/p><p>\nI have some fear that we, the spiritual leaders of the people, in our interpretation of the word\nof the Lord with respect to the great principles of repentance and forgiveness of sin, have so\nemphasized the principle of forgiveness that an attitude of complacency is growing among us\nbased on the assumption that if we sin a little we may be forgiven to go on our way without\nloss. I am inclined to believe that we are in need of placing greater emphasis on abstinence\nfrom sin and less on forgiveness, for God has not abrogated the law that as ye sow, so shall\nye reap (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23234\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23234)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23234)\">Gal. 6:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, in conclusion, I should like to urge our youth as they go into the Armed Services, or\nas they prepare to meet life, to resist the temptation to profane the name of Deity that they\nmay be blameless before the Lord; to keep their bodies free from those substances which will\nimpede their progress; and to live according to the laws of virtue that generations to come\nmay call them blessed.\n<\/p><p>\nFinally, a word to those who teach and lead the youth of the land: Our great responsibility is\nto teach the youth, with the full power of example and precept, that the Lord desires that His\nchildren should be happy, and that the way of happiness is righteousness.\n<\/p><p>\nIf we are remiss in this responsibility, God will not hold us guiltless.\n<\/p><p>\nMy parting counsel and advice I give unto you in the words of the Prophet Joshua who said\nin speaking to the hosts of Israel: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . choose you this day whom ye will serve . . . but as for me and my house, we will\nserve the LORD (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30048\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30048)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30048)\">Josh. 24:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to choose the right and to assist others so to do, I humbly pray in the name of\nJesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
