The miracle of the changing seasons, with the reawakening and rebirth in nature, inspires feelings of love and reverence within us for God\u2019s marvelous, creative handiwork.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p4\" class=\"\">The Easter season is a good time for people everywhere to appreciate the wonders of nature and give thanks to the Creator of this beautiful world. Men and women in all parts of the world have a desperate need to take time from their demanding routines of everyday life and to quietly observe God\u2019s miracles taking place all around them. Think of what would happen if all of us took time to look carefully at the wonders of nature that surround us and devoted ourselves to learning more about this world that God created for us!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p5\" class=\"\">My family and I recently had a simple but impressive experience with one of God\u2019s creations. I gave my wife, Barbara, a dozen roses for a valentine. They were a delicate shade of peach in color and had a rich scent. Barbara put them in a vase and placed them on the table in our family room. As the days passed, the family watched the blossoms unfold from buds to full flower.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p6\" class=\"\">As I watched this miracle, I became curious about roses. I was amazed to learn from a botanist friend that there are thousands of different varieties of roses. Inside each rose is a giant storehouse of genetic coding that develops a seed or a slip into roots, stems, thorns, leaves, colors, and blooms.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p7\" class=\"\">Each rose is a compact chemical-processing factory. Using sunlight, the green leaves take carbon dioxide from the air and replace it with oxygen, which we breathe. When other chemicals within the plant react with sunlight, it produces starch that becomes food. As you know, this process is called photosynthesis, and without it the earth\u2019s atmosphere would soon be devoid of oxygen, and most living things would disappear from the earth. My friend told me that the chemical energy and the electrical energy our brains were using at that very moment were once sunlight that was absorbed by the chlorophyll in green vegetation we previously had eaten.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p8\" class=\"\">This experience led me to consider the myriad forms of plant and animal life that thrive in astounding balance upon the earth. My esteem for our little roses took on an element of wonder and reverence. I pondered the power of the creative genius who lovingly provided such marvels for his children. I thought then how important it is for every human soul to see and appreciate the glory and grandeur of God in everything about us. Into my mind came the words and message of a beautiful hymn:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">When thru the woods and forest glades I wander,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">How great thou art!

Other words that add to our understanding of reverence include <span class=\"emphasis\">gratitude, honor, veneration,<\/span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">admiration.<\/span> The root word <span class=\"emphasis\">revere<\/span> also implies an element of fear. Thus, reverence might be understood to mean an attitude of profound respect and love with a desire to honor and show gratitude, with a fear of breaking faith or offending.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p17\" class=\"\">In the book of Moses we read, \u201cAnd behold, all things have their likeness, and all things are created and made to bear record of me, both things which are temporal, and things which are spiritual; things which are in the heavens above, and things which are on the earth, and things which are in the earth, and things which are under the earth, both above and beneath: all things bear record of me\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39741\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39741)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39741)\">Moses 6:63<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p18\" class=\"\">Truly, the heavens and the earth and all things in them evidence the handiwork of God, their Creator. In the Book of Mormon we learn of Korihor, an anti-Christ who was brought to the Prophet Alma. He asked for a sign of God\u2019s existence before he would believe. \u201cBut Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9655\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9655)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9655)\">Alma 30:44<\/a><\/span>). These eternal evidences continue to testify to us today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p19\" class=\"\">Astronauts viewing the earth from space have stated how incredibly beautiful it is and how alive it appears. United States Senator Jake Garn wrote of his experience in space: \u201cIt is impossible for me to describe the beauty of the earth. It is a breathtaking, awe-inspiring, spiritual experience to view the earth from space while traveling at twenty-five times the speed of sound. I could also look into the blackness of the vacuum of space and see billions of stars and galaxies millions of light-years away. The universe is so vast as to be impossible to comprehend. But I did comprehend the hand of God in all things. I felt his presence throughout my seven days in space. I know that God created this earth and the universe. I know that we are his children wherever we live on the earth, without regard to our nationality or the color of our skin. Most important, I know that God lives and is the Creator of us all\u201d (letter to M.

I was joyfully reminded of this fact three weeks ago when our twenty-fourth grandchild was born. I was again filled with wonder and love to hold this precious infant in my arms, to contemplate the miracle of birth, and to see a child born into mortality who had come so recently from the presence of our Father in Heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p35\" class=\"\">The gift of new life brings a profound feeling of reverence. Parents and other family members are drawn closer together. Even little children sense a feeling of awe and wonder. They want to hold the baby, touch it, run their hands over its warm, soft head, or extend a finger for it to grasp and hold.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p36\" class=\"\">Welcoming this new little spirit into our family circle brought home once more to me an incredible truth.

Indeed, we are his children, his offspring, and he is the Father of our spirits.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p37\" class=\"\">We sometimes feel great respect and reverence for creative genius as expressed in great art or music. How much more should we revere the power and majesty of our Divine Creator? We may stand in awe of man\u2019s creations of beautiful buildings or bridges. But remember the Apostle Paul\u2019s words to the Hebrews: \u201cHe who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p38\" class=\"\">\u201cFor every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24530\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24530)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24530)\">Heb. 3:3\u20134<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p39\" class=\"\">Those who feel no reverence for the creations and the divine attributes of God likely will have little appreciation for other sacred things. Such a lack of veneration for God\u2019s creations may diminish until a person becomes totally insensitive to the feelings of others. This, I am afraid, is the condition in some parts of the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p40\" class=\"\">When we consider people who are irreverent, we may think of those who lack manners, sensitivity, and courtesy, and who show little or no respect for the finer things or for sacred things. Perhaps some lack reverence for life and for their fellowmen because they do not understand who they are and what they have the potential to become.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p41\" class=\"\">God expresses his love for us by providing the guidance we need to progress and reach our potential. Perhaps a simple story will illustrate this point. Recently, a young man purchased a used computer but could not get it to work properly. Soon he became discouraged. His temper grew short and he threatened the inanimate object with painful destruction unless its performance improved. A wise father intervened and took his son to a local vendor, where they obtained an instruction manual. After all, who would know more about a complex computer than the person or company that created it? Who would know most about its capacity and potential? Who would better know the safeguards required to avoid damaging or ruining this fine instrument? Soon the boy enjoyed the full potential of his computer by working within the guidelines given in the instruction book provided by its creator.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p42\" class=\"\">Likewise in our lives, he who knows most about us, our potential, and our eternal possibilities has given us divine counsel and commandments in his instruction manuals\u2014the holy scriptures.

Take time to sit on a hillside and feel the tranquillity of the evening when the sun casts its last golden glow over the horizon. Take time to smell the roses.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/05\/gods-love-for-his-children.p64\" class=\"\">All the marvels of nature are glimpses of his divine power and expressions of his love.
