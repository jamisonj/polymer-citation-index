None were professional movers, and the task of getting that gravity-friendly instrument through the chapel and into the cultural hall seemed nearly impossible. Everybody knew that this task required not only physical strength but also careful coordination. There were plenty of ideas, but not one could keep the piano balanced correctly. They repositioned the brethren by strength, height, and age over and over again\u2014nothing worked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p8\" class=\"\">As they stood around the piano, uncertain of what to do next, a good friend of mine, Brother Hanno Luschin, spoke up. He said, \u201cBrethren, stand close together and lift where you stand.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p9\" class=\"\">It seemed too simple. Nevertheless, each lifted where he stood, and the piano rose from the ground and moved into the cultural hall as if on its own power. That was the answer to the challenge. They merely needed to stand close together and lift where they stood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p10\" class=\"\">I have often thought of Brother Luschin\u2019s simple idea and have been impressed by its profound truth. Tonight I would like to expand on that simple concept, \u201clift where you stand.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Some Want to Lead, Others Want to Hide<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p12\" class=\"\">Although it may seem simple, lifting where we stand is a principle of power. Most of the priesthood bearers I know understand and live by this principle. They are eager to roll up their sleeves and go to work, whatever that work might be. They faithfully perform their priesthood duties. They magnify their callings. They serve the Lord by serving others. They stand close together and lift where they stand.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p13\" class=\"\">However, there are those who sometimes struggle with this concept. And when they do, they seem to fall into one of two camps: either they seek to lead, or they seek to hide. They covet a crown or a cave.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Those Who Seek to Lead<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p15\" class=\"\">Those who seek to lead may feel they are capable of doing more than what they are currently asked to do. Some might think, \u201cIf only I were a bishop, I could make a difference.\u201d They believe that their abilities far surpass their calling. Perhaps if they were in an important position of leadership, they would work hard at making a difference. But they wonder, \u201cWhat possible influence can I have as merely a home teacher or a counselor in the quorum presidency?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Those Who Seek to Hide<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p17\" class=\"\">Those who seek to hide may feel that they are too busy to serve in the Church. When the chapel needs to be cleaned, when the Mendez family needs help moving, when the bishop calls them to teach a class, they always seem to have a ready excuse.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p18\" class=\"\">Twenty years ago, President Ezra Taft Benson shared reports from bishops and stake presidents that some members \u201care turning down calls to serve claiming they are \u2018too busy\u2019 or they \u2018haven\u2019t got time.\u2019 Others accept such callings, but refuse to magnify those callings.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p19\" class=\"\">President Benson went on to say, \u201cThe Lord expects each of us to have a calling in His Church so that others may be blessed by our talents and influence.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-02211_000_020\">1<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">The Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson<\/span> (1988), 451\u201352; see also <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> \u201cProvo Tabernacle Rededicated,\u201d Dec. 1986, 70.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p20\" class=\"\">Oddly enough, often the root cause of both of these tendencies\u2014seeking to lead or seeking to hide\u2014may be the same: selfishness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>A Better Way<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p22\" class=\"\">There is a better way, taught to us by the Savior Himself: \u201cWhosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-02211_000_020\">2<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117270\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117270)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117270)\">Matthew 20:27<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p23\" class=\"\">When we seek to serve others, we are motivated not by selfishness but by charity.

John was a convert to the Church who left his home in England and traveled to the Salt Lake Valley as part of a handcart company. He built a home for his family in a small town a valley away from Salt Lake City. John was an accomplished stonecutter and, because of this skill, was asked to work on the Salt Lake Temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p30\" class=\"\">Every Monday John left home at two o\u2019clock in the morning and walked six hours in order to be at his post on time. On Friday he would leave his work at five o\u2019clock in the evening and walk almost until midnight before arriving home. He did this year after year.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p31\" class=\"\">One day, while he was doing his chores at home, a cow kicked him in the leg, causing a compound fracture. With limited medical resources, the only option was to amputate the broken leg. So John\u2019s family and friends strapped him onto a door and, with a bucksaw, cut off his leg a few inches from the knee.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p32\" class=\"\">In spite of the crude surgery, the leg started to heal. Once John could sit up in bed, he began carving a wooden leg with an ingenious joint that served as an ankle to an artificial foot. Walking on this device was extremely painful, but John did not give up, building up his endurance until he could make the 22-mile (35-km) journey to the Salt Lake Temple each week, where he continued his work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p33\" class=\"\">His hands carved the words \u201cHoliness to the Lord\u201d that stand today as a golden marker to all who visit the Salt Lake Temple.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-02211_000_020\">5<\/a>\n\t <span class=\"footnote\">[In Gene\u00a0A.

Moyle was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve and, eventually, served in the First Presidency of the Church. President Moyle\u2019s service in these callings was honorable, but his grandfather John\u2019s service, though somewhat less public, is just as pleasing to the Lord. John\u2019s character, his legacy of sacrifice, serves as a banner of faithfulness and an ensign of duty to his family and to the Church. John Rowe Moyle understood the meaning of \u201clift where you stand.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>The Example of Helaman\u2019s 2,000 Warriors<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p37\" class=\"\">Individual recognition is rarely an indication of the value of our service. We do not know the names, for example, of any of the 2,000 sons of Helaman. As individuals, they are unnamed. As a group, however, their name will always be remembered for honesty, courage, and the willingness to serve. They accomplished together what none of them could have accomplished alone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p38\" class=\"\">That is a lesson for us, brethren of the priesthood. When we stand close together and lift where we stand, when we care more for the glory of the kingdom of God than for our own prestige or pleasure, we can accomplish so much more.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>Every Calling Is an Opportunity to Serve and Grow<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p40\" class=\"\">No calling is beneath us. Every calling provides an opportunity to serve and to grow. The Lord organized the Church in a way that offers each member an opportunity for service, which, in turn, leads to personal spiritual growth. Whatever your calling, I urge you to see it as an opportunity not only to strengthen and bless others but also to become what Heavenly Father wants you to become.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p41\" class=\"\">When traveling to the stakes of Zion for the purpose of reorganizing a stake presidency, I have sometimes been surprised when, during an interview, a brother would tell me that he had received an impression that he would be in the next presidency.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p42\" class=\"\">When I first heard this, I wasn\u2019t sure how to react.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p43\" class=\"\">It took some time before the Holy Spirit gave me understanding. I believe that the Lord has a certain calling for every man. Sometimes He grants spiritual promptings telling us that we are <span class=\"emphasis\">worthy<\/span> to receive certain callings. This is a spiritual blessing, a tender mercy from God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/11\/lift-where-you-stand.p44\" class=\"\">But sometimes we do not hear the rest of what the Lord is telling us. \u201cAlthough you are worthy to serve in this position,\u201d He may say, \u201cthis is not my calling for you.

But, of course, he can\u2019t\u2014and he shouldn\u2019t. The Lord has not asked him to do that. The Lord has asked us, as home teachers, to love and watch over our assigned families.
