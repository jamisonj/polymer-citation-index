Merrill, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1951, pp. 134-139<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nBrethren, sisters, and radio listeners: During the few minutes allotted to me, I purpose talking\nabout a few matters that I feel are important enough to justify my asking your attention to\nthem. They are not new, but they are current and vitally concern us in our daily lives. They\nhave been much discussed but are in need of more attention than they have yet received from\nmany of us. They have to do with both our material and spiritual well-being. They are\ndirected to our own Church people, but we invite all others to consider them.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Apostle Paul wrote, as you know, these words: \n<\/p><p>\nKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\n<\/p><p>\nIf any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is\nholy, which temple ye are (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"203\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 203)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(203)\">1 Cor. 3:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE WORD OF WISDOM\n<\/p><p>\nAs a means of preserving our bodies from certain types of defilement (destruction), the Lord\ngave to the Church in its very beginning, and to the human family generally, a revelation that\nhas properly been called a law of health, better known among us as the Word of Wisdom,\nprinted as section eighty-nine of the book of Doctrine and Covenants\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12918\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12918)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12918)\">D&amp;C 89:1-21<\/a><\/span>). Years ago I was present\nin a meeting where a prominent non-Mormon doctor of medicine referred to the Word of\nWisdom as the Lord's Law of Health and said so far as he knew it was the best brief\nstatement in the English language of the conditions that must be observed if good health\ncontinued. This is a truth related not only to the material world but to the spiritual realm as\nwell, as has been said several times in this conference, quoting Joseph Smith in the Doctrine\nand Covenants. We get no blessing from God except by obeying the law upon which the\nblessing is predicated (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12947\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12947)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12947)\">D&amp;C 130:21<\/a><\/span>).\nI repeat, good health is continued only if we obey the laws of health.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the revelation referred to, the Lord said liquor and tobacco are not good for man\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12922\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12922)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12922)\">D&amp;C 89:5,8<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;truths\nthat have since been abundantly confirmed by the observations and research work of\nhighly-qualified investigators. However, in the revelation the Lord did not give reasons, it was\nunnecessary to do so. Some of them were already known. The Lord knew others would be\ndiscovered by his inquisitive children.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us summarize a few of the authoritative statements relative to the effects of liquor and\ntobacco. As to tobacco, it contains nicotine, one of the most deadly poisons known to the\npharmacist. It affects injuriously the heart, the brain and mental powers, the nervous system,\nthe kidneys and elimination organs, the muscular system, etc., thus weakening the body with\nthe result that it is less resistant to various kinds of disease.\n<\/p><p>\nFACTS ABOUT TOBACCO\n<\/p><p>\nDr. Irving Fisher of Yale University, long noted as a writer on matters relative to human\nhealth, wrote, among other things in the preface to Dr. Frank L. Wood's book\n<i>What You Should Know about Tobacco<\/i>, the following: \n<\/p><p>\nI have had unusual opportunities to become familiar with the many sided tobacco\nproblem. The evidence now exists sufficient to show that no one who smokes can\nachieve the best of which he or she is capable. whether this be a foot race, a prize\nfight, a golf game, a rifle score, writing, speaking, singing, acting, performing on\nviolin, piano, or typewriter, attainment of health, strength, endurance, beauty, glamour,\nor any other excellence on which men and women set their hearts. It is time that those\nambitious in all other lines of work should also learn the truth that tobacco harms,\nnever helps.\n<\/p><p>\nThe use of tobacco shortens life, This fact was satisfactorily demonstrated to the scientific\nworld by Dr. Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins University, who published fifteen years ago a\nresearch paper in which he showed that on an average heavy smokers die about ten years\nsooner than non-smokers and moderate smokers from three to five years sooner. Everybody\nknows that college athletic coaches do not permit their boys to smoke. Yes, the use of tobacco\nis injurious to man.\n<\/p><p>\nEFFECTS OF ALCOHOL\n<\/p><p>\nNow relative to alcohol: Some of the facts relative to the injurious effects of consumed\nalcohol are briefly stated by the eminent authority, Dr, Haven Emerson, as follows: \n<\/p><p>\n1. We have learned that alcohol, as commonly used today, causes more diseases,\ndisability, and death than any other cause of ill health which is wholly in the power of\nthe individual to prevent and avoid.\n<\/p><p>\n2. Medical sciences have learned and found that alcohol is not a food, a stimulant, or\nharmful only in drunkenness. That was the former belief. The liver, stomach, and heart\nwere supposed to suffer only from drunkenness. Those are the least of the damages\nalcohol causes. Deaths from alcoholism are the least of the harm that alcohol causes. It\nis the constant and severe interference with human relations, the disturbance of the\nconduct of people to each other, that is the major damage that alcohol does in our\nsociety today.\n<\/p><p>\n3. Alcohol is a depressant narcotic drug, not a stimulant. That cannot be too often\nrepeated. The effects of alcohol are almost entirely, if not wholly, to be experienced\nby its toxic damage to the central nervous system, the brain, and spinal cord. It is upon\nthose tissues that the action of alcohol shows most strikingly. The only thing that\ndistinguishes man from the brute is his power of self-direction, self-control, judgment,\ndiscretion. Those things are the first qualities of man that are destroyed by alcohol,\nlong before there is any obvious interference with the muscles and motor functions of\nthe body.\n<\/p><p>\n4. Alcohol is not describable as a food which forms any part of a wholesome diet.\n<\/p><p>\n5. In recent times, it has been observed that the lifesaving reflexes of the body are all\nslowed from five to ten percent by amounts of alcohol too small to be socially\nappreciable, and in amounts far smaller than can ever be registered under the law or\nby the police as indicating intoxication. In amounts too small to be appreciated,\nalcohol slows the reflexes of the body, which we are endowed with to protect\nourselves from destruction&mdash;the nervous reflex action of the eye, the ear, the\nmuscles&mdash;which we depend on in this world of speed and power and uncontrolled human\nassociation. The evidence shows there is no form of human activity so far tested which\ndoes not show inferiority of performance as the invariable sequel of the absorption of\nalcohol in amounts smaller than would be recognized as of toxic significance.\n<\/p><p>\n6. Perhaps the most important of all is the positive statement that no evidence of\nimprovement in human health has so far been found to result from the use of alcohol\nin the normal human being.\n<\/p><p>\n7. Alcohol, as used, causes many times more deaths than the infectious diseases.\n<\/p><p>\nCAUSE OF HIGHWAY ACCIDENTS\n<\/p><p>\nThus writes Dr. Haven Emerson, a world-recognized authority on the effects of alcohol on the\nhuman body. Scientific observations and experiments absolutely prove that alcohol in amounts\nas small as only \"a drink or two\" causes a slowing of the reflexes of the body sufficient to\nresult in many highway accidents. But the driver usually believes that this small amount\nmakes him more alert&mdash;a safer driver after the drink than before. But this is not the case, as\nevery traffic officer knows. Alcohol is a deceiver; it lies to the driver. Instead of making him\nmore alert, it really makes him less alert and less safe in his driving. According to the\nestimates of the National Safety Council, and others qualified to give estimates, from\ntwenty-five to forty percent of all highway accidents are due to drinking drivers&mdash;the\nmajority of them having had, so they say, only \"a drink or two.\" Such a driver is far more\ndangerous than the one who knows he is drunk.\n<\/p><p>\nThis matter of traffic accidents in the United States is very important. It is said that they\nresulted last year in thirty-six thousand fatalities&mdash;more fatalities than we suffered during the\nsame period in the Korean War.\n<\/p><p>\nSOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL EFFECTS\n<\/p><p>\nSo far I have spoken only of the effects of alcohol on the body of the drinker, but there are\nsocial and spiritual effects of far greater importance that result from his drinking.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is perhaps not so important what the drinker does to himself great as this is&mdash;as to what he\ndoes to others&mdash;how his drinking affects others. At the conference of the American\nAssociation of Industrial Physicians and Surgeons last April, it was said by the medical\ndirector of a large steel company that hangovers cost factories one billion man-hours every\nyear, a tremendous loss in goods and wages, thus affecting many more people than the\ndrinkers.\n<\/p><p>\nFIRST PRESIDENCY MESSAGE\n<\/p><p>\nIn a session of the October conference of the Church in 1942, President Clark presented a\ntimely message of the First Presidency in which was written the following: \n<\/p><p>\nOver the earth, and it seems particularly in America, the demon drink is in control.\nDrunken with strong drink, men have lost their reason; their counsel has been\ndestroyed; their judgment and vision are fled; they reel forward to destruction.\n<\/p><p>\nDrink brings cruelty into the home; it walks arm and arm with poverty; its companions\nare disease and plague; it puts chastity to flight; it knows neither honor nor fair\ndealing; it is a total stranger to truth; it drowns conscience; it is the bodyguard of evil;\nit curses all who touch it.\n<\/p><p>\nDrink has brought more woe and misery, broken more hearts, wrecked more homes,\ncommitted more crimes, filled more coffins, than all the wars the world has suffered.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the light of these factual statements, forcibly and eloquently put by President Clark, how is\nit that any sane member of the Church believing in the divine call of Joseph Smith, would\ndare to indulge in drink? Does he not know the sin and the danger of indulgence? This action\nnot only harms him in person, thus defiling his body, but it makes him a danger to his family,\nto his associates, to society, and an offender of God.\n<\/p><p>\nDANGER OF MODERATE DRINKING\n<\/p><p>\nBut there are many people who protest that drinking in moderation is not harmful. Have I not\npointed out that the most dangerous potential killer on the highway is the driver who has\ntaken only \"a drink or two\"? Is it not through example that we yield our most potent\ninfluence? Drinking a single glass is likely far more strongly to influence others to drink than\nwould drinking a jug, Yes, the example of participation in a cocktail party, of drinking in a\nconvivial set, of taking a glass with a friend&mdash;any of these is likely to be taken as a license\nby the unwary to indulge.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a grave danger in alcohol of which the novice may not be aware&mdash;the danger of\nbecoming an alcoholic of becoming one who drinks to excess, unable to control his drinking.\nMrs. Marty Mann, a recovered alcoholic, executive director, National Committee for\nEducation on Alcoholism, said a few years ago in a national radio broadcast that the years of\nher acute chronic alcoholism were the most painful years of her life. \"I suffered constantly,\"\nshe said \"not just one kind of pain, but <i>all<\/i> kinds of pain. I suffered physically mentally,\nemotionally, financially, and socially&mdash;in every department of my life. I tell you, honestly,\nand on behalf of those three million human beings (alcoholics) that alcoholism is\n<i>the most painful<\/i> disease known to man.\"\n<\/p><p>\nA careful study shows that about one of every sixteen persons who takes his first glass\nbecomes an alcoholic. But whether this will be his fate cannot be determined in advance,\nstrange as it may seem. Hence, safety demands a refusal to take the first drink.\n<\/p><p>\nBut it is not always easy to say, \"I do not drink.\" Natural curiosity to learn how the stuff\ntastes, the invitation of agreeable companions, the fear of being regarded as a sissy or of\nleaning over backwards, or of throwing a damper on a jolly group, memory of attractive\nadvertisements seen or read&mdash;one or more of these and other temptations must be waved\naside by a refusal. But the fact that it is \"smarter not to drink\" is a truth that will give the\nnecessary courage to everyone who is accustomed to pray and to respect himself. The Lord\nhelps him who worthily tries to help himself.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE PROBLEM OF DRINK\n<\/p><p>\nThe problem of drink looked at in the light of national interests is one of the most difficult\nand dangerous this country faces. The  custom of drinking prevails in all strata of American\nSociety, among the rich and the poor, the old and the young, the educated and the ignorant,\nthe strong and the weak, the official and the military. Drink is responsible, in part at least, for\nmany of our existing difficulties. The per capita consumption in the District of Columbia is\nmuch the highest in the country&mdash;5.37 gallons in 1951, compared with 1.24 gallons for the\nwhole United States, more than four times greater in Washington than the average. The\nconsumption in Utah was 0.74 gallons, fourteen percent of that in Washington.\n<\/p><p>\nDoes this great consumption in Washington have any significance? It was reported that at the\nconferences with Stalin at Teheran and Yalta during the war an abundance of liquor was in\nevidence. Did the presence of liquor have any influence on the harmful agreements (harmful\nto us) that were reached?\n<\/p><p>\nCrime in its many varieties is current in the United States, and the records show that nearly\nall criminals use liquor and tobacco. And as you know, many crimes are committed because\nthe perpetrator is under the influence of liquor. As you also know, many destructive fires,\ncausing loss of many lives and enormous losses of property, are due to the carelessness of\nsmokers.\n<\/p><p>\nEVILS OF INDULGENCE\n<\/p><p>\nIndulgence in alcoholic beverages and tobacco is not only injurious to body, mind, and\nspirit&mdash;therefore hurtful to the consumer and greatly so to society&mdash;but it is very expensive,\nestimated to be about fifteen billion dollars annually in the United States&mdash;more than is spent\nfor education, libraries, and charity. The picture is dismal indeed. Why is it, how is it, that\nintelligent, sensible human beings will persist in consuming liquor and tobacco in the light of\nthe many, some dreadful, evils resulting from this consumption? Can it be that they are not\nwell-informed of these effects? This is probably true in many cases, especially with the youth.\nHence education is one of the means that should be employed intensively among all\nill-informed persons. So many and great are the evils of indulgence that all feasible means\nshould be employed to eliminate them. Certainly all schools should participate in this\nmovement.\n<\/p><p>\nBut as this movement is intensified, so will counter movements be, we may be assured;\n\"conspiring men\" will intensify their \"evils and designs\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12921\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12921)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12921)\">D&amp;C 89:4<\/a><\/span>). Satan, the devil, is not asleep.\n<\/p><p>\nBut Latter-day Saints&mdash;members of this Church&mdash;believing and knowing that God has\nspoken in modern times on the subject of liquor and tobacco, will you not be aroused, become\nconverted and abstain from indulgence in the use of these things? Nothing less is expected of\nyou by the Church and by non-members who know our teachings relative to them. Be wise,\nnot foolish.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord help all of us to be sincerely obedient to his will, I pray in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
