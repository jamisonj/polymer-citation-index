Such was a young boy in Kirtland, Isaac Russell, of Missouri, and\n  Gladden Bishop, and Oliver Olney of Nauvoo. The boy is now living with his parents who have\n  submitted to the laws of the Church.<span class=\"footRef\">2<\/span> Mr. Russell stayed in Far West, from whence he was to go to\n  the Rocky Mountains, led by three Nephites;<span class=\"footRef\">3<\/span> but the Nephites never came, and his friends forsook\n  him, all but some of the blood relations, who have since been nearly destroyed by the mob. Mr.\n  Bishop was tried by the High Council, his papers examined, condemned and burned, and he cut off\n  the Church. He acknowledged the justice of the decision, and said &ldquo;that he now saw his error, for\n  if he had been governed by the revelations given before, he might have known that no man was to\n  write revelations for the Church, but Joseph Smith,&rdquo;<span class=\"footRef\">4<\/span> and begged to be prayed for,<span class=\"footRef\">5<\/span> and forgiven by\n  the brethren. Mr. Olney has also been tried by the High Council and disfellowshiped, because he\n  would not have his writings tested by the word of God;<span class=\"footRef\">6<\/span> evidently proving that he loves darkness\n  rather than light, because his deeds are evil.<span class=\"footRef\">7<\/span>  (April 1, 1842) DHC 4:571-581.<\/p>\n  <div class=\"topic \">Remarks of the Prophet at the Funeral of Ephraim Marks<\/div>\n  <p class=\"std\">The Saints in Nauvoo assembled at the house of President Marks, at an early hour in the\n  morning, to pay their last respects to the body of Ephraim Marks, son of President William Marks,\n  who died on the evening of the 7th. A large procession formed and walked to the Grove, where a\n  numerous congregation had assembled. President Joseph Smith spoke upon the occasion with much\n  feeling and interest. Among his remarks he said, &ldquo;It is a very solemn and awful time. I never felt\n  more solemn; it calls to mind the death of my oldest brother, Alvin,<span class=\"footRef\">8<\/span> who died in New York, and my\n  youngest brother, Don Carlos Smith,<span class=\"footRef\">9<\/span> who died in Nauvoo. It has been hard for me to live on earth\n  and see these young men upon whom we have leaned for support and comfort taken from us in the\n  midst of their youth. Yes, it has been hard to be reconciled to these things. I have sometimes thought\n  that I should have felt more reconciled to have been called away myself if it had been the will of\n  God; yet I know we ought to be still and know it is of God,<span class=\"footRef\">10<\/span><\/p>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    <div class=\"footnote\">1. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"113507\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 113507)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(113507)\">D&amp;C 28:11-12<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">2. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"114075\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 114075)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(114075)\">D&amp;C 58:23<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"114596\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 114596)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(114596)\">D&amp;C 83:1<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"115511\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 115511)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(115511)\">D&amp;C 107:79<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">3. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112764\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112764)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112764)\">4 Ne. 1:37<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">4. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"113116\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 113116)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(113116)\">D&amp;C 5:10<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">5. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"112643\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 112643)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(112643)\">3 Ne. 18:30<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">6. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"107040\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 107040)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(107040)\">Isa. 8:20<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">7. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"108651\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 108651)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(108651)\">John 3:19<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"113190\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 113190)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(113190)\">D&amp;C 10:21<\/a><\/span>;\n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"113550\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 113550)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(113550)\">D&amp;C 29:45<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">8. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"116616\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 116616)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(116616)\">D&amp;C 137:5-6<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">9. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"117093\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117093)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117093)\">JS&mdash;H 1:4<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"footnote\">10. \n      <span class=\"citation\" id=\"106721\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 106721)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(106721)\">Ps. 46:10<\/a><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>"}
