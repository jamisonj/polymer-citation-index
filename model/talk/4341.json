I recall vividly how the spirit of missionary work came into my life. I was about thirteen years of age when my father received a call to go on a mission. It was during an epidemic in our little community of Whitney, Idaho. Parents were encouraged to go to sacrament meeting, but the children were to remain home to avoid contracting the disease.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p13\" class=\"\">Father and Mother went to sacrament meeting in a one-horse buggy. At the close of the meeting, the storekeeper opened the store just long enough for the farmers to get their mail, since the post office was in the store. There were no purchases, but in this way the farmers saved a trip to the post office on Monday. There was no rural postal delivery in those days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p14\" class=\"\">As Father drove the horse homeward, Mother opened the mail, and, to their surprise, there was a letter from Box B in Salt Lake City\u2014a call to go on a mission. No one asked if one were ready, willing, or able. The bishop was supposed to know, and the bishop was Grandfather George T. Benson, my father\u2019s father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p15\" class=\"\">As Father and Mother drove into the yard, they were both crying\u2014something we had never seen in our family. We gathered around the buggy\u2014there were seven of us then\u2014and asked them what was the matter.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p16\" class=\"\">They said, \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cWhy are you crying then?\u201d we asked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cCome into the living room and we\u2019ll explain.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p19\" class=\"\">We gathered around the old sofa in the living room, and Father told us about his mission call. Then Mother said, \u201cWe\u2019re proud to know that Father is considered worthy to go on a mission. We\u2019re crying a bit because it means two years of separation. You know, your father and I have never been separated more than two nights at a time since our marriage\u2014and that\u2019s when Father was gone into the canyon to get logs, posts, and firewood.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p20\" class=\"\">And so Father went on his mission. Though at the time I did not fully comprehend the depths of my father\u2019s commitment, I understand better now that his willing acceptance of this call was evidence of his great faith. Every holder of the priesthood, whether young or old, should strive to develop that kind of faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p21\" class=\"\">Peter goes on to say that we must add to our faith <span class=\"emphasis\">virtue.<\/span> A priesthood holder is <span class=\"emphasis\">virtuous.<\/span> Virtuous behavior implies that he has pure thoughts and clean actions. He will not lust in his heart, for to do so is to \u201cdeny the faith\u201d and to lose the Spirit (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"18431\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 18431)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(18431)\">D&amp;C 42:23<\/a><\/span>)\u2014and there is nothing more important in this work than the Spirit.

This means fornication, homosexual behavior, self-abuse, child molestation, or any other sexual perversion. This means that a young man will honor young women and treat them with respect.

How can any man indulge himself in the evils of pornography, profanity, or vulgarity and consider himself totally virtuous?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p24\" class=\"\">Whenever a priesthood holder departs from the path of virtue in any form or expression, he loses the Spirit and comes under Satan\u2019s power. He then receives the wages of him whom he has chosen to serve. As a result, sometimes the Church must take disciplinary action, for we cannot condone or pardon unvirtuous and unrepentant actions. All priesthood holders must be morally clean to be worthy to bear the authority of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p25\" class=\"\">The next step Peter describes in the growth process is to add <span class=\"emphasis\">knowledge<\/span> to our faith and virtue.

Every priesthood holder should make learning a lifetime pursuit. While any study of truth is of value, the truths of salvation are the most important truths any person can learn. The Lord\u2019s question \u201cFor what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37129\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37129)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37129)\">Matt. 16:26<\/a><\/span>) can be applied to educational pursuits as well as the pursuit of worldly goods.

To leave seven children and an expectant wife at home alone for two years, how could that be true love?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p47\" class=\"\">But my father knew a greater vision of love. He knew that \u201call things shall work together for good to them that love God\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42918\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42918)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42918)\">Rom. 8:28<\/a><\/span>). He knew that the best thing he could do for his family was to obey God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p48\" class=\"\">While we missed him greatly during those years, and while his absence brought many challenges to our family, his acceptance proved to be a gift of charity. Father went on his mission, leaving Mother at home with seven children. (The eighth was born four months after he arrived in the field.) But there came into that home a spirit of missionary work that never left it. It was not without some sacrifice. Father had to sell our old dry farm in order to finance his mission. He had to move a married couple into part of our home to take care of the row crops, and he left his sons and wife the responsibility for the hay land, the pasture land, and a small herd of dairy cows.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p49\" class=\"\">Father\u2019s letters were indeed a blessing to our family. To us children, they seemed to come from halfway around the world, but they were only from Springfield, Massachusetts; and Chicago, Illinois; and Cedar Rapids and Marshalltown, Iowa. Yes, there came into our home, as a result of Father\u2019s mission, a spirit of missionary work that never left it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p50\" class=\"\">Later the family grew to eleven children\u2014seven sons and four daughters. All seven sons filled missions, some of them two or three missions. Later, two daughters and their husbands filled full-time missions. The two other sisters, both widows\u2014one the mother of eight and the other the mother of ten\u2014served as missionary companions in Birmingham, England.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1986\/11\/godly-characteristics-of-the-master.p51\" class=\"\">It is a legacy that still continues to bless the Benson family even into the third and fourth generations.

If this is true, and I bear you my solemn witness that it <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> true, then we must ask how we come to know God.
