Frequent, long, and heartfelt prayers by the Savior have set a powerful example for us to follow. The Father\u2019s love for His Son was ever apparent, particularly at the time of His baptism by John: \u201cAnd lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33728\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33728)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33728)\">Matt. 3:17<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/come-follow-me.p9\" class=\"\">The unity between the two was apparent when the Savior said, \u201cI and my Father are one\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27055\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27055)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27055)\">John 10:30<\/a><\/span>).

Nevertheless, prayer is a powerful action principle. The Savior said that if one has faith and doubts not, \u201call things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"33777\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33777)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33777)\">Matt. 21:21\u201322<\/a><\/span>).

Although having the next-door neighbors over for dinner is a wonderful way to express love, the Savior chose a much more difficult example when the lawyer asked Him the question, \u201cAnd who is my neighbour?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31066\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31066)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31066)\">Luke 10:29<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/come-follow-me.p11\" class=\"\">There follows the familiar story of a man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho when he was robbed and beaten and left by the roadside half dead. The Levite and the priest looked on him and passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, who was despised by the Jews, had compassion and cared for him. The Samaritan did not ask about ethnicity before showing mercy. Jesus concluded this powerful story with the admonition to \u201cgo, and do thou likewise\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31068\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31068)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31068)\">Luke 10:37<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/come-follow-me.p12\" class=\"\">In every big city, we have those who are beaten down and left by the roadside\u2014those who are homeless, destitute, hungry, and sick. Some say that by giving them money we only support their habit of drug or alcohol addiction, thus enabling them to continue a lifestyle they have chosen. It is so easy to judge these individuals and, like Job\u2019s friends, speculate about all the mistakes they have made in their lives that brought this great misery upon them (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"26630\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26630)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26630)\">Job 22<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"40171\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40171)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40171)\">Mosiah 4:17<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/come-follow-me.p13\" class=\"\">Before we pass by like the Levite and the priest, however, let us consider the admonition of the Savior to \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d Remember that the Savior was homeless, had only the clothes on His back, and was often hungry.

These qualities include love, meekness, humility, compassion, thirsting after righteousness, being prayerful, merciful, and pure in heart. We should never judge others but should do unto our neighbor as we would have them do unto us. He taught that we should be the salt of the earth and a light unto the world. He said that what a man thinketh in his heart is as important as his outward actions. We were told to forgive everyone, including our debtors, and to love our enemies. Not only are we to be peacemakers, but we are also to rejoice in persecution. He advised us to give our alms and to fast and pray in secret. He taught us to turn the other cheek and to go the extra mile. He especially cautioned us to lay up treasures in heaven rather than treasures on earth.

It is of interest, however, that during the first 30 years of His life in Nazareth, Jesus apparently drew little attention to Himself even though He was living a sinless life (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"33763\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33763)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33763)\">Matt. 13:54\u201356<\/a><\/span>; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"32958\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32958)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32958)\">Mark 6:2\u20133<\/a><\/span>). That should encourage us to do better in our own quiet and humble way without drawing attention to ourselves. The admonition to \u201cCome, follow me\u201d and the question \u201cWhat would Jesus do?\u201d provide powerful guidelines for living. Paying more attention to these guidelines will help all of us become more Christlike in our thoughts and actions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/come-follow-me.p26\" class=\"\">Of the Savior, who is our exemplar, I bear personal witness that He lives.
