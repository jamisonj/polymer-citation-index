I wish we might have heard from these Brethren [Elders Ringger, Call, and Camargo] at greater length. They are three wonderful men, and their very presence here this day is to me a testimony of the great power and the divinity of this work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/god-has-a-work-for-us-to-do.p4\" class=\"\">I love to read of the visit of Moroni to the boy Joseph Smith\u2014that night when he was only a youth, when a messenger clothed in white appeared before him in his bedroom. He was a farm boy, with very little in the way of formal education. But he had received a vision three years earlier, the like of which no man in his generation\u2014or in any generation since\u2014has received, when God the Eternal Father and the resurrected Lord had appeared to him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/god-has-a-work-for-us-to-do.p5\" class=\"\">Now the angel Moroni came, and according to the Prophet\u2019s testimony, \u201csaid unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30685\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30685)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30685)\">JS\u2014H 1:33<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/god-has-a-work-for-us-to-do.p6\" class=\"\">Brother Ringger comes from Switzerland. His grandmother was touched by the missionaries a long, long time ago. His father was a man of great faith, a patriarch in the midst of his people, in a very literal way. Brother Hans Ringger has been a stake president among his people and a Regional Representative. He is a man of faith. His English may not be as polished as perhaps yours is. But there burns in his heart a deep, flaming conviction of the truth of this work. By profession, he is a distinguished architect in his native land. He has just retired as a full colonel from the Swiss Army. When I talked with him the other day about his leaving his business and consecrating himself to the work of the Lord and what it would entail, I looked into his strong face, and the tears began to well just a little. Then he said, \u201cOf course, of course. If that\u2019s what the Lord wishes, that\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/god-has-a-work-for-us-to-do.p7\" class=\"\">It was so with Brother Call, who was born in Mexico and reared in Mexico\u2014in that land where the teaching of the gospel has been so fruitful, where there are now some three hundred thousand members of the Church who speak that beautiful language known as Spanish.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/god-has-a-work-for-us-to-do.p8\" class=\"\">It was so with Brother Camargo, who came within a few hours after I had talked with him on the phone\u2014just picked up his things and came, without ever a question, who speaks the tongue of Brazil\u2014Portuguese\u2014in that tremendous nation of South America.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/god-has-a-work-for-us-to-do.p9\" class=\"\">Three lands! \u201cGod had a work for me to do \u2026 my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues \u2026 it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.\u201d These are but representatives of this marvelous, miraculous thing, which we are witnessing in our time, of the spread of the restored gospel across the earth for the blessing of our Father\u2019s children wherever they may be found.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1985\/05\/god-has-a-work-for-us-to-do.p10\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, the time has come to conclude the conference.
