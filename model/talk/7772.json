Each sister is asked to seek out and help the poor and the needy among and around us. The \u201cpoor and the needy\u201d includes those with spiritual and emotional needs as well. Each one has also been charged to save our dead, which can be done by working on family history or by doing temple work. We have been commanded to share the gospel with others, and there are many ways to participate in missionary work. All of these things are ways we can serve the Lord. Our Heavenly Father expects those who are strong to strengthen the weak, and your own faith will be strengthened as you strengthen and care for His children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/steadfast-and-immovable.p61\" class=\"\">I know Heavenly Father loves each of His children perfectly, individually, and constantly. I know that, as women, we have an essential part in the plan of happiness. Our best effort is all He requires from us, and each of us is needed in building up the kingdom. The Atonement is real. Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer. I testify that if we are faithful and endure to the end, we will receive all of Heavenly Father\u2019s blessings, even eternal life and exaltation. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\"
