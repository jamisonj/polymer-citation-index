It is amazing to realize that in thousands of chapels throughout the world, others of you\u2014holders of the priesthood of God\u2014are receiving this broadcast by way of satellite transmission. Nationalities vary and languages are many, but a common thread binds us together. We have been entrusted to bear the priesthood and to act in the name of God. We are the recipients of a sacred trust. Much is expected of us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/a-royal-priesthood.p6\" class=\"\">We who hold the priesthood of God and honor it are among those who have been reserved for this special period in history.

If we were to apply that maxim to our lives, we could say that we are the result of many small decisions. In effect, we are the product of our choices. We must develop the capacity to recall the past, to evaluate the present, and to look into the future in order to accomplish in our lives what the Lord would have us do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/a-royal-priesthood.p10\" class=\"\">You young men holding the Aaronic Priesthood should have the ability to envision the day when you will hold the Melchizedek Priesthood and then prepare yourselves as deacons, as teachers, as priests to receive the holy Melchizedek Priesthood of God.

We must actually <span class=\"emphasis\">make<\/span> the effort. It\u2019s in the <span class=\"emphasis\">doing,<\/span> not just the <span class=\"emphasis\">thinking,<\/span> that we accomplish our goals. If we constantly put our goals off, we will never see them fulfilled. Someone put it this way: Live only for tomorrow, and you will have a lot of empty yesterdays today.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-00611_000_023\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Meredith Willson and Franklin Lacey, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Music Man<\/span> (1957).]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/a-royal-priesthood.p12\" class=\"\">In July of 1976, runner Garry Bjorklund was determined to qualify for the U.S. Olympic team\u2019s 10,000-meter race which would be run at the Montreal Olympics. Halfway through the grinding qualifying race, however, he lost his left shoe. What would you and I do if that were our experience? I suppose he could have given up and stopped. He could have blamed his bad luck and lost the opportunity of participating in the greatest race of his life, but this champion athlete did not do that. He ran on without his shoe. He knew that he would have to run faster than he had ever run in his life. He knew that his competitors now had an advantage that they did not have at the beginning of the race. Over that cinder track he ran, with one shoe on and one shoe off, finishing third and qualifying for the opportunity to participate in the race for the gold medal. His own running time was the best he had ever recorded. He put forth the effort necessary to achieve his goal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/a-royal-priesthood.p13\" class=\"\">As priesthood holders, we may find that there are times in our lives when we falter, when we become weary or fatigued, or when we suffer a disappointment or a heartache. When that happens, I would hope that we will persevere with even greater effort toward our goal.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/a-royal-priesthood.p14\" class=\"\">At one time or another each of us will be called to fill a position in the Church, whether as a deacons quorum president, a teachers quorum secretary, a priesthood adviser, a class teacher, a bishop. I could name more, but you get the picture. I was just 22 years of age when I was called to be the bishop of the Sixth-Seventh Ward in Salt Lake City. With 1,080 members in the ward, a great deal of effort was required to make certain that every matter which needed to be handled was taken care of and every member of the ward felt included and watched over. Although the assignment was monumental in scope, I did not let it overwhelm me. I went to work, as did others, and did all I could to serve. Each of us can do the same, regardless of the calling or assignment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/a-royal-priesthood.p15\" class=\"\">Just last year I decided to see how many residential dwellings were still standing from the period between 1950 and 1955 when I served as bishop of that same area. I drove slowly around each of the blocks that once comprised the ward. I was surprised to observe in my search that of all the houses and apartment buildings where our 1,080 members had lived, only three dwellings were still standing. At one of those houses, the grass was overgrown, the trees unpruned, and I found no one was living there. Of the other two houses remaining, one was boarded up and unoccupied, and the other housed some sort of a modest business office.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/11\/a-royal-priesthood.p16\" class=\"\">I parked my car, turned off the ignition, and just sat there for a long while. I could picture in my mind each house, each apartment building, each member who lived there. While the homes and the buildings were gone, the memories were still very vivid concerning the families who resided in each dwelling. I thought of the words of the author James Barrie, who wrote that God gave us memories that we might have June roses in the December of our lives.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-00611_000_023\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Laurence J.
