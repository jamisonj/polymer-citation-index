Now, fifty years later, our greatest responsibility and anxiety is to defend the divine mission of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, for all about us, even among those who claim to be professors of the Christian faith, are those not willing to stand squarely in defense of the great truth that our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, was indeed the Son of God.\u201d (Address to LDS Student Association Fireside, Utah State University, 10 Oct. 1971.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1990\/11\/witnesses-of-christ.p39\" class=\"\">Our knowledge of the literal divinity, resurrection, and atonement of Jesus Christ is more certain and more distinctive with each passing year.
