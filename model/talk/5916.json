It was entitled <span class=\"emphasis\">Field of Dreams<\/span> and was the story of a young man who revered the baseball players of his youth and, from this foundation, carved out a large section from his cornfield and located there a full-blown baseball diamond. People mocked his foolishness and ridiculed his lack of common sense. The film goes on to show the many challenges he faced in completing the project and readying the baseball diamond for view. His was not an easy task. During the period of doubt as to the future success of his dream, he was driven by the reassuring words, \u201cIf you build it, [they] will come.\u201d And come they did.

I think of the nearly 55,000 full-time missionaries from our faith who are assigned over much of the world with the divine commission to teach, to testify, and to baptize. Theirs is a bridge-building task, awesome to behold and somewhat overwhelming to contemplate. With God\u2019s mandate ringing in their ears, with the Lord\u2019s instruction penetrating their hearts, they move forward in their lofty callings.

Hinckley and his skillful participation in broad-ranging interviews, or just knowing another person who is a member and for whom respect exists. We, as members, should be at our best. Our lives should reflect the teachings of the gospel, and our hearts and voices ever be ready to share the truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/they-will-come.p18\" class=\"\">Fellowshipping of the investigator should begin well before baptism. The teachings of the missionaries often need the second witness of a new convert to the Church. It has been my experience that such a witness, borne from the heart of one who has undergone this mighty change himself, brings resolve and commitment. When I served as mission president in eastern Canada, we found that in Toronto, as well as in most of the cities of Ontario and Quebec, there was no dearth of willing helpers to accompany the missionaries and to fellowship the investigators, welcome them to meetings, and introduce them to the ward or branch officers and members. Fellowshipping, friendshipping, and reactivating are ongoing in the daily life of a Latter-day Saint.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/they-will-come.p19\" class=\"\">Each new convert should be provided a calling in the Church. Such brings interest, stability, and growth. The task may be somewhat simple, such as that given to Jacob de Jager when he and his family became members in Toronto. He held lofty posts in business, but his first calling in the Church was to put the hymnbooks in place along the pews. He took his assignment seriously. In recollecting this first calling, he said, \u201cI had to be present each week, or the hymnbooks would remain undistributed.\u201d As you know, Elder de Jager later served many years as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy. Though he had many demanding responsibilities as a General Authority, he never forgot his first calling in the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/they-will-come.p20\" class=\"\">The unseen hand of the Lord guides the efforts of those who strive to learn and live the truth of the gospel. As a mission president, I received a weekly letter from each missionary. One that pleased me greatly came from a young elder serving in Hamilton. He and his companion were working with a lovely family, a young couple with two children. The couple felt that the message was true, and they could not deny their desire to be baptized. The wife, however, worried about her mother and father in faraway western Canada, fearing she and her husband would be disowned by her parents for joining the Church. She took pen in hand and jotted a note to her parents in Vancouver. The note read something like this:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/they-will-come.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cDear Mother and Father,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/they-will-come.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cI want to thank you with all of my heart for your kindness and for your understanding and for the teachings which you gave me in my youth. John and I have come across a great truth, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We have studied the discussions, and our baptism will take place next Saturday night. We hope you will understand. In fact, we hope that you will welcome the missionaries in your home as we welcomed them in ours.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/they-will-come.p23\" class=\"\">The letter was sealed with a tear, a stamp was affixed, and it was mailed to Vancouver. On the very day it was received in Vancouver, the couple in Hamilton received a letter from the wife\u2019s mother and father. They wrote:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/they-will-come.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cWe are far away from you, or we would surely talk to you in person.

We have set a date for our baptism to take place next week. We hope you will understand and not be unduly critical of our decision. This gospel means so much to us and has brought such happiness into our lives that we pray someday you might also agree to learn more about it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/they-will-come.p25\" class=\"\">Can you imagine what happened when the couple in Hamilton received that letter from the wife\u2019s parents? They phoned Mother and Dad, and there were many tears of joy shed.

Some years ago, Sister Monson and I met with over 500 members there in a district conference. The presiding officer at that time was Leopoldo Larcher, a wonderful Italian. His brother had been working as a guest employee in the auto plants in Germany when two missionaries taught him the gospel. He went back to Italy and taught the gospel to his brother. Leopoldo accepted and sometime later became the president of the Italy Rome Mission and then the Italy Catania Mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/they-will-come.p28\" class=\"\">During that meeting, I noticed that in the throng were many who were wearing a white carnation.

Perhaps they were not fellowshiped; maybe friends departed from their lives. Whatever the reason, the fact remains: We need them, and they need us. Missionaries can effectively visit the homes where these individuals reside. When they approach, those within the shelter of home may come to remember the glorious feelings which came over them when they first heard the principles of the gospel taught to them. The missionaries can teach such individuals and witness the changes which come into their lives as they return to activity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/they-will-come.p32\" class=\"\">They need friends with testimonies.

When a leader walks the pathway of mortality with a precious youth alongside, there develops a bond of commitment between the two that shields the youth from the temptations of sin and keeps him or her walking steadfastly on the path that leads onward, upward, and unswervingly to eternal life.

During the appointment, President Clegg would mention the temple of the Lord, the saving ordinances and covenants emphasized there, and would conclude with this question: \u201cWouldn\u2019t you desire to take your sweet wife and your children to the house of the Lord, that you might be a forever family throughout all eternity?\u201d An acknowledgment followed, the reactivation process was pursued, and the goal was obtained.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/they-will-come.p37\" class=\"\">The other visit was to the North Carbon stake in Price, Utah, also many years ago.
