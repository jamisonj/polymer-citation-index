He was even a little fearful of giving a prayer in public. But this young man, according to his mission president, Wilford Cardon, became one of the very greatest missionaries imaginable. The president asked him toward the end of his mission how he had turned into such a dynamic, very successful missionary. (He had baptized more than two hundred people and had baptized every week for fifty-two consecutive weeks.) In a very humble manner Elder Malheiros answered, \u201cWell, president, I never doubted you. You said one could baptize every week, so I knew I could baptize every week. I never doubted.

He heard Elder Gordon B. Hinckley at a stake conference in Brazil, in which Elder Hinckley challenged the people to bring one hundred people into the Church that year. And so Brother Saraiva said, \u201cWhy not? If a member of the Twelve says it can be done, <span class=\"emphasis\">I will obey.<\/span>\u201d The last time I spoke with Brother Saraiva, he had baptized more than two hundred fifty people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/05\/obedience-full-obedience.p17\" class=\"\">Why is Floriano Oliveira, a member of the high council in a stake in Brazil, so successful as a missionary? Because he <span class=\"emphasis\">obeyed<\/span> the Lord\u2019s counsel to open his mouth and share the gospel. One day as he was driving through the congested traffic of S\u00e3o Paulo he took his eyes off the road for but a second and crashed into the car in front of him. He jumped out of the vehicle, hurried up to the car he had hit, opened the door and said, \u201cI am so sorry I hit you. It was all my fault. I accept the full blame and will pay the total costs. I had no intention to do this, so please forgive me. Yet if I hadn\u2019t hit you, you wouldn\u2019t have received this message I have for you, the message that you have waited for all your life.\u201d He then explained the restoration of the gospel to this man, who was a medical doctor, and the man joined the Church two weeks later.

The earth trembled and quaked, and the streams became raging torrents, and the mobbers dispersed, seeking shelter that could not be found.
