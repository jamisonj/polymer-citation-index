They were made by a modern-day pioneer, Brother Robert King, while he was serving as a missionary in Nauvoo. He was the first member of his family to join the Church, or so he thought. Brother King and his wife are currently serving as family history missionaries, and in the course of his research, he discovered that his great-grandfather Reed and his great-uncle Abraham joined the Church in 1835. But Reed was lost. He wandered down unknown paths, and the tender seedling of faith within him died.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/pioneer-shoes-through-the-ages.p10\" class=\"\">Such falling away concerns me. As I have traveled and met new converts, their eyes ablaze with the joy and peace their newfound faith has brought them, I have seen them make great sacrifices to join the fold. We must honor their sacrifice by loving them and strengthening them. My desire is to plead with our sisters to stop worrying about a phone call or a quarterly or monthly visit, and whether that will do, and concentrate instead on nurturing tender souls. Our responsibility is to see that the gospel flame continues to burn brightly. Our charge is to find the lost sheep and help them feel our Savior\u2019s love. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell says, \u201cIt is easier to find and to help \u2018the one\u2019 when the \u2018ninety and nine\u2019 are securely together.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-97911_000_007\">2<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Deposition of a Disciple<\/span> (1976), 35.

She felt that each sister should be asked to write a brief narrative of the first woman in her family to join the Church. The sisters then compiled their stories into a book, which I hold in my hand, entitled <span class=\"emphasis\">A Heritage of Sisterhood.<\/span> It is filled with stories of faith and commitment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/pioneer-shoes-through-the-ages.p18\" class=\"\">Sister Donna Packer, wife of President Boyd K.
