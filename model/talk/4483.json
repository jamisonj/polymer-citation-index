Lee gave a marvelous talk which he entitled <span class=\"emphasis\">A Leader\u2014The Champion of Youth<\/span> (Salt Lake City: Young Men\u2019s Mutual Improvement Association, 1968). Since having heard and read the talk, I would like not only to address my remarks to that subject but to qualify as champion of and for the youth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p4\" class=\"\">I recall the story of a teacher helping a young student on with his galoshes. They seemed smaller than his shoes. She got down on both knees and pushed, pulled, and stretched one boot until she finally got it on. Then she went through the same struggle and finally got the other one on. As she finally finished pulling it on, he said, \u201cThese are not my galoshes.\u201d The teacher pulled and struggled and finally got them off. Then he said, \u201cThey are my sister\u2019s, but my mother made me wear them.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p5\" class=\"\">Some who work with youth may feel that they do not \u201cfit\u201d the calling. It is not always comfortable to work with the youth, but for me, as God is my witness, I love them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p6\" class=\"\">At an encampment in Finland, the Scouts decided I should know how to sauna. Finns heat their saunas to 170 or 180 degrees. President Olli Roto, the stake president who was teaching me, along with the Scouts, who were experts, made a small bundle of birch branches. When we really began to perspire, he took the bundle of birch leaves and swatted me all over my back, chest, and legs, and said, \u201cThat brings the blood to the surface.\u201d I said, \u201cIt works.\u201d Then we ran down and dove into the Baltic Sea, then went back into the sauna. It\u2019s amazing what we learn when we\u2019re working with youth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p7\" class=\"\">Elder Orson F. Whitney said: \u201cYou parents of the wilful and the wayward! Don\u2019t give them up. Don\u2019t cast them off. They are not utterly lost. The Shepherd will find his sheep. They were his before they were yours\u2014long before he entrusted them to your care; and you cannot begin to love them as he loves them. They have but strayed in ignorance from the Path of Right, [but] God is merciful to ignorance. Only the fulness of knowledge brings the fulness of accountability. Our Heavenly Father is far more merciful, infinitely more charitable, than even the best of his servants, and the Everlasting Gospel is mightier in power to save than our narrow finite minds can comprehend\u201d (in Conference Report, Apr. 1929, p. 110).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p8\" class=\"\">Elder Lee in his talk referred to Horace Mann, who was \u201ccalled to dedicate a great school for boys. \u2026 he said, \u2018If this school costing all the millions that it has cost is able to save but one boy, it is worth all that it has cost.\u2019 One of his friends said to him after the meeting, \u2018You let your enthusiasm run away with you, didn\u2019t you? You don\u2019t mean that the millions we have spent here would be worth it all if we saved just one boy.\u2019 Horace Mann looked at him and replied, \u2018No, my friend, it wouldn\u2019t be too much to spend if that one boy were my son.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p9\" class=\"\">Then Elder Lee with great power and emotion said: \u201cI want to tell you it wouldn\u2019t be too much if that were one of my grandsons. They\u2019re precious to me and some of them are stubborn, hard-headed, and rascals just like their grandfather, hard to manage and difficult. If somebody, please, God, would just steer them past this dangerous age so that maybe they will find themselves like someone tried to help me when I was at that dangerous age, I would be most grateful\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">A Leader\u2014The Champion of Youth,<\/span> p. 3).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p10\" class=\"\">The youth of today are wonderful. Elder L. Tom Perry, the Utah South Area Presidency, and the Young Women presidency recently held meetings for all the seminary students in the Salt Lake area. In Salt Lake City, youth filled the Tabernacle, the Assembly Hall, and the Salt Palace auditorium, and 4,000 youth crowded the grounds of Temple Square and listened to the public address system. We had 23,000 young people in the Marriott Center at BYU, 3,200 at Dixie College, and over 3,000 at Snow College. The total count exceeded the number of seminary students enrolled by 5,000.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p11\" class=\"\">We invited this marvelous modern army of Israel to put on the armor of God, to stand for truth, and to become a marvelous, forceful influence against immorality, drugs, and indulgence. The response has been wonderful. The youth of the Church are one of the most powerful forces for good on the earth today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p12\" class=\"\">It is not difficult to understand why the great God in heaven has reserved these special spirits for the final work of the kingdom prior to his millennial reign.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p13\" class=\"\">My heart, like Enoch\u2019s, seems to swell \u201cwide as eternity\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39727\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39727)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39727)\">Moses 7:41<\/a><\/span>) as I consider what our youth and those being born in this time will accomplish. This generation will face trials and troubles that will exceed those of their pioneer forebears. Our generation has had some periods of respite from the foe. The future generation will have little or none. But their great faith in the Lord will give them needed strength.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p14\" class=\"\">Our youth influence their peer groups for good. President Wilford Woodruff said in a general conference in 1898, \u201cConcerning the work of the dead, the Prophet Joseph Smith said that in the resurrection those who had been worked for would fall at the feet of those who had done their work, kiss their feet, embrace their knees and manifest the most exquisite gratitude.\u201d I believe our youth will rescue an entire generation. Their work will bring these same feelings and emotions from parents and grandparents of those spiritually rescued.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p15\" class=\"\">I believe the promise of Ammon to his brethren applies to the youth today. In the 26th chapter of Alma we read: \u201cYea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cBut behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest, and they are his; and he will raise them up at the last day\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9596\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9596)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9596)\">Alma 26:6\u20137<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p17\" class=\"\">This is a chosen generation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p18\" class=\"\">Some time back, I was in Raymond, Alberta, Canada. Debbie, a beautiful teenage girl, spoke at stake conference. Among other things she said, \u201cI want to tell you about a friend I had when I went through high school.\u201d She said she felt homely but her friend told her she was beautiful. When there were dances, he would dance with her. He built her up. She said: \u201cHe was my very best friend. He was handsome and popular, and he lived his religion. I never heard him swear, he never violated the Word of Wisdom, and he faithfully went to church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cIt was a good thing that he was a strong member of the Church,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I tailed him everywhere he went. I did what he did, and I would have followed him anywhere. I cannot express the love and respect I have for him. I was not his girlfriend, but I sure loved him. He is on a mission now, and we write regularly. He still loves me and is still my best friend. He is my older brother.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p20\" class=\"\">What a blessing it is to the Church when brothers and sisters are filled with that kind of love and respect for each other!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p21\" class=\"\">In April 1945 Elder Harold B. Lee talked about our young men in the military. He said, \u201cI listened to a doctor recently who said that the medical journals reported that the boys who had become mentally unbalanced in large majority [in World War II], were the boys who had broken homes, whose wives or sweethearts had been unfaithful at home.\u201d Then he said this: \u201cWe have heard much in this conference about our boys. We have heard but little about our girls\u201d (in Conference Report, Apr. 1945, p. 165).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p22\" class=\"\">Thank God for great women like President Dwan Young and President Ardeth Kapp, who are great champions of youth. These are wonderful, noble, great women with vision and understanding.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p23\" class=\"\">Women are endowed with special traits and attributes that come trailing down through eternity from a divine mother. Young women have special God-given feelings about charity, love, and obedience. Coarseness and vulgarity are contrary to their natures. They have a modifying, softening influence on young men. Young women were not foreordained to do what priesthood holders do. Theirs is a sacred, God-given role, and the traits they received from heavenly mother are equally as important as those given to the young men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p24\" class=\"\">Sometimes misguided women or men direct our youth away from their divinely appointed role. Worlds without end, men will never be able to bear children. Every young woman may be a procreator with God and carry a little one under her breast either in this life or in the eternal worlds. Motherhood is a wonderful, priceless blessing, no matter what all the world may say. Priesthood ordination is a blessing to men. There are serious consequences when either motherhood or priesthood is abused or laid aside.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p25\" class=\"\">All of the prophets have been champions of youth, but I think our beloved prophet, President Ezra Taft Benson, stands at the pinnacle of those who love, defend, and champion our youth. Who will ever forget President Benson\u2019s marvelous recent counsel to the young men and the young women of the Church? Both of these talks have been distributed to the Church in pamphlet form (see <span class=\"emphasis\">To Young Men of the Priesthood,<\/span> pamphlet, 1986; <span class=\"emphasis\">To the Young Women of the Church,<\/span> pamphlet, 1986).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p26\" class=\"\">President Gordon B.

For tieing knots, yes. Knot tieing is Tenderfoot duty, but it is important. In one sense this whole business of living and doing is one of tieing knots, the kind of knots that will hold and not give under stress and strain. We see all around us the evidence of failure, of knots that slipped when they should have held. They are evident in career failures, in business failures, in professional failures, in marriage failures. To be able to tie the right knot for the right reason, for the right occasion, and to have it hold against every stress is a part of the process of being prepared\u201d (Boy Scouts Program, 10 Feb. 1985).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/11\/a-champion-of-youth.p28\" class=\"\">And President Thomas S.

A young counselor in the stake presidency, Thomas S. Monson, had just concluded speaking. The old patriarch in the stake stood up in the congregation and said, \u201cThomas Monson will sit in the Quorum of Twelve Apostles.\u201d Then he sat down. Indeed, Thomas Monson would and has.
