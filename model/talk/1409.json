It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or\nelse I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to\n'ask of God'\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30470\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30470)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30470)\">JS&mdash;H 1:11-13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo in accordance with his determination to ask of God, one beautiful spring morning in 1820\nhe retired to a grove of trees on his father's farm and knelt in prayer.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"My Beloved Son\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs he was praying he saw a pillar of light exactly over his head, above the brightness of the\nsun, which descended gradually until it fell upon him. When the light rested upon him, he\nsaw, standing above him in the air, two personages in the form of men, whose brightness and\nglory defied all description. One of them called Joseph Smith by name and said,\n\"<i>This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!<\/i>\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30473\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30473)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30473)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHe could see them as clearly as we see one another. And he could see that his own body was\ncreated in the image and likeness of God. At that time the churches taught that God was only\na spirit, that he had no body.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>He Is the Christ, Our Savior and Redeemer<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nYes, God does have a body, and he made us to be like him. I know this to be true: that God\nlives and that Jesus is our Savior and Redeemer.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the grove of trees that day, Joseph Smith asked the Savior which of all the sects was right\nand which he should join.\n<\/p><p>\nHe was told that he should join none of them, for they were all wrong, that they taught for\ndoctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness but denying the power\nthereof (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30474\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30474)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30474)\">JS&mdash;H 1:18-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis was a most startling message as it was an indictment of all churches in existence at that\ntime.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Vision Outstanding<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJoseph Smith's vision is probably the most outstanding in the history of God's relationship\nwith man. With the exception of Stephen's vision as described in the seventh chapter of Acts\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7983\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7983)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7983)\">Acts 7:55-56<\/a><\/span>),\nGod the Father has remained in the background&mdash;the Jehovah of the Old Testament being the\npreexistent Spirit of Jesus Christ, the Son of God the Father.\n<\/p><p>\nWith the opening of the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, it was entirely appropriate that\na fulness of the knowledge of God should be revealed to the Prophet. The importance of the\ndispensation was indicated by the Father introducing the Son to the Prophet Joseph. I bear\nyou my witness that Joseph Smith is indeed one of the great prophets of all time.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is difficult to appreciate the far-reaching effects of the Prophet's first vision&mdash;the first\ndirect revelation in modern times. Consider for a moment what it did.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Concept of the Godhead<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n<i>First<\/i>. It clarified the conception of the Godhead. It made it clear that God does have a body,\nparts, and passions. He appeared to Joseph Smith as a glorified man. This being so, man is in\nform the same as God. The scriptures taught that man was created in the likeness and image\nof God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23710\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23710)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23710)\">Gen. 1:26-27<\/a><\/span>),\nbut it took this vision to restore the correct conception of God.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Oneness of the Godhead<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Second<\/i>. It clarified the doctrine of the oneness of the Godhead. God the Father and his Son,\nJesus Christ, appeared as two separate and distinct Personages&mdash;as separate and distinct as\nany earthly father and son. This makes it clear that the oneness of the Godhead is a type of\nunity of mind and purpose.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Revelation Continues<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Third<\/i>. It proved that revelation from God to man had not ceased even though Christendom\ntaught otherwise.\n<\/p><p>\nThus this great vision restored to man the true concept of God, made known that there had\nbeen an apostasy from the doctrines of the Church of Christ, opened a new dispensation, and\nprovided a new witness for God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>He Will Reveal Many Great and Important Things<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn contemplating the knowledge that came to man through Joseph Smith's first vision, one\ncan more fully understand the meaning of the Ninth Article of Faith: \"We believe all that God\nhas revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great\nand important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6816\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6816)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6816)\">A of F 1:9<\/a><\/span>). Especially note the words, \"we\nbelieve that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Authority Restored<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn keeping with this belief and subsequent to the first vision, the Lord through his Prophet\nrestored the priesthood&mdash;the authority to act in the name of God&mdash;and authorized and\ndirected the reestablishment of his Church on the earth. Membership in the Church affords\nevery person a chance to serve&mdash;and service brings forth true happiness and peace together\nwith personal growth and development.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Gospel Restored<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThrough the prophets that have stood at the head of Christ's Church in this dispensation, the\ngospel in its fulness has been restored.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Book of Mormon and other modern revelations have brought increased knowledge and\nunderstanding, answering many vital questions such as. \"What is the purpose of life?\" \"Where\ndid we come from?\" \"Why are we here?\" \"Where do we go after death?\" \"What is our\nrelationship to God?\" \"How do we obtain happiness, peace, and progress eternally?\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe first vision of Joseph Smith clearly indicated the need of continuing revelation through a\nprophet. This need is likewise pressing today.\n<\/p><p>\nThe confused and frustrated condition of mankind is indicated in an article which recently\nappeared in a leading newspaper entitled: <i>Nation at Crossroads of Advancement or Fall<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Our progress, our genius, our productivity will go down in history. But where do we go from\nhere? We've taken to the worship of money and pleasure, twisted moral values to suit\nourselves, and scoffed at integrity. We have behaved like great civilizations of the past when\nthey've become pleasure-ridden&mdash;just before they crumbled.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Where do we go? What are our new goals? To some our goal is a simple one; we're rich,\nlet's get richer. We hear of three cars to a family, instead of two; four-day work weeks and\nthree days a week for amusement and indolence. It is questionable whether three cars will\nsave a family from divorce, or from spiritual emptiness, or from boredom.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Getting richer was yesterday's frontier. The new frontier is what logically follows the job of\nmaking a living. It is making a life. Finding new paths to family harmony, relatedness to God\nand fellow humans, inner ease instead of tensions. In other words&mdash;Peace.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Good Will Toward Men<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJesus was called the Prince of Peace, and at his coming the angels sang, \"Glory to God in the\nhighest, and on earth peace, good will toward men!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31643\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31643)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31643)\">Luke 2:14<\/a><\/span>).\nIt was God's wish that\neveryone would share this great gift of peace and good will.\n<\/p><p>\nPeace and joy characterize his kingdom according to the Apostle Paul, who declared: \"For the\nkingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy\nGhost\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42793\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42793)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42793)\">Rom. 14:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFamily harmony, the relief of inner tensions and genuine peace can be obtained by adhering\nto the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and by following the counsel and direction of\nGod's prophet.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Family and Home<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nRecently President McKay reemphasized the importance of the home and the role of parents\nin a program which is called, \"Teaching and living the gospel in the home.\" This program\nprovides for a weekly family night.\n<\/p><p>\nHe said, \"No other success can compensate for failure in the home,\" (The Improvement Era,\nJune 1964, p. 445) but promised that in those homes that followed the program, \". . . love at\nhome and obedience to parents will increase, and faith will develop in the hearts of the youth\nof Israel, and they will gain power to combat evil influences and temptations, and to choose\nrighteousness and peace, and be assured an eternal place in the family circle of our Father.\"\n(<i>Family Home Evening Manual<\/i>, preface.)\n<\/p><p>\nI call your attention again to the Ninth Article of Faith wherein it states, \". . . we believe that\n[God] will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6817\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6817)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6817)\">A of F 1:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Family Night program is an excellent example of this and an evidence of the need of\ncontinued revelation and a prophet to guide and direct us.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Testimony<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI testify in all solemnity that God has raised up a prophet today and that he is the head of The\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, President David O. McKay.\n<\/p><p>\nI urge all members of the Church to follow the counsel of this prophet, and to you who are\nnot members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but desire peace and relief\nfrom inner tensions, investigate the message that God has again spoken to men through a\nprophet. The Lord has restored the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness and reestablished his\nChurch with the power to act in the name of God.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear witness that these things are true; you, too, may know that they are true by earnestly\nstudying, praying, and attending the church services. We invite you to do so.\n<\/p><p>\nI leave this testimony with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
