I will never drink coffee, nor will I ever touch tea\u2014not because I can explain why I shouldn\u2019t, except that the Lord said not to.\u2019 He said those things were an abomination.

There were many temptations that came along, but I did not even analyze it; I did not stop and measure it and say, \u2018Well, shall I or shall I not?\u2019 I always said to myself: \u2018But I made up my mind I would not.
