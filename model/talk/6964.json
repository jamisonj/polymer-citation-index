One of those who was less active was a young man by the name of Fernando Araujo. Recently I spoke to Fernando, and he told me of his experience:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cI became involved in surfing competitions on Sunday mornings and stopped going to my Church meetings. One Sunday morning Brother Marques knocked on my door and asked my nonmember mother if he could talk to me. When she told him I was sleeping, he asked permission to wake me. He said to me, \u2018Fernando, you are late for church!\u2019 Not listening to my excuses, he took me to church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p7\" class=\"\">\u201cThe next Sunday the same thing happened, so on the third Sunday I decided to leave early to avoid him. As I opened the gate I found him sitting on his car, reading the scriptures. When he saw me he said, \u2018Good! You are up early. Today we will go and find another young man!\u2019 I appealed to my agency, but he said, \u2018We can talk about that later.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cAfter eight Sundays I could not get rid of him, so I decided to sleep at a friend\u2019s house. I was at the beach the next morning when I saw a man dressed in a suit and tie walking towards me. When I saw that it was Brother Marques, I ran into the water. All of a sudden, I felt someone\u2019s hand on my shoulder. It was Brother Marques, in water up to his chest! He took me by the hand and said, \u2018You are late! Let\u2019s go.\u2019 When I argued that I didn\u2019t have any clothes to wear, he replied, \u2018They are in the car.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cThat day as we walked out of the ocean, I was touched by Brother Marques\u2019s sincere love and worry for me. He truly understood the Savior\u2019s words: \u2018I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick\u2019 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43240\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43240)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43240)\">Ezek. 34:16<\/a><\/span>). Brother Marques didn\u2019t just give me a ride to church\u2014the quorum made sure I remained active.

We have a list of each one of our lost sheep. The quorum presidencies, advisers, and bishopric divide up and go visit them on a regular basis.

We discuss each young man in our quorum presidency meetings and in our monthly bishopric youth committee meetings. In 2003 we managed to rescue five priests, one teacher, and two deacons, who are now active in their quorums. We have also reactivated some families and have enjoyed the blessing of seeing some nonmembers enter the waters of baptism.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p14\" class=\"\">As I reflected on the desire of these priesthood brethren to fulfill their sacred duties, spending the bulk of their time ministering instead of administering, these words of the Savior came into my mind:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cFor I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cNaked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43283\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43283)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43283)\">Matt. 25:35\u201336<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p17\" class=\"\">The Savior\u2019s example of going the extra mile to find His lost sheep is evident throughout the scriptures. \u201cWhat man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine and go into the wilderness after that which is lost, until he find it?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43292\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43292)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43292)\">Joseph Smith Translation, Luke 15:4<\/a><\/span>).
