They are many, and\nthey keep pounding upon our thinking. President Clark enlarged upon the most important of\nthese problems. I would like to call your attention to one or two minor, though also\nimportant, problems, which are being much discussed at present. If it seems to be largely of a\ntemporal nature, my defense is that in the Gospel of Jesus Christ there is really no distinction\nbetween the temporal and the spiritual. Speaking to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I\ngiven unto you a law which was temporal\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11965\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11965)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11965)\">D&amp;C 29:34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHOUGHTS ON THE RETURN OF THE SOLDIERS\n<\/p><p>\nAt a recent stake conference, a fine young man, a soldier, enjoying a brief furlough, addressed\nthe congregation. He was clearly perplexed. He wondered why in the heat of battle, he had\nescaped the bullet that took the life of his buddy. He spoke of the interruption of his\neducation; the frustration of his life's plans; and the hell that we call war, into which he had\nbeen catapulted. He declared his readiness to die, if need be, for the freedom of man; but\nwondered why men should have to die to possess freedom, which belongs to every man by\nthe right of his existence. \"Shall this self-destruction of man continue?\" he asked. As he sat\ndown, he voiced the question now asked by millions of men: \"What of the future?\"\n<\/p><p>\nI thought of the 80,000 youths and young men of our faith, members of the Church, nearly all\nof whom will return, after the war, whole in body, but perhaps maimed in spirit, and scarred\nin memory, by the unnatural life in the army and navy, and by the inexpressible horrors of\nwarfare, as conducted by \"civilized\" man. They will return to a world which has been shaken\nand changed by the turmoil and tumult of battle in the air, on the land, and under the sea. It\nwill be a new world. They shall not see again the world they once knew. The forces of\nchange will have carved deep furrows in the face of human existence.\n<\/p><p>\nThese returning men were torn from their native soil by the roots. In the field of war, they\nhave been nurtured with the poison of destruction. How to transplant them, to revive their full\nvigor, and ensure normal growth after the war, is perhaps the major problem among the many\nthat will arise in the proposed reconstitution of the world.\n<\/p><p>\nHuman history does not justify the belief that returning armies will be adequately rehabilitated\nby governmental efforts. Grants of small sums of money, or the offering of opportunities to\nthe few, cannot restore that which has been lost, or supply the needs of the many who will\nneed help. That has been tried before, without success. Salvation by government, whether\nspiritual or temporal, before or after a war, is a delusive and elusive will-o'-the-wisp. With\nGod's help, men win success by self-effort, and only so.\n<\/p><p>\nDUTY TOWARDS THE DEFENDERS OF OUR COUNTRY\n<\/p><p>\nThe responsibility for our homecoming boys, who are really the coming generation, will rest,\nas in ages past, upon the family and the home and the cluster of neighborhood families and\nhomes. Each man must bear his own burden. Such help as he needs must be given by family\nand immediate friends. By such a distribution of a labor among many any task is easily\naccomplished, far beyond the power of any government. In every household we must convert\nour faith for peace, and our love for our boys, who have been willing to face death for us,\ninto sober planning and direct activity. We must sift the many possibilities for the benefit of\nthe returning lads. This duty, which we owe our defenders, cannot be shifted to others. Nor\ncan a central agency undertake it successfully. Moreover, that is ever the method of the\nGospel of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nNow is the time to undertake such planning and the consequent preparation. There should be\nno delay. We must be prepared. Building is slower than destruction. Our boys may soon be\ncoming home. They will then be ready for the next adventure. We must not reward their\nsacrifices with disappointment. Rather, we must be ready also with the necessary advice and\nhelp. It may be too late if we do not begin now.\n<\/p><p>\nIn this important matter, Latter-day Saints must needs cling to the well-established ideals of\nthe Church. Among them is one that we treasure greatly. We have the\nreputation of being a productive and creative people; and indeed we deserve it. We have\nalways tried to better the world, to leave it richer than we found it, spiritually and temporally.\nIn our temporal affairs we have taken the Lord at his word; that he has given man dominion\nover the earth, on the condition that he would seek to subdue it in the sweat of his brow. We\nhave proved this promise to be true; we know that only as we toil do we overcome obstacles.\nWe have learned also that whenever human energy is applied to the resources of earth, wealth\nis produced. That is indeed the only way that true wealth, much or little, can be added to the\nworld's possessions. By that method this people made a garden out of the desert; and by that\nmethod they have bettered their own economic conditions; and have led others into paths of\nprosperity. By that method every man may win wealth sufficient for his needs. It is the surest\napproach to a competence. We are a practical-minded people. Of that we are proud. This\nbasic principle should be before us in planning for our returning sons.\n<\/p><p>\nEDUCATION TO BE ENCOURAGED\n<\/p><p>\nIt is an equally well-established Latter-day Saint principle that ignorance waits on no man.\nDominion of the earth will ultimately be in the hands of those who know, and use their\npowers intelligently. Therefore, as a people we believe in education the gathering of\nknowledge and the training of the mind. The Church itself is really an educational institution.\nTraditionally, we are an education-loving people. Remember the valiant group, young and old,\nwho more than a hundred years ago gathered daily in upper rooms of the Kirtland Temple?\nThey were really the founders of adult education in the modern world. They dipped into\nEnglish, mathematics, history, science, law, and languages. They were fearless in their\neducational aspirations. They exemplified the words of Brigham Young, \"The religion\nembraced by the Latter-day Saints . . . prompts them to search diligently after knowledge.\"\nRemember, also, the succession of educational institutions marking the progressive history of\nthe Church! Schools, colleges, and universities attest the high place of education in \"Mormon\"\nphilosophy. Do not forget the surpassingly high present educational standing of our people.\n<\/p><p>\nOur young men returning from the front, should be encouraged to take up their educational\nwork where they laid it down when the country in its need called for their service; and they\nshould be urged to continue it to the end of their program. Despite the loss of time during the\nwar period, and the apparent financial need, they would make a mistake to rush into active\nlife without proper development and training; without the eye-and-mind-opening vistas that\nfollow the wise discipline of schools. The coming age will require the service of trained\nminds and bodies more than before. During the late financial depression, few men who had\nprofessions, including agriculture and the trades, were unemployed. The untrained group suffered most. We must see to it that our returning boys, even at our own heavy\nsacrifice, finish their educational ambitions. Thus we shall better protect their futures. Some\nhelp may be offered by the federal government. Schools will do their utmost, we may be sure,\nto intensify and shorten the courses required for men who have matured quickly among the\nstern realities of warfare.\n<\/p><p>\nEducation cultivates the innate powers of man, and gives him a vision of eternal truth and the\ngreat gains of the centuries. It should also help fit a person to make a living, and to perform\nbetter the work likely to be required of him, and from which he earns his bread and butter. In\nthat sense, all education, dealing with men, having earthly needs, should be practical.\nProbably most of our young men have already decided upon their life-pursuits; all should do\nso, and make their educational training subserve their life's needs. All their learning, including\nthat which seems at first remote, should fit into the student's life ambition. Wise parents, and\nall young men, will heed this matter with care; and direct their educational efforts to a\ndefinite objective. Wasted educational opportunities are seldom recovered.\n<\/p><p>\nAGRICULTURE GIVES PROMISE OF SUCCESS\n<\/p><p>\nAmong the membership of the Church, farmers and craftsmen predominate. They are true\nwealth producers, for they convert the elements about us into articles needed by man. By the\nefforts of these wealth producers, the prosperity of the world may best be measured.\nTherefore, the Church has always advocated that its members keep close to agriculture, the\ncrafts, and the industries. They form the safe base of the pyramid of social and economic life\non earth. More than a hundred years ago the Prophet Joseph Smith, then building the city of\nNauvoo, stressed this principle in no uncertain words.\n<\/p><p>\nProbably more than half of our Church membership is agricultural. Of that we are proud; for\nthat we are grateful; we hope that it may ever be so. Tillers of the soil are a steady,\ndependable element in society. There is an unusual stability in the lives of farmers and\nfarming communities. They know better than any other group that as we sow, so do we reap.\nThe succession of seed time and harvest bespeak to them an orderly universe. The changing\nseasons reveal powers beyond man's control, for which he must prepare in favorable years.\nBig lessons of life come out of the profession of farming. Seldom does a hare-brained social,\neconomical, or political philosophy issue from those who, upon the soil, face wind and\nweather for their sustenance. If the farmer is caught, for a time, by the oily promise and airy\nprospects of a fluent demagogue, he is usually the first to repent, often in sackcloth and ashes,\nand to return to a sensible, lawful order of living. A strong rural membership brings safety to\nthe Church not otherwise obtainable. It is so in the nation.\nWe believe in rural life. By that we mean not only living on a farm, but in a\nrural community, composed of farmers and the necessary craftsmen, tradesmen, and\nprofessional workers. If living joyfully is the purpose of life the small community, in which\nall modern advantages and comforts may now be available, has a distinct advantage over the\ncrowded city. Because of this, eminent business and professional men, operating in large\ncenters, often commute to their homes in rural neighborhoods. The present two chief\ncandidates for the office of president of the United States maintain their homes in rural\ncommunities. Already there is a strong movement towards the decentralization of industry, so\nthat workers may be placed in smaller communities, with the family kitchen garden and other\nsimilar advantages. The experiments of Henry Ford in the field of combining industry and\nagriculture are notable. \n<\/p><p>\nThe city of Zion, as laid out by the Prophet Joseph Smith, was planned to accommodate\nbetween 15,000 and 20,000 people&mdash;a relatively small city for the capital of a kingdom&mdash;the\nkingdom of God. The whole city was to be divided into twenty-four wards with six hundred\nto eight hundred souls in each ward. Each lot was to be four by twenty rods, ample for a\ndwelling house, outbuildings, and gardens. All public buildings would be placed in the easily\naccessible center of the city. Such a plan would be ideal in our day, if living richly is the\nconsideration. Indeed, we came near to this ideal in laying out our cities in the intermountain\ncountry. The Mormon village system has contributed much to our strength and our happiness\nas individuals and as a people. It is one of the many Mormon contributions to the plan for\nhuman welfare. It is interesting that many sound thinkers in our day are advocating similar\ncities and villages.\n<\/p><p>\nThe majority of the service men of the Church have come from the farm. They are acquainted\nwith rural conditions. It would be wise to encourage them to return to the farm. They would\nmake no mistake if they do so. Modern agriculture has become a profession of equal dignity\nwith the older, so-called, learned professions. It is good business, if practiced properly. It has\nthe unequaled power to yield daily, sane joy to the farmer and his family. And from\ngeneration to generation it builds men and women of strength for the world's service. If the\nfamily farm is too small to be divided, lands may yet be obtained. Such opportunities are\nusually known in every community. Communication with the agricultural committee of the\nwelfare program will reveal many localities where lands may be obtained under conditions\nthat may be met by our young men. Our western lands are far from being fully occupied.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE CONSERVATION OF WATER\n<\/p><p>\nBesides, in the irrigated area, where so many of our Church members live, the people have it\nwithin their own power, within their own locality to increase the area of tillable land. By\nconserving, and using more rationally, the water now available, the irrigated\narea may be greatly increased. Almost everywhere there is a great waste of water. The fallacy\nremains that the more water used the better it is for the plant. Over-irrigation follows. The\nfact is that the yield of a crop is completed with much less water than is usually applied.\nWater saved may be used to redeem more land of which there is a surplus in the West.\n<\/p><p>\nImmense quantities of water are lost by seepage. In one ideally located L.D.S. community,\nnearly one half of the water held in the reservoir is lost in transit over three or four miles to\nthe farms. The task of making this canal water-tight is slight compared with the labor of the\npioneers who settled that community and dug the first canals. There are also hundreds of\nplaces where water now going to waste might be stored, of spring water held back for later\ncrops. By a little united effort on the part of the people, such projects could more easily be\ncompleted than the pioneer projects of the founders of the West. Why wait for others to do it\nfor us? Let us do it ourselves!\n<\/p><p>\nIMPROVED CONDITIONS IN FARMING\n<\/p><p>\nIn addition, the introduction of new, more intensive, and more profitable crops, is increasing\nthe acre income on the farms, thus automatically enlarging the agricultural area. The relatively\nsmall farm, if cultivated properly, is the most satisfactory. There is yet land available for our\nyoung war veterans.\n<\/p><p>\nYou who may advise our lads to return to the farm should also remember that the profession\nof farming has moved forward with the vast progress of recent years. Much of the toil has\nbeen taken out of the tillage of the soil. Motorized implements, from plowing land to baling\nhay, even for the small farm, under control of one man, have cut down the former manual\nlabor. Only the other day I saw a farmer's son drive a herd of pure-bred, sleek, dairy cows to\nthe cooperative shed to be milked by machinery. When this herd was on its way back, another\ntook its place at the iron milk-maid. Such devices, helps to the farmer, are steadily increasing.\nThe farmer need no longer be kept busy from dawn to dark. Headwork is today the prime\nrequisite of the farmer. The day of the pioneer is not over. Progress is never ending, on the\nfarm as elsewhere. Problems beckon to every man of courage; and there is joy in conquest.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen we think of our boys who have gone out, willing to face death, if need be, for our\nfreedom, our hearts grow warm. They have a claim upon our help when they return to enter\nupon paths that will lead to service and joy. When we do our best and most for them we do\nnot do too much.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless us in this matter; and may He bless and protect our sons who are placed\nin battle array and guide them wisely upon their return. This I pray in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
