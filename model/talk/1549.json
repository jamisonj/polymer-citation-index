Romney, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1967, pp. 79-82<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy brothers and sisters, I have in mind speaking to you a few minutes this afternoon about a\nsubject that I myself have learned about through some rather severe experiences since the last\nconference. Therefore, if I am to do this effectively, I must have the Spirit of the Lord. I have\nsought it. I ask you now to join with me in asking the Lord to bless us while I occupy your\nvaluable time. The subject I have selected is \"peace in this world.\" I have taken my text from\nthe 59th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants: \n<\/p><p>\n<b>The works of righteousness bring peace . . . and eternal life<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this\nworld, and eternal life in the world to come\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14951\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14951)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14951)\">D&amp;C 59:23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis text promises two rewards: one in this world and another in the world to come.\nReference to \"the world to come\" brings to mind an incident that occurred in a divorce action\nwhen I was practicing law some 35 years ago. As the court was about to render its decision,\nthe plaintiff, a woman, requested and was granted a private conference. Nervously\napproaching the bench, she audibly whispered: \"Your honor, I want a divorce for this world\nonly, not for the world to come.\"\n<\/p><p>\nUnlike that judge, the Great Judge who spoke the words of our text has jurisdiction both in\nthis world and the world to come; although the promised rewards in the two are\ninterdependent, propose in these remarks to deal principally with peace in <i>this<\/i> world.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Peace<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFirst, let us agree upon the meaning of the word \"peace.\" \"Freedom from civil disturbance or\nwar\" is one dictionary definition. That this is not the \"peace\" promised, however, is evident\nfrom the fact that about the time the Lord spoke our text, he also said: \". . . the hour is not\nyet, but is nigh at hand, when peace [meaning freedom from civil disturbance or war] shall be\ntaken from the earth\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14902\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14902)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14902)\">D&amp;C 1:35<\/a><\/span>), and from the further fact that in 1894 and again in\n1896, President Woodruff, then the Lord's mouthpiece on the earth, indicated that the time for\nsuch peace to be taken from the earth had then come. (<i>Discourses of Wilford Woodruff<\/i>, pp.\n251-52.) Informed Latter-day Saints know that this earth will never again, during its telestial\nexistence, be free from civil disturbance and war.\n<\/p><p>\nNor does the \"peace\" of which we speak mean \"harmony in personal relations,\" another\ndictionary definition. Jesus made this plain when he said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her\nmother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35717\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35717)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35717)\">Matt. 10:34-35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJesus was, however, talking about the \"peace\" of which we speak when to his disciples he\nsaid: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.\nLet not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28357\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28357)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28357)\">John 14:27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHe was also talking about such \"peace\" when, just before he offered his intercessory prayer,\nhe concluded his instructions to his disciples with the words: \n<\/p><p>\n\"These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall\nhave tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28363\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28363)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28363)\">John 16:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFrom these scriptures it is apparent that the \"peace\" of our text is heaven-sent.\n<\/p><p>\nAmong those who enjoy it, of course, it brings \"harmony in personal relations.\" If men\ngenerally enjoyed it, it would banish civil disturbance and war. But in the absence of both\nmutual concord and civil peace, it may and does dwell in the hearts of many\npeople. The promise of it runs to each and every person who will qualify himself to receive\nit, regardless of the actions of those about him \". . . he who doeth the works of righteousness\nshall,\" says the Lord&mdash;not <i>may<\/i> or <i>can<\/i>, but <i>shall<\/i>&mdash;\"receive his reward, even peace in this\nworld, and eternal life in the world to come\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14952\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14952)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14952)\">D&amp;C 59:23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe revelation from which our text is taken not only extends to the Saints the comforting\npromise of peace in this world; it also specifies some of the specific works of righteousness\nupon which the promise is conditioned. The circumstances under which the revelation was\nreceived, as well as its content, are interesting and instructive.\n<\/p><p>\nDuring the summer of 1831, \"the mission to Western Missouri and the gathering of the Saints\nto that place was the most important subject which then engrossed the attention of the\nChurch.\" (<i>Documentary History of the Church<\/i>, Vol. 1, p. 182.) Those are the words of the\nProphet Joseph. Between the 19th of June and the middle of July the Prophet and his\nassociated traveled from Kirtland, Ohio, to Independence, Missouri. The Prophet himself\nwalked all the way from St. Louis to Independence, a distance of about 300 miles.\n<\/p><p>\nBetween the time of their arrival and the 7th of August, when the revelation was given, the\nColesville Branch arrived to join the few Saints who had preceded them. \"W. W. Phelps\npreached to a western audience.\" (<i>DHC<\/i>, Vol. 1, p. 190.) Several other revelations were\nreceived. \"The first log, for a house, as a foundation of Zion in Kaw township\" was laid.\n(<i>DHC<\/i>, Vol. 1, p. 196.) The site for the temple was revealed and dedicated, and the first\nconference in Zion was held.\n<\/p><p>\nInterest and enthusiasm among the people ran high. The Saints, having but recently arrived on\nthe scene, were all agog over the glorious predictions concerning latter-day Zion.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was under these circumstances, with the Saints perhaps a little over-anxiously anticipation\nZion as it shall be in its perfection and without fully appreciating the works of righteousness\nrequired to bring about the perfection, that the Lord said to them: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . blessed . . . are they who have come up unto this land with an eye single to my glory . .\n.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Yea, blessed are they whose feet stand upon the land of Zion, who have obeyed my gospel;\nfor . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . they shall . . . be crowned with blessings from above, yea, and with commandments not a\nfew, and with revelations in their time&mdash;they that are faithful and diligent before me.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, saying thus: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\nwith all thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength; and in the name of Jesus Christ thou\nshalt serve him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Thou shalt not steal; neither commit adultery, nor\nkill, nor do anything like unto it.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in righteousness, even that of a broken\nheart and a contrite spirit.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the\nhouse of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14947\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14947)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14947)\">D&amp;C 59:1,3-9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen after giving detailed instructions concerning observance of the Sabbath day, the Lord\nconcludes with this promise: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace\nin this world, and eternal life in the world to come\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14953\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14953)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14953)\">D&amp;C 59:23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn this manner did the Lord relate the rewards to specific works and urged the Saints to learn\nfor themselves that peace in this world comes as a reward for works of righteousness.\n<\/p><p>\nPeace in this world, being an inner feeling, is difficult to define. It may, therefore, perhaps be\nbest understood through illustrations. You who are familiar with the Book of Mormon will\nrecall the experiences of Enos, who, in the true spirit of repentance, sought forgiveness of sins\nwith such persistent faith and prayer that \"there came a voice unto [him,] saying: Enos,\nthy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.\" Whereupon Enos\nwrote: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I . . . knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt was swept away.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I said: Lord, how is it done?\n<\/p><p>\n\"And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ . . . wherefore, go to, thy faith hath\nmade thee whole\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21497\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21497)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21497)\">Enos 1:6-8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThereafter Enos besought the Lord into preserve a record, \". . . that it might be brought forth\nat some future day unto the Lamanites . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . and he covenanted with me [wrote Enos] that he would bring them forth unto the\nLamanites in his own due time.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I, Enos, knew it would be according to the covenant which he had made; wherefore my\nsoul did rest\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21498\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21498)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21498)\">Enos 1:13,16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nContributing to the peace and rest that filled the soul of Enos was the accompanying\nassurance of eternal life in the world to come that accompanied it. This he thus expressed: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I soon go to the place of my rest, which is with my Redeemer; for I know that in him I\nshall rest. And I rejoice in the day when my mortal shall put on immortality, and shall stand\nbefore him; then shall I see his face with pleasure, and he will say unto me: Come unto me,\nye blessed, there is a place prepared for you in the mansions of my Father. Amen\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21499\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21499)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21499)\">Enos 1:27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAt times numerous persons have sought and obtained this feeling of peace at the same time.\nRecorded in the first chapters of Mosiah is a powerful message received by King Benjamin\nfrom an angel of the Lord (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40353\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40353)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40353)\">Mosiah 3:2<\/a><\/span>) and delivered by him to his subjects. The message concerned the\natonement of Christ, by means of which men, through faith and repentance, may obtain\nforgiveness of sins, which forgiveness heals the spirit and thus brings peace to the soul.\nHaving delivered the message, Benjamin \"cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and\nbehold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning\nblood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified;\nfor we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon\nthem, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having\npeace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40357\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40357)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40357)\">Mosiah 4:1-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnother dramatic example of a community experiencing peace in a world of tribulation\nconcerns the people of Alma, who had covenanted with the Lord in the waters of Mormon\nand who were later brought into bondage by Amulon, who \"put tasks upon them, and put\ntaskmasters over them.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And . . . so great were their afflictions that they began to cry mightily to God.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And Amulon commanded them that they should stop their cries; and he put guards over them\nto watch them, that whosoever should be found calling upon God should be put to death.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but did pour out\ntheir hearts to him . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, saying: Lift\nup your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto\nme . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I will . . . ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot\nfeel them upon your backs . . . while you are in bondage . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were\nmade light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease\n. . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"And it came to pass that so great was their faith and their patience that the voice of the Lord\ncame unto them again, saying: Be of good comfort, for on the morrow I will deliver you out\nof bondage\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40360\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40360)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40360)\">Mosiah 24:9-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThese illustrations are but samples of the many to be found in the scriptures. But each of\nthem, as do the others, evidences the truth of our text that peace in this world always comes\nafter the receiver has done the works of righteousness. Enos, the subjects of King Benjamin,\nand the people of Alma had all demonstrated, by good works, their faith in Christ before the\nreward came. This is the way peace comes in this world. It can be obtained in no other way.\nThe promised peace of our text emanates from Christ. He is the source of it. His spirit is the\nessence of it.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear you my witness that I know that you and I may enjoy the promised \"peace in this\nworld\" and the assurance of \"eternal life in the world to come\" on the prescribed terms\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14954\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14954)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14954)\">D&amp;C 59:23<\/a><\/span>). Only\nthose who experience such peace and assurance can appreciate how they come and the joy\nthey bring. The thought of them, however, is associated in my mind with two scriptures. First,\nfrom the account Nephi gives of his experience on the mount with the Spirit of the Lord, who\nsaid to him: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I answered him . . . Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the\nhearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the soul\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1642\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1642)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1642)\">1 Ne. 11:21-23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, such joy and peace does not come from knowing about Deity; it comes from the\nknowledge implied by Jesus when, thanking his Father for the power to give eternal life to his\nfollowers, he said: \"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and\nJesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28367\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28367)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28367)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, my beloved brothers and sisters, that you may get your sights on coming to\nknow God, the Eternal Father, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent: not just to talk about them,\nbut a personal acquaintance with them. When you get such a knowledge, you will have \"peace\nin this world\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14955\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14955)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14955)\">D&amp;C 59:23<\/a><\/span>). In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
