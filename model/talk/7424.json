I discovered she was the only member of the Church in her high school. I asked her, \u201cWhat is the most difficult challenge you face being the only member?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p6\" class=\"\">She was thoughtful and gave a very astute answer: \u201cIt is believing something is true when everyone else believes it is false, and believing something is wrong when everyone else believes it\u2019s all right.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p7\" class=\"\">I asked her a second question: \u201cDo you know Joseph Smith is a prophet of God?\u201d Her response was, \u201cI think so, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p8\" class=\"\">This morning I would like to ask the youth throughout the Church, \u201cDo you know?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p9\" class=\"\">The first time I knew I had a testimony of Joseph Smith was when I was just 11 years old and my parents took me to Temple Square in Salt Lake City.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p10\" class=\"\">My favorite activity was to collect all the free stuff. I became very adept at working the system. I would ask, \u201cIs this free?\u201d After a positive response I would reach out my 11-year-old hand and say, \u201cThank you. Is that free too? Thank you!\u201d On occasion someone might say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry; those cost five cents.\u201d Undeterred, I would lower my head and, showing much disappointment, say, \u201cOh, I always wanted to read that pamphlet, but I don\u2019t have any money. Thank you!\u201d It worked every time. The truth is, I never read it. I just collected it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p11\" class=\"\">However, on this particular trip, I was alone in our 1948 Chevrolet, waiting for my parents, when I became inescapably bored. In desperation I looked down at the seat and spotted my stack of free stuff. I picked up a pamphlet entitled <span class=\"emphasis\">Joseph Smith Tells His Own Story<\/span> and began to read it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p12\" class=\"\">I was riveted, and my heart was filled with joy. After completing it, I caught my reflection in the rearview mirror, and much to my surprise, I was crying. I didn\u2019t understand then, but I understand now. I had felt a witness of the Spirit. My parents weren\u2019t there. My sister wasn\u2019t there. My Primary teacher wasn\u2019t there. It was just me and the Spirit of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p13\" class=\"\">Now, this can happen to you, and something similar probably already has.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p14\" class=\"\">When seeking a testimony, those of you born into the Church may be looking for some spectacular spiritual feeling different than anything you have ever felt before. You may have heard converts testify of their conversion and wonder if you\u2019re missing something. One reason it seems so spectacular to them is that it is new.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p15\" class=\"\">You have had the same feelings your whole life during family home evenings, youth testimony meetings, seminary classes, scripture reading, and on many other occasions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p16\" class=\"\">Our missionaries are trained to help investigators recognize when they are feeling the Spirit. I remember on numerous occasions stopping in the middle of an intense, spiritual discussion and saying, \u201cLet\u2019s pause for a moment and talk about what you are feeling right now. You\u2019re feeling like we\u2019ve reminded you of things you had forgotten. You\u2019re feeling that we are telling you the truth. You\u2019re feeling peace. You\u2019re feeling the Holy Ghost.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p17\" class=\"\">I remember teaching an extremely intelligent woman who had a hard time accepting anything until she had nailed down every intellectual loose end. However, at long last we heard her say, \u201cI cannot deny this feeling any longer.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p18\" class=\"\">She joined the Church and was very happy for the next few years, but she gradually let her intellectual doubts creep back in and ultimately left the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p19\" class=\"\">Fifteen years went by, and she came to visit our family. We took her to Temple Square. As we started up the circular ramp leading to the statue of the Savior, she paused and tearfully said, \u201cHere comes that feeling again. My heart still yearns for what my mind won\u2019t accept!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p20\" class=\"\">Once you have felt it, you can never forget it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p21\" class=\"\">Spiritual witnesses come at a young age to those who are exposed to spiritual experiences. As parents, teachers, and leaders, we are good at making certain you understand the rules and commandments. We could improve on helping you gain a testimony of the principles and doctrine. Perhaps we could pause more often and help you learn to recognize the Spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p22\" class=\"\">Once you recognize those feelings for what they are, your faith in them will increase. Soon you will find that you have developed a spiritual sixth sense which cannot be misled.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p23\" class=\"\">At 11 years of age, I knew Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I didn\u2019t hear voices, see angels, or anything like that. What I felt was much more certain. My spiritual sense had been touched. I felt elation springing forth from the innermost part of my being, which is protected from all deceit. This spiritual sense vibrates only when activated by the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p24\" class=\"\">How does this spiritual witness feel? It is as difficult to describe as the scent of a rose or the song of a bird or the beauty of a landscape. Nevertheless, you know it when you feel it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p25\" class=\"\">The scriptures give us some insights into these feelings:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy; and then shall ye know\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50392\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50392)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50392)\">D&amp;C 11:13\u201314<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p27\" class=\"\">Sometimes the feeling is like a memory. We first learned the gospel in our heavenly home. We have come to this earth with a veil of forgetfulness. And yet lingering in each of our spirits are those dormant memories. The Holy Ghost can part the veil and bring those things out of their dormancy. Often my reaction to a supposedly newfound truth is, \u201cOh, I remember that!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cThe Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost \u2026 [will] bring all things to your remembrance\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50190\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50190)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50190)\">John 14:26<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/do-you-know.p29\" class=\"\">My young brothers and sisters, I invite you to \u201cexperiment upon my words\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"50301\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 50301)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(50301)\">Alma 32:27<\/a><\/span>).
