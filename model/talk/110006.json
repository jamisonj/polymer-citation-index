Some have an understanding of what they commit to the keeping of their memories, while others commit to repeat again, and that is the end of it. Some can remember things for years that have been told them, and still not understand what was told them; while others can receive more into their understandings, and retain more in their memories, than others can, and still not be qualified to repeat that which they can remember and understand. Why I make these remarks is, because that I see around me, and feel within me, the defects which are occasioned by the <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"39b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD11\/JoD11_0039.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;39b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/4720\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> weakness which is in man through the fall.

This is a very solemn ordinance. The Christian world accepts it, in preference to any other, as one of the ordinances of the house of God. With some, this ordinance is the first and the last; and with others this ordinance is not  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"40a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD11\/JoD11_0040.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;40a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/4719\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>thought to be of sufficient importance to be attended to. I wish to say to the Latter-day Saints, and also to those who do not believe in the fulness of the Gospel, that this ordinance, which we are now attending to this afternoon, is, in reality, no more sacred than any other ordinance of the house of God in the eyes of Him who has instituted the same. The validity of one divine law is the same as the validity of another with our Father and God. We partake of bread and water to witness that we remember Jesus Christ,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"82783\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 82783)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(82783)\">3 Ne. 18:11<\/a><\/span> who gave his life a ransom for us,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"66629\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 66629)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(66629)\">Mark 10:45<\/a><\/span> and that we are willing to keep His commandments.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"84411\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 84411)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(84411)\">D&amp;C 20:77<\/a><\/span> He has said, &#x201C;Do this in remembrance of me,&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"68065\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 68065)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(68065)\">Luke 22:19<\/a><\/span> when He ate His last supper with His disciples; and He also said, &#x201C;But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"66236\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 66236)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(66236)\">Matt. 26:29<\/a><\/span> We should desire to remember Him in all sincerity, and when we partake of these emblems, do it with an eye single to His glory, and to the building up of His kingdom, also for our own perfection, salvation, and glorification therein.

I pray that the Latter-day Saints will live so that God, Jesus Christ, and the angels will love them, and the devil and all his hosts will hate them. I have never yet been able to discover in all my researches in sacred history that a Gospel hater, a Jesus Christ hater, and a God hater ever spoke well of Saints, either in the former or in the latter days, but have ever sought occasion against them from the most trifling circumstances.

It is true, some will backslide, leave the Church of Jesus Christ, and receive the spirit of the world and the love of it, and, finally, be lost; but the great body of the Saints, I most fervently believe, will never amalgamate with Baal. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v11n132\"> I will now say a few words relating to the subject which was presented to the people this morning. Inquiries were made by the speaker, why we have not seen God; why we are subject to sin; why we are in this fallen world? I will briefly answer these queries. If our Father and God should be disposed to walk through one of these aisles, we should not know him from one of the congregation. You would see a man, and that is all you would know about him; you would merely know Him as a stranger from some neighboring city or country. This is the character of Him whom we worship and acknowledge as our Father and God: when He is disposed to visit a house, a neighborhood, or a congregation, He does it at His pleasure; and although He may be seen by mortals in this character, yet no man can see Him in His glory and live.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"54536\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 54536)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(54536)\">Ex. 33:20<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"125555\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 125555)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(125555)\">Ex. 33:20 (JST)<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"68609\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 68609)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(68609)\">John 1:18<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"92238\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 92238)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(92238)\">Moses 1:5<\/a><\/span> When the Lord sends an angel to visit men, He gives him power and authority to appear to the people as a man, and not as an angel in his glory; for we could not  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"41a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD11\/JoD11_0041.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;41a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/4718\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>endure the presence even of an angel in his glory.

We have no testimony concerning the Savior's character and works, only from those who were thus interested in His welfare and success, and in the building up of His kingdom. It has been often said, if a disinterested witness would testify that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, many might believe his testimony; but no person could be believed, by any intelligent person, who would testify to a matter of such importance, and who would still view it as a thing in which he had no interest. But they who are interested, who know the worth of that man and understand the spirit and the power of his mission, and the character of the Being that sent and ordained him, are the proper persons to testify of the truth of his mission, and they are the most interested of any living upon the earth.

Although mankind of the same color look alike, yet there exist expressions of the features by which one person can be distinguished from another. The human family all resemble one another in the main characteristics of humanity, and all resemble the Savior who died for us; and could we see him in the flesh, as he appeared to the ancients, we should very likely find that some men are more like him than others in feature and form, as we often see men who are more like Joseph Smith than others are. God is our Father, Jesus Christ is our Elder Brother, and we are all brethren, and of one family, and our Heavenly Father is subjecting us to sin, misery, pain, and death for the exquisite enjoyment of an exaltation. This will answer my mind for the present with regard to the character of our Father and our God, and with regard to our Savior. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v11n138\"> The reason of our being made subject to sin and misery, pain, woe, and death, is, that we may become acquainted with the opposites of happiness and pleasure. The absence of light brings darkness, and darkness an appreciation of light; pain an appreciation of ease and comfort; and ignorance, falsehood, folly, and sin, in comparison with wisdom, knowledge, righteousness, and truth, make the latter the more desirable to mankind. Facts are made apparent to the human mind by their opposites. We find ourselves surrounded in this mortality by an almost endless combination of opposites, through which we must pass to gain experience and information to fit us for an eternal progression. Those who are enlightened by the spirit of truth, have no difficulty in seeing the propriety and the benefit to us of this state of things. Like heavenly beings, we are endowed with the power of free volition; for God has given to mankind their agency,  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"43a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD11\/JoD11_0043.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;43a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/4716\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>making them amenable to him for their sins, and entitling them to blessings and rewards for the good they do, and according to their faith in him. It is the wish of our Heavenly Father to bring all his children back into his presence. The spirits of all the human family dwelt with him before they took tabernacles of flesh and became subject to the fall and to sin. He is their spiritual Father, and has sent them here to be clothed with flesh, and to be subject, with their tabernacles, to the ills that afflict fallen humanity. When they have proved themselves faithful in all things, and worthy before Him, they can then have the privilege of returning again to his presence, with their bodies, to dwell in the abodes of the blessed. If man could have been made perfect, in his double capacity of body and spirit, without passing through the ordeals of mortality, there would have been no necessity of our coming into this state of trial and suffering. Could the Lord have glorified his children in spirit, without a body like his own, he no doubt would have done so. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v11n140\"> We read that there is nothing impossible with God.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"66998\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 66998)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(66998)\">Luke 1:37<\/a><\/span> In a broad sense there is not; but in another sense there are things he never attempted and never will.

The spirit must be clothed as He is, or it never can be glorified with him. He must of necessity subject his children to the same, through a strict observance of the ordinances and rules of salvation.

The riches of eternity and the marrow of life are embraced in them; they are full of life to all who desire life, they will increase life to those who live, and give life to those who seem to have no life. It is as easy to understand these principles when the mind is opened by the Spirit of the Almighty, as it is to understand one of the simple lessons in the child's first reader. Here are some of the twelve apostles listening to what I have to say; they have heard me speak at length upon these doctrines, and they have been taught from time to time for years past. The speaker this morning possessed a sweet, loving spirit, and gave us a lovely discourse, but did not think of these things which have been told him time and time again. I would exhort my brethren to read the Scriptures, and seek earnestly for the Spirit of the Almighty to understand them; and this great subject, at which I have merely glanced, will appear to them in all its simplicity and grandeur. Let each man so live that he may know these things for himself, and be always ready to give a reason of the hope within him to all who may ask it.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"77909\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 77909)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(77909)\">1 Pet. 3:15<\/a><\/span> I am trying to be a Latter-day Saint, and I think I shall conquer.

Let us live so that the oracles of truth, the words of life, and the power of God shall dwell within us constantly.

This we cannot help. Let the pure in heart, and all those who desire the truth, magnify their calling, and they will have all the sorrow and misery they want. Still, the faithful servants and handmaidens of the Almighty never have, nor never will, suffer like the wicked have and will. The Latter-day Saints, in all their drivings, and persecutions, and sufferings in consequence thereof, have not begun to suffer the distress, the heart wringing, the great woe and slaughter that now spread gloom over our once happy land. If we could behold at one glance the suffering that is endured in one day through the war which is now depopulating some of the fairest portions of the land, we should become sick at heart and cry to God to close the vision. It is the kingdom of God or nothing with us, and by the help of the Almighty we shall bear it off triumphantly to all nations, gather Israel, build up Zion, redeem Israel, and Jesus Christ will triumph, and we shall reign with him on the earth, and possess it and all its fulness with him. May the Lord bless you. Amen. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
