Like the mule who entered the Kentucky Derby, I know I probably shouldn\u2019t be here, but I surely like the company it lets me keep. Tonight I include in that special company my son Matt, whom I love with all my heart. I pray earnestly for the Spirit of the Lord to be with us in our assignment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p4\" class=\"\">Brethren, a recent study conducted by the Church has forcefully confirmed statistically what we have been told again and again. That is, if loving, inspired instruction and example are not provided at home, then our related efforts for success in and around Church programs are severely limited. It is increasingly clear that we must teach the gospel to our families personally, live those teachings in our homes, or run the risk of discovering too late that a Primary teacher or priesthood adviser or seminary instructor <span class=\"emphasis\">could<\/span> not do for our children what we <span class=\"emphasis\">would<\/span> not do for them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p5\" class=\"\">May I offer just this much encouragement regarding such a great responsibility? What I cherish in my relationship with Matt is that he is, along with his mother and sister and brother, my closest, dearest friend. I would rather be here at this priesthood meeting tonight with my son than with any other male companion in this world. I love to be with him. We talk a lot. We laugh a lot. We play one-on-one basketball; we play tennis and racquetball, though I do refuse to play golf with him (that\u2019s a private joke). We discuss problems. I am the president of a small university, and he is the president of a large high school class. We compare notes and offer suggestions and share each other\u2019s challenges. I pray for him and have cried with him, and I\u2019m immensely proud of him. We\u2019ve talked long into the night lying on his water bed, a twentieth-century aberration which I know, as part of the punishment of the last days, will one day burst and wash the Hollands helplessly into the streets of Provo (that\u2019s another private joke).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p6\" class=\"\">I feel I can talk to Matt about how he is enjoying seminary because I try to talk to him about all of his classes at school. We often imagine together what his mission will be like because he knows how much my mission meant to me. And he asks me about temple marriage because he knows I am absolutely crazy about his mother. He wants his future wife to be like her and for them to have what we have.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p7\" class=\"\">Now, even as I speak, I know that there are fathers and sons in this meeting tonight who feel they do not have any portion of what is here described. I know there are fathers who would give virtually their very lives to be close again to a struggling son. I know there are sons in our meeting who wish their dads were at their side, tonight or any night. I have wondered how to speak on this assigned topic without sounding self-righteous on the one hand or offending already tender hearts on the other. In answer to that, I simply say to us all, young and old, never give up. Keep trying, keep reaching, keep talking, keep praying\u2014but never give up. Above all, never pull away from each other.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p8\" class=\"\">May I share a brief but painful moment from my own inadequate efforts as a father?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p9\" class=\"\">Early in our married life my young family and I were laboring through graduate school at a university in New England. Pat was the Relief Society president in our ward, and I was serving in our stake presidency. I was going to school full-time and teaching half-time. We had two small children then, with little money and lots of pressures. In fact, our life was about like yours.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p10\" class=\"\">One evening I came home from long hours at school, feeling the proverbial weight of the world on my shoulders. Everything seemed to be especially demanding and discouraging and dark. I wondered if the dawn would ever come. Then, as I walked into our small student apartment, there was an unusual silence in the room.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble?\u201d I asked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cMatthew has something he wants to tell you,\u201d Pat said.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cMatt, what do you have to tell me?\u201d He was quietly playing with his toys in the corner of the room, trying very hard not to hear me. \u201cMatt,\u201d I said a little louder, \u201cdo you have something to tell me?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p14\" class=\"\">He stopped playing, but for a moment didn\u2019t look up. Then these two enormous, tear-filled brown eyes turned toward me, and with the pain only a five-year-old can know, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mind Mommy tonight, and I spoke back to her.\u201d With that he burst into tears, and his entire little body shook with grief. A childish indiscretion had been noted, a painful confession had been offered, the growth of a five-year-old was continuing, and loving reconciliation could have been wonderfully underway.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p15\" class=\"\">Everything might have been just terrific\u2014except for me. If you can imagine such an idiotic thing, I lost my temper. It wasn\u2019t that I lost it with Matt\u2014it was with a hundred and one other things on my mind; but he didn\u2019t know that, and I wasn\u2019t disciplined enough to admit it. He got the whole load of bricks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p16\" class=\"\">I told him how disappointed I was and how much more I thought I could have expected from him. I sounded like the parental pygmy I was. Then I did what I had never done before in his life\u2014I told him that he was to go straight to bed and that I would not be in to say his prayers with him or to tell him a bedtime story. Muffling his sobs, he obediently went to his bedside, where he knelt\u2014alone\u2014to say his prayers. Then he stained his little pillow with tears his father should have been wiping away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p17\" class=\"\">If you think the silence upon my arrival was heavy, you should have felt it now. Pat did not say a word. She didn\u2019t have to. I felt terrible!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p18\" class=\"\">Later, as we knelt by our own bed, my feeble prayer for blessings upon my family fell back on my ears with a horrible, hollow ring. I wanted to get up off my knees right then and go to Matt and ask his forgiveness, but he was long since peacefully asleep.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p19\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">My<\/span> relief was not so soon coming; but finally I fell asleep and began to dream, which I seldom do. I dreamed Matt and I were packing two cars for a move. For some reason his mother and baby sister were not present. As we finished I turned to him and said, \u201cOkay, Matt, you drive one car and I\u2019ll drive the other.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p20\" class=\"\">This five-year-old very obediently crawled up on the seat and tried to grasp the massive steering wheel. I walked over to the other car and started the motor. As I began to pull away, I looked to see how my son was doing. He was trying\u2014oh, how he was trying. He tried to reach the pedals, but he couldn\u2019t. He was also turning knobs and pushing buttons, trying to start the motor. He could scarcely be seen over the dashboard, but there staring out at me again were those same immense, tear-filled, beautiful brown eyes. As I pulled away, he cried out, \u201cDaddy, don\u2019t leave me. I don\u2019t know how to do it. I am too little.\u201d And I drove away.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p21\" class=\"\">A short time later, driving down that desert road in my dream, I suddenly realized in one stark, horrifying moment what I had done. I slammed my car to a stop, threw open the door, and started to run as fast as I could. I left car, keys, belongings, and all\u2014and I ran. The pavement was so hot it burned my feet, and tears blinded my straining effort to see this child somewhere on the horizon. I kept running, praying, pleading to be forgiven and to find my boy safe and secure.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p22\" class=\"\">As I rounded a curve nearly ready to drop from physical and emotional exhaustion, I saw the unfamiliar car I had left Matt to drive. It was pulled carefully off to the side of the road, and he was laughing and playing nearby. An older man was with him, playing and responding to his games. Matt saw me and cried out something like, \u201cHi, Dad. We\u2019re having fun.\u201d Obviously he had already forgiven and forgotten my terrible transgression against him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p23\" class=\"\">But I dreaded the older man\u2019s gaze, which followed my every move. I tried to say \u201cThank you,\u201d but his eyes were filled with sorrow and disappointment. I muttered an awkward apology and the stranger said simply, \u201cYou should not have left him alone to do this difficult thing. It would not have been asked of you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p24\" class=\"\">With that, the dream ended, and I shot upright in bed. <span class=\"emphasis\">My<\/span> pillow was now stained, whether with perspiration or tears I do not know. I threw off the covers and ran to the little metal camp cot that was my son\u2019s bed. There on my knees and through my tears I cradled him in my arms and spoke to him while he slept. I told him that every dad makes mistakes but that they don\u2019t mean to. I told him it wasn\u2019t his fault I had had a bad day. I told him that when boys are five or fifteen, dads sometimes forget and think they are fifty. I told him that I wanted him to be a small boy for a long, long time, because all too soon he would grow up and be a man and wouldn\u2019t be playing on the floor with his toys when I came home. I told him that I loved him and his mother and his sister more than anything in the world and that whatever challenges we had in life we would face them together. I told him that never again would I withhold my affection or my forgiveness from him, and never, I prayed, would he withhold them from me. I told him I was honored to be his father and that I would try with all my heart to be worthy of such a great responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p25\" class=\"\">Well, I have not proven to be the perfect father I vowed to be that night and a thousand nights before and since. But I still want to be, and I believe this wise counsel from President Joseph F. Smith:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cBrethren, \u2026 If you will keep your [children] close to your heart, within the clasp of your arms; if you will make them \u2026 feel that you love them \u2026 and keep them near to you, they will not go very far from you, and they will not commit any very great sin. But it is when you turn them out of the home, turn them out of your affection \u2026 that [is what] drives them from you. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cFathers, if you wish your children to be taught in the principles of the gospel, if you wish them to love the truth and understand it, if you wish them to be obedient to and united with you, love them! and prove \u2026 that you do love them by your every word and act to[ward] them.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Doctrine,<\/span> 5th ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1966, pp. 282, 316.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/within-the-clasp-of-your-arms.p28\" class=\"\">Brethren, we all know fatherhood is not an easy assignment, but it ranks among the most imperative ever given, in time or eternity. We must not pull away from our children. We must keep trying, keep reaching, keep praying, keep listening. We must keep them \u201cwithin the clasp of our arms.\u201d That is what friends are for. Of this I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
