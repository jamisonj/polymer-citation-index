I feel very weak\nand humble in this position, and I do earnestly pray for an interest in your faith and prayers.\n<\/p><p>\nI wish to extend my appreciation and gratitude to the great number of you who received me\nso kindly in this appointment.  I appreciate the many prayers that have gone up in my behalf.\nWith you, I feel a keen loss in our beloved President George Albert Smith.  Coming from an\noutside stake, I feel in a measure that I represent the good people who live on the fringe of\nthe Church, who do not always have opportunity to express the love that is in their hearts for\nthese great leaders who depart from among us.\n<\/p><p>\nLOVED BY ALL\n<\/p><p>\nPresident George Albert Smith was close to me, he always seemed to be around for some of\nthe important events of my life. I appreciated sincerely his confidence and love, and I rejoice\nthat it was he who called me to this present assignment. As a boy, I remember his coming\ninto my father's and mother's home to attend quarterly conferences representing the General\nAuthorities of the Church. And as I relive those occasions, I rejoice in the goodly effect that\nhe had upon my life. He was loved by all good members of the Church everywhere. He\nradiated a kindly and lovable spirit wherever he went, he brought good will to the Church and\nits people. As has been said, he was a man without guile\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27484\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27484)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27484)\">John 1:47<\/a><\/span>). I think he has left with us a gem of\ncounsel as so many times in his talks he has advised us to stay on the Lord's side of the line.\nThat counsel will live throughout eternity in our hearts. A very simple statement, yet one that\nwill produce great good in the lives of individuals if they will but follow it.\n<\/p><p>\nThe eighth chapter in the leadership of this Church has been closed in the departing of this\ngood man. As I reflect back over the eight spiritual leaders of this people, in my heart I feel\nthat God wanted each of them to lead his people, and that each was specially fitted and\nendowed for the work of his time and generation. The chapter now closed in the book of the\nlife and activities of President George Albert Smith is a glorious one of great attainment on\nthe part of the Church. He built ably upon the foundation laid, so now this people can\ncontinue to go ahead in the accomplishment of the great purposes that God has for his people\nto accomplish.\n<\/p><p>\nGOD AT THE HELM\n<\/p><p>\nAs I have thought about the past three days and all that has taken place, my testimony has\nincreased in relation to the work we are engaged in. All plans have gone forward for this\ngreat general conference of the Church. And almost on the eve of the conference meetings,\nthe Lord took from us our beloved President. At first there was a great feeling of loss, but I\ndon't think ever a feeling of frustration, for the Quorum of the Twelve realized that vested\nwithin them were all the powers, authorities, and keys necessary to carry forward the\nimportant work of this great Church. Committees were appointed to plan the services that\nwould honor and recognize our beloved prophet-leader. Everything seemed to fit into a proper\npattern, the services were held, and our hearts were touched by the beautiful thoughts\nexpressed, the consolation given to members of the family and to all of us who mourn the\npassing of our President.\n<\/p><p>\nYet the 121st annual conference went on as scheduled and there was a feeling that God was at\nthe helm; that the affairs of his Church, even at such a critical time, were being properly\nhandled. And so we come here today, not disturbed in our faith, not disturbed in the\nleadership now handling the affairs of the Church. Everything has fit into a pattern, for God\nestablished the pattern, and the people know where the authority of leadership is vested when\nthe President prophet-leader is taken. There has hardly been a ripple in the scene of our work\nor activities, and yet we have paused properly to honor and recognize our great spiritual\nleader.\n<\/p><p>\nBrothers and sisters, this is to me a testimony of the strength and divinity of this work. In my\nheart, I feel that God is with us and directing his work, that as we go from this conference to\nour homes, we will not be confused, nor will we feel in our hearts that this work will stop.\nthere will be unity in our faith, we will go away in confidence, knowing that the work of the\nLord will continue to go forward and fulfil its destiny in the earth. And as I reflect upon these\nthings, I remember what the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith before the Prophet had\nbeen endowed with the priesthood and before the Church itself had been organized. He said\nthat \"a great and a marvelous work is about to come forth unto the children of men\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12864\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12864)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12864)\">D&amp;C 6:1<\/a><\/span>); and\nsurely this is a great and marvelous work which we represent. Very shortly after the\norganization of the Church, less than a year and a half, the Lord speaking to the elders of the\nChurch said: \n<\/p><p>\nWherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great\nwork. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12899\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12899)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12899)\">D&amp;C 64:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAccording to the law that God had revealed, and in keeping with the law of the land, this\nChurch was established with only six members. Yet the early rise of the Church from that\nhumble beginning was great and marvelous, the Lord was pleased, and the brethren engaged\nin the work of the ministry had been very diligent and devoted. The Lord didn't want them to\nbe weary in well-doing because they were laying the foundations of a great work. In the\npreface to the book of Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord said: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . those to whom these commandments were given, might have power to lay the\nfoundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness,\nthe only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12857\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12857)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12857)\">D&amp;C 1:30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then again, a little later the Lord said: \n<\/p><p>\nFor Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her\nstakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her\nbeautiful garments (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12909\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12909)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12909)\">D&amp;C 82:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMEN OF STRENGTH\n<\/p><p>\nWe know the Church passed through many trials and many tribulations, that brethren along\nthe way deserted the Prophet, and the Saints suffered mobbings and all types of hardships and\nprivations, but there were in the Church men of strength and character men who believed in\nthis great latter-day work; and the power of the Lord rested with them. They were undaunted\nin the face of these difficulties. But the work of the Lord went on, and our people were led\nhere to the valleys of the mountains by President Brigham Young. He had the vision of\nenlarging the borders of Zion and sent out groups to colonize and settle the fertile valleys of\nthese mountains, both north and south and east and west. Thus the great work of the Church\nhas continued to grow, even until the present time, and each of our prophet leaders took his\nplace, gave of himself and of the talents that God had blessed him with to establish firmly the\nfoundations of this work. And as surely as we are here today, it has been brought forth out of\nobscurity and out of darkness, and stands as a beacon of light upon the hill to all peoples and\nnations of the earth. We have witnessed in the progress of the Church, a great enlarged\nprogram to take care of our people. This program encircles the entire life of the Church\nmembership and gives them every opportunity for growth, for development, and for training.\nSurely in this work, the Lord has been with his people; so today with pride in our progress\nwe claim almost sixteen hundred wards and branches of the Church, 184 stakes, scattered up\nand down this western area with some to the east of us. We also have many missions\nestablished throughout the world, and with all our program and activity, the Church itself is\nknown far and wide and assuming its place of leadership and of power in shaping the lives of\nmen and of nations.\n<\/p><p>\nPROSELYTING IN STAKES\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it seems to me, my brothers and sisters, that the Lord in this enlargement of our borders\nhas been with this people, and has so arranged it that we are now established in the\npopulation centers of this western area. We have built our places of worship, our places of\nrecreation, and in all this building, and in all this planning, and in all this preparation, the\nleadership of the Church under the inspiration of God have not had in mind only that we\nshould take care of our own, but that the facilities we have provided should be made available\nto our friends. We have been counseled to warn our neighbors, not to hide our light under a\nbushel (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34414\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34414)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34414)\">Matt. 5:15-16<\/a><\/span>),\nbut to place it where it can be seen of men, that they may have the opportunities and\nthe blessings this Church affords and that you and I enjoy.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it does seem to me, brothers and sisters, in this present critical situation where it is\nimpossible to send all the missionaries into foreign fields we need to send, that we must take\nadvantage of the proselyting opportunity that is ours in the branches, wards, and stakes of the\nChurch; and through our stake missionary program make available to those who are\ninvestigating, the facilities of our Church, that the children of our friends and investigators\ncan come to Primary, to Sunday School, the young men and women to Mutual, the mothers to\nRelief Society, and all to our sacrament meetings. If we as God's people would warn our\nneighbors (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12915\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12915)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12915)\">D&amp;C 88:81<\/a><\/span>),\nand if we would be friends with our neighbors, we will invite them to come with\nus and investigate this thing we know to be true and of God.\n<\/p><p>\nINVITATION TO COME AND SEE\n<\/p><p>\nI think it was only a year ago that President George Albert Smith from this pulpit said that\nwe should invite our friends and our associates to come and see. There is much in the Church\nfor people to come and see, and if we who are members of the Church would live as we\nshould live, we would never be ashamed of that which our friends and our associates do see.\nNot so long ago in attending a conference, I heard a young lady missionary in making her\nreport say that in her missionary experience she felt the Spirit of the Lord working with her.\nAnd I thought what a grand thing it would be if all people of the Church felt that in their\ncallings and appointments the Spirit of the Lord was working with them. I am just as\nconfident as I can be that regardless of our calling and appointments or holding the\npriesthood, we who are the men of the Church, that unless we have the Holy Spirit of the\nLord abiding with us in our work and ministry, we will never accomplish the purposes of\nGod. We need the Holy Spirit, we need its power and its gifts and its influences with us in\nour callings and offices if we carry out successfully the responsibility associated with those\ncallings and appointments.\n<\/p><p>\nI have a testimony of this work, I know it is true. I hope and pray, brothers and sisters, that\nwe will devote ourselves to its high responsibilities. It is the most important thing we have at\nhand to do. May we be appreciative of the Church, of its leadership, of its doctrines, and all\nthe blessings we enjoy, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
