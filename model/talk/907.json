Your words have\nsustained me as have also those of your Counselors which have been spoken. The wisdom and\nthe inspiration of this Church and its teachings have been a great boon in my life.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are two things that deeply impress me in the Latter-day Saint teachings as I labor with\nyouth. First, you must live worthy that you may go on a mission for the Church&mdash;the second\nI will give later.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the Doctrine and Covenants, section 68, we read:\n<\/p><p>\nGo ye into all the world, preach the gospel to every creature, acting in the\nauthority which I have given you, baptizing in the name of the Father, and of the\nSon, and of the Holy Ghost (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13555\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13555)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13555)\">D&amp;C 68:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen the Lord will be with you and bless you.\n<\/p><p>\nThousands have heard and obeyed this word of the Lord. Now why not you, young men, take\nthis opportunity? There will be something seriously wanting in your life unless you have this\nexperience. Here is one of the finest things you can do for peace, happiness, and personal\nprogress. Plan now, now!\n<\/p><p>\nAs the thought crosses your mind, let it meet high resolve in your own life. There are\nthousands who are waiting to hear the word of the Lord. Yes, many are waiting to hear your\nvoice.\n<\/p><p>\nMy religion is your religion; let us live this great life fully together.\n<\/p><p>\nThe second thing I suggest to you, my young friends&mdash;you must be worthy to be married in a\ntemple of the Lord for time and for eternity.\n<\/p><p>\nIt may take time for you and your young bride-to-be to understand all that it signifies, it may\ntake a little courage, for it all seems so strange, but it is beautiful and understandable. It will\nbe an answer to your prayer and to mine.\n<\/p><p>\nRemember, you said that night as you proposed, \"It must be in a temple of God.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt was in an early testimony meeting, after you made that declaration, that I saw you both\nstand together, and you, young man, courageously spoke for both of you. I was sitting in the\naudience. My, how you thrilled me. I said, \"Now you are on the way. This will be a great\nlife. Joy will fill your hearts. This is the Mormon way of life.\"\n<\/p><p>\nTo go on a mission, to be married in the temple of God for time and for eternity!\n<\/p><p>\nOne father, a nonmember of the Church, said, when his son was ready for departure\nfor his mission: \"Son, I am very proud of you. Your life and your conduct have been an\ninspiration to your mother and me. Son, I want to be your first convert to the Church. Take\nhold of me. Don't let me turn back. I want to be your first convert.\"\n<\/p><p>\nFor these lovely experiences for our youth, I humbly pray. There is much that can be said for\nthe Latter-day Saint Church program. It has been blessed and inspired of the Lord. As you\nhave listened this day, the day before, and the day before that, your meditations have been\nenriching. The Lord has been talking to you.\n<\/p><p>\nI have selected merely these two great teachings, which I feel are especially vital to the lives\nand happiness of our youth.\n<\/p><p>\nIn a few days thousands of youth from all parts of the United States will meet at Valley\nForge, and then a few days later, thousands more will meet in London, England. They will\ncome from all over the world. They are of many colors and races; I have camped with them;\nI know these men and boys; and if I may be bold to say, they have faith in God!\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless us as we make more and more friends, as we mingle with people that we\nmay give freely that which God has given us so abundantly, I pray in the name of Jesus\nChrist. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
