I appreciate the wonderful sermons which have been delivered here\nfrom the first through Brother Dyer's.\n<\/p><p>\nI sat thinking a moment ago of my sainted father who left his little family and departed this\nearth more than thirty-five years ago, how he went into the missionary field at the call of the\nLord through the Brethren, in his late teens, carrying copies of the Book of Mormon with\ntestimony and conviction, expressing his deepest assurance of the validity of the work he\nrepresented and yet without adequate knowledge, perhaps, because he was but a boy and\nbecause much knowledge now available was not had, to defend his viewpoint in the eyes of\nthe world. He had but his testimony, his faith, and the Book.\n<\/p><p>\nAs President Smith spoke I marveled that we have lived long enough and that we live in a\ntime, you and I, when the wise men, the honest men of the world, are coming to understand\nsome of the things the Lord has taught us through all the years since the establishment of the\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\nAs President Smith referred to the age of eight and his faith that a youngster at that age can\nknow, I thought of my little children and then of a book published recently, written by two of\nthe most accepted, and I think effective, child psychologists of the day, commenting on the\nage \"eight\" in the lives of the young.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Eight seems to be an age when much that was not comprehended before is often easily\nunderstood. At that age it is almost as though a new dimension has been added to the child's\nunderstanding.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt is remarkable that qualified and earnest seekers after truth should discover that at age eight\na new dimension enters into the life of the child. The Lord assured us of this when he talked\nof the age of accountability long ago\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23656\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23656)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23656)\">Gen. 17:11 (JST)<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13758\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13758)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13758)\">D&amp;C 68:25,27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOf one thing implicit in both President Smith's and Brother Dyer's remarks, I would speak\nfor just a few moments.\n<\/p><p>\nA thoughtful friend phoned this morning to tell me of a book he had just received&mdash;I had not\nseen a copy nor is it available in our bookstores yet&mdash;a book called, <i>I Found God in Soviet Russia<\/i>,\nin which a man tells of his own experiences as a prisoner in a concentration camp in\nSiberia.\n<\/p><p>\nHe talks of the religious faith that permitted people to endure and survive.\nHe mentions in at least four different places, and this would perhaps be a satisfying if\nsorrowful and surprising thing for us to know, that in a concentration camp in Siberia there is\na little band of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, meeting faithfully\nand loyally, unwilling to deny or let rest or become indifferent to their responsibilities even\nthough to be a member of the Church makes them liable to life imprisonment according to the\nbook.\n<\/p><p>\nThe book notes that these Mormons insisted on coming together in the name of the \nLord&mdash;that when they had a few minutes they met to worship God in their own way.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I think how the Lord must love and look with compassion upon such individuals, when\nout of my own experience as a parent I can see how much I love my little ones, I can\nunderstand (at least within my limitations) what the Lord meant when he talked about the\nworth of souls in his sight. And I believe I may understand it more impressively and\nmovingly today than I have ever understood it before.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I read you some words with which all are familiar, and read them in context of what has\nbeen said?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God;<br \/> \n\"For behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the\npain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13713\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13713)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13713)\">D&amp;C 18:10-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere follows the great statement of the joy of the Lord in the soul that repenteth, and this: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and\nbring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of\nmy father!\"<br \/>\nAnd then the marvelous statement that \". . . if your joy will be great with one soul . . . how\ngreat will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13715\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13715)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13715)\">D&amp;C 18:15-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI have in mind to express my testimony about the importance of the one, to add my humble\nwitness to the charge that has been given every teacher and parent, every youth-influencing,\nevery adult-influencing Latter-day Saint, to be concerned about the one individual child of\nGod.\n<\/p><p>\nI heard a statement as I drove toward Brigham Young University the other morning from the\nTalmud, or so it was quoted: \"To save one life is like saving a whole nation.\" And I began to\nthink of other statements, including the one from the eighteenth section of the Doctrine and\nCovenants, to which we have alluded. I thought of the statement of Oliver Wendell Holmes,\nwho said, \"Every individual is an omnibus.\" Do you see the significance and implication of\nthis?\n<\/p><p>\nAs we have the marvelous blessing of setting missionaries apart, I can seldom refrain from\nthinking of them (and occasionally say it) that in each of them, as in each of us, is wrapped\nup a heritage and a promise, for each is a distillation of much that has gone before, and\nbeyond all that is represented in the individual now and of the past, there is also the future,\nbecause in each of us are the seeds of the future; in each of us there is, in fact, the capacity\nand possibility of becoming many.\n<\/p><p>\nCould I tell you one story which bears repetition&mdash;and I have had the blessing of repeating it\nin some of the stakes of the Church. It is the most significant single experience I have ever\nhad, personally, about the importance of one. It happened long enough ago that I think the\nindividual involved would not be conscious of our noting him, though I see no harm if he is.\n<\/p><p>\nA man walked into these grounds and into an office in the Bureau of Information one day\nlong ago. He interrupted a conversation which was private and serious, and did it without\napology. He was quite an elderly man; he was not what you would call an attractive human\nbeing. He was unkempt, unshaven; he reeked of alcohol and tobacco.\n<\/p><p>\nHe walked over to the desk where I sat, pointed his hand in the direction of the temple, and\nsaid, \"How do you get in there?\" I assumed that he was a tourist, one of the infrequent but\noccasional few who do not understand the purpose and the reason of temple-going and who\nhave become affronted because they are not taken into the temple, and perhaps had come to\ncomplain.\n<\/p><p>\nI told him as best I could, or began to, the story of the temple, but had \nproceeded only a little distance when he interrupted.  He waved me away and said, \"Oh, you\ndon't have to tell me all that, I know that.  I am a Mormon.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well,\" I said, \"if you are a member of the Church and you know all of this, what is it you\nwant from me?\"  He said, \"Frankly, nothing.  There isn't anything you have to give me.  I am\nhere because my wife insisted on my coming in, but I have fulfilled my errand,\" and out he\nwent.\n<\/p><p>\nI tried to pick up the threads of the conversation and finish it, and later, as I sat thinking\nabout him and his story, I looked out the window and saw him walking by the Joseph and\nHyrum [Smith] monuments with a younger woman.  I went out to talk with them.  She\nidentified herself as his wife.  He had been married three times; each previous wife had died\nafter bearing a large family.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are two questions I asked him, which I think each person here would do well to hear\nanswered as he answered them.  I asked, in effect, how he had come to his feeling of\nantagonism and indifference.  He told me that at age nineteen he had been ejected from a\nchapel by a bishop's counselor who had been summoned because of the boy's trouble-making\nin class.  One thing that had been said, this man remembered for nearly sixty years.  As he\nwas thrown out, someone objected.  The answer that came from the counselor who had the\ntask in hand was, \"Ah, let him go, he is just one kid!\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe went, and he never came back, nor was there ever any visiting, never any outpouring or\nincrease of the love that should follow reproof, according to the Lord.  He moved to another\narea of the land, married, had a family; his wife passed away and he married again, his\nsecond wife died after bearing a family also.  He had come to Salt Lake City at the insistence\nof his third wife, who, having been taught by the missionaries and converted to the principles\nof the gospel, had brought him here hoping that somehow he might be touched&mdash;he, the\nmember.\n<\/p><p>\nThis, also, I would like to report:  I asked him how many living descendants he had.  He\ncounted them and answered, \"Fifty-four.\"  I asked him then, how many of them are members\nof the Church, and I expect you know the answer, though perhaps not his interesting\nexpression.  He said, \"Huh, ain't any of them members of the Church.  They're a pretty hard\nlot.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThis last question:  who was it the bishop's counselor propelled out the door that morning? \nJust one boy?  Just one?  This one has in his own lifetime become, in effect, a multitude, and\nthe current has but begun to run, and every one of them denied, according to his own witness,\nthe love of the gospel and the brotherhood of the Saints, the warmth and strength and\ndirection of the programs of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nOh, I can understand a little more, why the Lord said that one soul was precious to him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13714\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13714)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13714)\">D&amp;C 18:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI close with a statement Horace Mann made.  This is well-known also, but worth the\nrepetition.  To a man who questioned Horace Mann's statement at the dedication of a boy's\nhome or school, that if all the work and energy and effort and money put into this endeavor\nhad been to save just one boy, it would have been worth it, and had said to Horace Mann,\n\"You became too oratorical, didn't you?  You didn't really mean that, did you?\"&mdash;Horace\nMann answered, \"Oh, yes, I meant it.  It would have all been worth it, if the one were my\nson.\"\n<\/p><p>\nEvery son of God is important in his eyes.  Every unbaptized child, unordained boy, young\nman who is not in the right stage of his priesthood progression, every boy and girl not\nattending seminary when they can and should, every boy and girl not being married the\ntemple when they could&mdash;these are vitally important in the eyes of God and should be, in our\neyes.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us to understand the infinite importance of the one, in God's eyes, and to do all\nthat we can to fulfil his purposes for them, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
