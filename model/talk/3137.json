It has been glorious and fulfilling beyond all expectations. When we first arrived, Sister Featherstone went to the Lord and said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time. Please let me learn quickly so that the work will go forth.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p5\" class=\"\">Later she said, \u201cThe Lord has answered my prayers. He taught me several great lessons. One of those lessons came after the first three or four weeks in the mission field. I was unable to find a few minutes each day to repair to a quiet spot. When I was home I would take about forty-five minutes in the afternoon and go out and curry down my Arabian horse. I would retreat into a world of my own for those few minutes.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p6\" class=\"\">She could not find time for even a few minutes for herself in the mission field.

And that work standard is compared to our work standard and not someone else\u2019s.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p8\" class=\"\">Let me share with you some of the \u201cfaith\u201d experiences of the messengers with whom we have served.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p9\" class=\"\">Elder and Sister Weidel wrote in their weekly letter: \u201cPlease, may we take a few moments to tell you of a spiritual experience this week. Friday Elder Curtis, who was splitting with Elder Aloi, came to work with us and afterwards we took them home. Elder Aloi invited us in to see what a real elders\u2019 apartment looks like. He went through the back door to open the front door, and in a moment he came out beaming.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p10\" class=\"\">\u2018Elder, come and see what has been brought to us.\u2019 There on the table was a large supply of groceries. After a while Elder Curtis told us that Elder Aloi and his companion had found a family that didn\u2019t have anything to eat, so they took all of their own food out to them. Our hearts just about broke,\u201d wrote Sister Weidel. \u201cThe Lord does take care of his own.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p11\" class=\"\">One of the sweet, widowed sister missionaries, Lorna Call Alder, said in her weekly letter to me: \u201cThe experiences of my mission have strengthened my testimony greatly. I cannot remember when I gained a testimony, but I do remember many experiences that have enriched and built upon the foundation I have. Of the many humbling experiences I\u2019ve had, these past eight months have brought me closer to the Lord than any other period. I\u2019ve lived through three revolutions in Mexico, which really built my testimony. Writing lessons for the Church brings one very close to the Lord, and he did bless me with more than I can tell you. But this mission has given me more twenty-four-hour spirituality than I have ever had.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cOther very spiritual uplifts in my life were times my sons were on their missions and they asked me to read the Book of Mormon while they were gone. My husband died while my oldest son was in Chile on his mission, and I was really humbled during that trying period. I am thankful for this experience of hard work and great blessings. With humility and thanksgiving, Sister Alder.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p13\" class=\"\">Some months back we had a lovely couple assigned to our mission. Before they arrived, I received a letter from their daughter. In part she said: \u201cDear President Featherstone, you are getting two of the most wonderful folks in the world in a few weeks to serve in your mission for eighteen months. They are just tickled pink to be serving under you. They told me they plan to do whatever you tell them to do. You enjoy mom and dad. We\u2019ll miss them, so please take good care of them while they are there.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p14\" class=\"\">Most of our missionaries come into the field because they love the Lord Jesus Christ and they desire to serve him and bring souls unto him. There are a few, however, who rationalize themselves out of a call or try to justify poor performance in the mission field\u2014like the man who received his pay envelope and noticed that he had been shorted five dollars. He went to the paymaster and said, \u201cYou shorted me five dollars in my pay envelope this week.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p15\" class=\"\">The paymaster responded, \u201cWell, I have been expecting you.

Many of us understand the blessings that come when children and grandchildren kneel down at night and say, \u201cDear Heavenly Father, please bless grandma and grandpa, who are out in Texas on a mission.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p18\" class=\"\">Sister Olsen mothered twelve children, and she supported all of her sons on missions.

At the time, he drove cars across the country for a foreign car company. When his boss, who was not LDS, heard he was going to be gone for two years to serve a mission, he said, \u201cIf you will stay at home and work for me, I will give you a $28,000 Ferrari.\u201d Elder Grannis completed his mission a month ago as a presiding zone leader.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p20\" class=\"\">Another elder entered the mission just after I arrived in San Antonio. He came from a large family. The father found that he needed to pick up a part-time job to help support his son. This was not quite enough, and so the sweet mother went to work in the school lunch program so that she could be home when her children were home. Even with this additional money, the elder fell a little further behind each month. A choice friend occasionally gives me several $100 bills to share where they are needed. When I interviewed this elder, I asked him how he was doing financially. His eyes clouded up, and he said was really trying, but his folks weren\u2019t sending him quite enough. He said, \u201cPresident, I haven\u2019t been wasting. I haven\u2019t eaten anything for three days, trying to cut back.\u201d Then he said, \u201cEven my little sister is helping. She received a one-dollar bill for her birthday, and she put it in an envelope and sent it to me because she thought I needed it more than she did.\u201d Then he wept openly. I reached into my shirt pocket, and extracted two crisp $100 bills, and said, \u201cA choice friend of mine asked me to give these to you.\u201d He put his head down in his hands and was overcome.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p21\" class=\"\">Elder Daniel Gifford was promised in his patriarchal blessing that he would serve closely with a General Authority while he was on his mission. He wondered how this would be when he received his mission call to Texas, where the mission president had only served two or three months. While he was in the Missionary Training Center listening to the final session of October general conference, he heard President Tanner announce that the next speaker would be Elder Vaughn J. Featherstone, a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy and newly called president of the Texas San Antonio Mission. When Elder Gifford was later called to be an assistant to the president, he shared his patriarchal blessing promise with us. Do you think he has any question about whose work this is?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p22\" class=\"\">One elder who was transferred from another mission wanted to go home. He knew his parents and bishop wanted him to stay and complete his mission. In one of the many interviews we had, he said that five previous elders in his ward had abandoned their missions and had returned home early. I thought what a great disservice the first elder did to the other young men who followed his poor example. I made a solemn vow that this elder would not go home until his mission was completed successfully. Every week for thirteen to fifteen weeks he would write in his letter to the president all the reasons he should be released from his mission. Each week I wrote a letter of response.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p23\" class=\"\">After all these weeks I received a letter which appeared the same as the others\u2014until I got to the P.S. He said, \u201cPresident, you are winning and you know it.\u201d I sat in my office, and tears filled my eyes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p24\" class=\"\">Vince Lombardi said, \u201cThe harder you fight for something, the harder it is to surrender.\u201d This elder completed his mission as a great presiding zone leader. He has a great warmth and a great talent to teach; he loves and cares for people; and he is extremely spiritual. He returned home with an honorable release from a very successful mission, married a beautiful girl in the temple, and now they live near the temple where they visit regularly. This elder set a great example for all prospective missionaries from his ward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p25\" class=\"\">Elder Sheffield has been under the knife eleven times in major surgery and many more times in surgery lasting less than an hour. The greatest desire of his life was that the surgery would make him acceptable for a mission. A year before he entered the mission field, he had his final operation. Since he has been on his mission, he has averaged seventy to eighty hours a week in proselyting. He is greatly loved by all.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p26\" class=\"\">He has been a great blessing to missionaries who thought they had problems. In one interview his companion told me that Elder Sheffield\u2019s shoulder separates and falls out of place quite often. When this happens he is in severe pain. It happens most often during the night. When I interviewed Elder Sheffield, I suggested that we put him in a local hospital here and have the doctors do what needed to be done to correct this problem. He looked me in the eye, and with a sternness seldom seen he said, \u201cPresident, I have spent most of my life in hospitals, and when I complete my mission I am returning to several more major surgical operations. I promised the Lord that if he would let me serve a mission, I would not spend one day in the hospital during the two years no matter how sick I was or how much I suffered.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p27\" class=\"\">What are the blessings of a mission? \u201cCan ye tell?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9287\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9287)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9287)\">Alma 26:2<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1978\/11\/what-are-the-blessings-of-a-mission-can-ye-tell.p28\" class=\"\">Maybe Brother and Sister William Keith Clark can. \u201cDear President Featherstone,\u201d they wrote, \u201cwe were happy to receive your letter.
