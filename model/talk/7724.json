Works by Gainsborough, Rembrandt, Constable, and other renowned artists were displayed in room after room. I admired their beauty and recognized the skill which had been required to create these masterpieces. Tucked away in a quiet corner of the third floor, however, was a painting which not only caught my attention but also captured my heart. The artist, Frank Bramley, had painted a humble cottage facing a windswept sea. Two women, the mother and the wife of an absent fisherman, had watched and waited the night through for his return. Now the night had passed, and the realization had set in that he had been lost at sea and would not return. Kneeling at the side of her mother-in-law, her head buried in the lap of the older woman, the young wife wept in despair. The spent candle on the window ledge told of the fruitless vigil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/he-is-risen.p6\" class=\"\">I sensed the young woman\u2019s heartache; I felt her grief.

On one of his visits to see Jason, his father found him with his eyes closed. Not knowing whether Jason was asleep or awake, he began talking softly to him. \u201cJason,\u201d he said, \u201cI know you have been through a lot in your short life and that your current condition is difficult. Even though you have a giant battle ahead, I don\u2019t ever want you to lose your faith in Jesus Christ.\u201d He said he was startled as Jason immediately opened his eyes and said, \u201cNever!\u201d in a clear, resolute voice. Jason then closed his eyes and said no more.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/he-is-risen.p48\" class=\"\">His father wrote: \u201cIn this simple declaration, Jason expressed one of the most powerful, pure testimonies of Jesus Christ that I have ever heard. \u2026 As his declaration of \u2018Never!\u2019 became imprinted on my soul that day, my heart filled with joy that my Heavenly Father had blessed me to be the father of such a tremendous and noble boy. \u2026 [It] was the last time I heard him declare his testimony of Christ.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/he-is-risen.p49\" class=\"\">Although his family was expecting this to be just another routine hospitalization, Jason passed away less than two weeks later. An older brother and sister were serving missions at the time. Another brother, Kyle, had just received his mission call. In fact, the call had come earlier than expected, and on August 5, just a week before Jason\u2019s passing, the family gathered in his hospital room so that Kyle\u2019s mission call could be opened there and shared with the entire family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/he-is-risen.p50\" class=\"\">In his letter to me, this father included a photograph of Jason in his hospital bed, with his big brother Kyle standing beside the bed, holding his mission call. This caption was written beneath the photograph: \u201cCalled to serve their missions together\u2014on both sides of the veil.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/he-is-risen.p51\" class=\"\">Jason\u2019s brother and sister already serving missions sent beautiful, comforting letters home to be shared at Jason\u2019s funeral. His sister, serving in the Argentina Buenos Aires West Mission, as part of her letter, wrote: \u201cI know that Jesus Christ lives, and because He lives, all of us, including our beloved Jason, will live again too. \u2026 We can take comfort in the sure knowledge we have that we have been sealed together as an eternal family. \u2026 If we do our very best to obey and do better in this life, we will see [him again].\u201d She continued: \u201c[A] scripture that I have long loved now takes on new significance and importance at this time. \u2026 [From] <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120311\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120311)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120311)\">Revelation chapter 21, verse 4<\/a><\/span>: \u2018And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/he-is-risen.p52\" class=\"\">My beloved brothers and sisters, in our hour of deepest sorrow, we can receive profound peace from the words of the angel that first Easter morning: \u201cHe is not here: for he is risen.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote17-09205_000_034\">17<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120211\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120211)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120211)\">Matthew 28:6<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t      <span class=\"emphasis\">He is risen!
