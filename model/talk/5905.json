They were humble, new converts to the Church, without wealth or position. Their temple work was their final concern as they were leaving their homes in Nauvoo to come west. It was fortunate that President Young granted the wish of the Saints to receive their temple blessings because John Akerley died at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. He, along with over 4,000 others, never made it to the valleys of the Rocky Mountains.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-97905_000_009\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Church News,<\/span> 7 Dec. 1996, 2.]<\/span><\/sup> William Clayton\u2019s classic Mormon hymn \u201cCome, Come, Ye Saints\u201d captures well their faith: \u201cAnd should we die before our journey\u2019s through, happy day!

Why were all of these temples built at such cost and sacrifice? Why are they still being built at an ever-increasing pace? It is because the deepest questions of our existence are answered in the temple. These answers tell us where we came from, why we are here, where we may go, and how we may cope with the matter of death. This life makes no logical sense unless we think in terms of the eternities. The transcendent blessings of life and eternity are received within the sacred walls of the temple. The Savior\u2019s supernal gift to mankind gave us the opportunity for eternal life, but eternal life without our loved ones would be bleak.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/eternity-lies-before-us.p25\" class=\"\">A basic eternal truth of this Church is that families may, if they are worthy, have an eternal relationship; for us it would not be heaven without our parents, our grandparents, our eternal companions, our children, and our posterity.
