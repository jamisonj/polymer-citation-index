My brothers and sisters, my heart\ngoes out to you who are attempting to live the commandments of the Lord. The \"strength of\nthe hills\" is with you.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a great joy to me, and my heart is overflowing with gratitude, to shake your hands, to\nlook into your smiling faces, and to feel your spirit.\n<\/p><p>\nWe heard this morning that seventeen thousand newly converted people are today enjoying\nthe blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ, are pointed in the right direction, and are on their\nway toward eternal life and exaltation. Ten thousand foreign and stake missionaries have been\ninstrumental in bringing the message to them. These new members are here because these\nthousands have borne witness and testimony to them.\n<\/p><p>\nTo all the millions of good, honorable people who live among us, we extend an invitation to\ninvestigate the gospel of Jesus Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42696\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42696)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42696)\">Rom. 1:16<\/a><\/span>) and to\nexaltation. It is the pearl of greatest price\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34510\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34510)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34510)\">Matt. 13:46<\/a><\/span>). It is the most glorious, the most far-reaching, the\nmost wonderful program in the world. It is not conceived by men, but is conceived by God,\nour Eternal Father.\n<\/p><p>\nSometime ago a sister said to me \"Why is it, Brother Kimball, that those who do the least in\nthe building of the kingdom seem to prosper most? We drive a Ford; our neighbors drive a\nCadillac. We observe the Sabbath and attend our meetings; they play golf, hunt, fish, and\nplay. We abstain from the forbidden while they eat, drink, and are merry and are unrestrained.\nWe pay much as tithing and for other Church donations; they have their entire large income\nto lavish upon themselves. We are tied home with our large family of small children, often ill;\nthey are totally free for social life&mdash;to dine and to dance. We wear cottons and woolens, and\nI wear a three-season coat, but they wear silks and costly apparel, and she wears a mink coat.\nOur meager income is always strained and never seems adequate for necessities, while their\nwealth seems inexhaustible and wholly adequate for every luxury obtainable. And yet the\nLord promises blessings to the faithful! It seems to me that it does not pay to live the\ngospel&mdash;that the proud (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32737\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32737)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32737)\">Mal. 3:15<\/a><\/span>)\nand the covenant breakers are the ones who prosper.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen I said to her: \"As I remember, Job in his great distress made a statement which parallels\nyours.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBut Job answered [Zophar] and said . . . Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are\nmighty in power?\n<\/p><p>\nTheir seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.\n<\/p><p>\nTheir houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.\n<\/p><p>\nTheir bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth and casteth not her calf.\n<\/p><p>\nThey send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance . . .\n<\/p><p>\nThey spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have if we pray\nunto him? (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26661\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26661)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26661)\">Job 21:1,7-11,13-15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the Prophet Jeremiah asked the same question: \n<\/p><p>\nRighteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy\njudgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that\ndeal very treacherously? . . .\n<\/p><p>\nHow long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of\nthem that dwell therein?

Yet ye say, What have we spoken so\nmuch against thee?\n<\/p><p>\nYe have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance,\nand that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up, yea they that\ntempt God are even delivered (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32735\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32735)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32735)\">Mal. 3:13-15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe parable of the wheat and tares is the Lord's answer: \n<\/p><p>\n. . . The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: \n<\/p><p>\nBut while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.\n<\/p><p>\nBut when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.\n<\/p><p>\nSo the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed\nin thy field? from whence then hath it tares?\n<\/p><p>\nHe said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that\nwe go and gather them up?\n<\/p><p>\nBut he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.\n<\/p><p>\nLet both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers,\nGather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat\ninto my barn (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34508\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34508)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34508)\">Matt. 13:24-30<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the interpretation of the parable given by the Lord himself makes clear that the books are\nnot balanced daily but at the harvest-time. The time of reckoning is as sure as is the passage\nof time and the coming of eternity. All who live shall eventually stand before the bar of God\nto be judged according to their works. The final assignments will constitute rewards and\npunishments according to deserts. Read Malachi further: \n<\/p><p>\nThen they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard\nit, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that\nthought upon his name.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I\nwill spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.\n<\/p><p>\nThen shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that\nserveth God and him that serveth him not\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32738\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32738)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32738)\">Mal. 3:16-18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFor behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea and all that do\nwickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of\nhosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.\n<\/p><p>\nBut unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his\nwings . . .

For many rewards you\nneed not wait until the judgment day. You have your family of lovely children. What a rich\nreward for the so-called sacrifices! The great boon of motherhood is yours. With your\nlimitations, a great peace can fill your soul. These and numerous other blessings which you\nenjoy cannot be purchased with all your neighbor's wealth.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen I reminded her of the parable of the net and the fishes: \n<\/p><p>\nAgain, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of\nevery kind: \n<\/p><p>\nWhich, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into\nvessels, but cast the bad away.\n<\/p><p>\nSo shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from\namong the just,\n<\/p><p>\nAnd shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34511\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34511)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34511)\">Matt. 13:47-50<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNo one will escape the reward of his deeds. No one will fail to receive the blessings earned.\nAgain the parable of the sheep and goats gives us assurance that there will be total justice.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he\nsit upon the throne of his glory: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as\na shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.\n<\/p><p>\nThen shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit\nthe kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: \n<\/p><p>\nThen shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting\nfire, prepared for the devil and his angels: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34525\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34525)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34525)\">Matt. 25:31-34,41,46<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf we can walk now by faith, if we can believe in the rich promises of God, if we can obey\nand patiently wait, the Lord will fulfil all his rich promises to us: \n<\/p><p>\n. . .

Blessings beyond one's understanding will come. The land\nwill yield bounteously and peace shall abound. The unfaithful, proud, and wealthy can never\nenjoy the sweet savor of the rewards for fasting and dispensing to the poor: \n<\/p><p>\nThen [if you live these commandments] shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine\nhealth shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the\nLord shall be thy reward.\n<\/p><p>\nThen shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am . . .\n<\/p><p>\n. . . then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noon day: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy\nbones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail\nnot (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"25133\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 25133)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(25133)\">Isa. 58:8-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhat more could one ask?

This squanderer lived but for\ntoday. He spent his life in riotous living. He disregarded the commandments of God. His\ninheritance was expendable, and he spent it. He was never to enjoy it again as it was\nirretrievably gone. No quantity of tears or regrets or remorse could bring it back. Even though\nhis father forgave him and dined him and clothed him and kissed him, he could not give back\nto the profligate son that which had been dissipated. But the other brother who had been\nfaithful, loyal, righteous, constant, retained his inheritance, and the father reassured him: \"All\nthat I have is thine\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31312\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31312)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31312)\">Luke 15:31<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhen one realizes the vastness, the richness, the glory of that \"all\" which the Lord promises\nto bestow upon his faithful, it is worth all it costs in patience, faith, sacrifice, sweat and tears.\nThe blessings of eternity contemplated in this \"all\" bring to men immortality and everlasting\nlife, eternal growth, divine leadership, eternal increase, perfection, and with it all&mdash;Godhood.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God bless us all that we may live his commandments more faithfully, more perfectly day\nby day, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
