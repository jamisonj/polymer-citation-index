We turn from the reverie of such pleasant recollections. We contemplate parents gone, family grown, childhood vanished. Slowly but surely we face the truth: We are responsible for the home we build. We must build wisely, for eternity is not a short voyage. There will be calm and wind, sunlight and shadows, joy and sorrow. But if we really try, our home can be a bit of heaven here on earth. The thoughts we think, the deeds we do, the lives we live influence not only the success of our earthly journey; they mark the way to our eternal goals.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1988\/11\/hallmarks-of-a-happy-home.p9\" class=\"\">Happy homes come in a variety of appearances. Some feature large families with father, mother, brothers, and sisters living together in a spirit of love.

Every night kneel by the side of your bed. One night, Brother Monson, you offer the prayer, aloud, on bended knee. The next night you, Sister Monson, offer the prayer, aloud, on bended knee.

It carried a world of practical application: \u201cChoose your love; love your choice.\u201d She who prepared that message is now in frail health.
