Have you ever taken piano or soccer lessons? Tonight I want to talk to you about developing a talent\u2014not just any talent, but one very special talent I bet you have never even thought about. I would like to talk to you about developing your talent for spirituality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p6\" class=\"\">Did you know that spirituality is a talent? Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles once said, \u201cAbove all talents \u2026 , chief among all endowments\u2014stands the talent for spirituality\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Millennial Messiah<\/span> [1982], 234). Spirituality is learning how to listen to the Spirit and then letting it govern our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p7\" class=\"\">So how do we learn to listen to the Spirit? Well, first of all, we need to understand what the Spirit is. Second, we\u2019ll look at young women who have learned how to recognize the Spirit. As members of the Church, we are given two spiritual gifts: the Light of Christ given to all men at birth and the special gift of the Holy Ghost given after our baptism. It allows us \u201cto live by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the power of revelation, and \u2026 testimony\u201d (Bruce R. McConkie, <span class=\"emphasis\">Doctrines of the Restoration: Sermons and Writings of Bruce R. McConkie,<\/span> ed. Mark L. McConkie [1989], 93). Once we know what the Spirit is, how do we recognize it when we feel it? That\u2019s the hardest part.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p8\" class=\"\">When I was 14, I remember realizing what the Spirit was for the very first time. I loved going to church, especially sacrament meeting. I always felt so warm and peaceful. This was the Spirit. I\u2019m not sure I knew how important it was. I just knew it made me feel good. As an adult, I\u2019ve learned that it not only makes us feel good, it teaches and testifies and cleanses us from sin. It can warn us of danger and help us remember things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p9\" class=\"\">Some young women struggle to identify the Spirit. One girl wrote: \u201cI haven\u2019t really had any experiences with the Holy Ghost, and that\u2019s mostly my fault for not living like I should. But I\u2019m trying harder, and hopefully I will have a chance soon to feel the [comforting influence of the] Holy Ghost\u201d (letter on file in the Young Women office).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p10\" class=\"\">These feelings are normal. This young woman may not know it, but the Holy Ghost is giving her a desire to feel His influence. The Spirit doesn\u2019t always give us warm, fuzzy feelings. Most of the time, the voice of inspiration is a quiet voice, a still, small voice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p11\" class=\"\">I remember what the Savior said to the faithful Nephites when He visited the New World: \u201cI perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my words. \u2026 Go \u2026 [into] your homes, \u2026 ponder upon the things which I have said, and ask \u2026 the Father \u2026 that ye may understand\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5380\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5380)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5380)\">3 Ne. 17:2\u20133<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p12\" class=\"\">The Savior\u2019s words were written for us. It\u2019s OK if we\u2019re weak, as long as we don\u2019t stay weak, as long as we do something about it. Katie is a young woman who did just that. Let me share her story with you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cAll my life I have wanted to be good, but I got to the point where I wondered, \u2018How can anyone really know if the Church is true?\u2019 I took Moroni\u2019s challenge and for five months prayed and read my scriptures every day. One night I sat on my bed almost in tears, giving up. I decided to pray. I said, \u2018Heavenly Father, help me to please just know you are there. I\u2019ve done what Thou hast asked according to the Church and I just really need to know.\u2019 Immediately I felt like someone had wrapped their arms around me. I didn\u2019t hear a loud voice or see an angel, but I felt Heavenly Father telling me, \u2018Sweet Katie, you\u2019ve known all along.\u2019 It was like a kind and loving father comforting his little girl\u201d (letter).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p14\" class=\"\">One of the main functions of the Holy Ghost is to testify of truth. The Spirit testified to Katie that the gospel is true. Katie had paid the price. As the Savior said, she went to her home, studied His words, and prayed\u2014for five whole months. Katie is developing her talent for spirituality. She can use this gift to govern her life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p15\" class=\"\">Talents are meant to be shared. As you learn to play the piano, you can bless others with your music. As you develop your talent for spirituality, you can use this gift to bless your family. Did you know you have some responsibility for the happiness in your family? It isn\u2019t just your mom\u2019s or dad\u2019s job to keep the family happy. You can help too. Listen to what Brooke did as she shared her talent for spirituality.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cMy eight-year-old sister was scared of strangers coming into the house. One night she came into my room, and I tried to explain to her that she wasn\u2019t hearing anyone walking around. I remembered my seminary teacher challenged us to always try to have Heavenly Father\u2019s Spirit with us. So I prayed in my heart that I would get help to not be frustrated. A verse came instantly into my head. I opened the scriptures and told her to read it to me. Then I was bearing testimony to her about the Holy Ghost and how if she wanted peace to get down and pray and the Spirit would come. She gave me a hug and kiss and went off to bed. Then I remembered my 10-year-old sister on the top bunk. She told me she never knew that if you wanted something like that you could pray and the Spirit would bring you peace. I know the Holy Ghost was inspiring me to say that\u201d (letter).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p17\" class=\"\">There are lots of ways you can bless your family. Brooke did three important things: she bore her testimony, she prayed for her sister, and she was an example to her other sister on the top bunk. This strengthened her own spirituality as well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p18\" class=\"\">The Savior invites us to bear testimony. He has said, \u201cGo ye into all the world, preach the gospel to every creature\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11137\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11137)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11137)\">D&amp;C 68:8<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p19\" class=\"\">Many of you love bearing testimony at camp. Well, you don\u2019t have to wait for camp. You can bear your testimony to your family often in simple ways.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p20\" class=\"\">When my grandchildren visited me and we saw a picture of President Hinckley, I said, \u201cI love President Hinckley. I am so grateful to have a living prophet on the earth today.\u201d It took about 10 seconds, but it taught my grandchildren and helped us feel the Spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p21\" class=\"\">We bear testimony every single day by our example. Just last month when I was writing this talk, my daughter Jill came home, happily fixed dinner, and washed the dishes. The sweet spirit she carries in her heart blesses our home. I know she loves Jesus by the way she shows her love for me. Another way we show our love for Jesus is through prayer. President Hinckley has said, \u201cLet every family in this Church have prayer together\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley<\/span> [1997], 216). \u201cYour daily conversations with [H]im will bring peace into your hearts and a joy into your lives that can come from no other source\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley,<\/span> 216).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p22\" class=\"\">You can help your family remember to pray. Prayer is like an umbrella in the storms of life. When I was a busy mom with seven children at home, I was so grateful when one of my children would say, \u201cWe forgot to have family prayer.\u201d Sometimes we would stand by the back door and pray as the children ran off to school. It always strengthened the spirituality in our home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p23\" class=\"\">And you can pray for your family. If there is contention, pray for a spirit of peace. No matter what, Heavenly Father will bless you with peace in your heart. Prayer is a miracle; it can help develop the spirituality in your home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p24\" class=\"\">Recently, our prophet, President Hinckley, prayed for the youth of the Church. It was a never-to-be-forgotten experience.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p25\" class=\"\">Can you even imagine how wonderful it would be to know that Jesus prays for us? When He was among the Nephites, \u201che \u2026 knelt upon the earth; and \u2026 prayed unto the Father. \u2026 No one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5382\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5382)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5382)\">3 Ne. 17:15, 17<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p26\" class=\"\">Could it be with you as it was with the Nephite children? As the Savior ministered to them, \u201che did loose their tongues, and they did speak \u2026 great and marvelous things, even greater than he had revealed unto the people\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5388\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5388)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5388)\">3 Ne. 26:14<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p27\" class=\"\">With the power of the Spirit, you too can speak great and marvelous things in your own family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p28\" class=\"\">These children \u201csaw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and encircled those little ones about \u2026 ; and the angels did minister unto them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5383\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5383)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5383)\">3 Ne. 17:24<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p29\" class=\"\">You may never see angels descending out of heaven, but I can promise you as you bear testimony and pray in your families, unseen angels will minister to you. As you share your talent for spirituality, you will feel the warmth and power of the Spirit governing your life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p30\" class=\"\">The prophets are right. You young women \u201care part of the greatest generation we have ever had\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley,<\/span> 718). You can be a strong influence on your family. It is a true principle that the Lord operates through families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/developing-our-talent-for-spirituality.p31\" class=\"\">Now that you have learned how the Spirit works and how you as young women can use it to bless your families, it is our prayer that you will let spirituality become you. Heavenly Father is eager to unleash this great power. May the Spirit bless you as you develop your talent for spirituality, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
