I felt impressed that I should read it to see if it was desirable for children. As I read it, I found it highly undesirable for sixth-graders. It contained profanity, violence, disrespect for adults, especially parents, and was generally gloomy and depressing, with nothing of love and beauty and goodness. I discussed the book with the principal of the school and told him of my concerns. He suggested that I read the whole series of books before condemning them, and if I still felt the same way I could write my objections in a letter and give them to him, giving specific examples of objectionable materials.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/but-be-ye-doers-of-the-word.p35\" class=\"\">\u201cI complied with his suggestion and continued to read the other books and found them also unfit for our children.

He said they were highly embarrassed that someone should have to point out to them the objectionable nature of the books, and that they would see that those persons responsible for reviewing the books in the future did a more thorough job.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/but-be-ye-doers-of-the-word.p37\" class=\"\">We have been blessed with the light of the gospel to lead us and to guide and direct our lives.
