It gives you a wonderful feeling of confidence, doesn't it, to know that the\nrising generation is made up of such marvelous young people.\n<\/p><p>\nTwo weeks ago my wife and I had the opportunity of attending a meeting of some hundreds\nof M Men and Gleaner Girls, and there again we were impressed with the fact that our young\npeople are great.  Those hundreds of young people stood up in that meeting and gave the\nMIA theme for this year.  I wish you could have heard them because they spoke with such\nclarity.  They were in almost perfect unison, and as they said these words, it gave me a great\nthrill: \n<\/p><p>\nSeek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, the mysteries of God shall be\nunfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich.  Behold, he that hath eternal life\nis rich (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13351\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13351)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13351)\">D&amp;C 6:7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs I say, hearing those voices in unison say those inspired words, moved me deeply inside.  I\nwas so thrilled that young people could stand and say and believe that \"he that hath eternal\nlife is rich.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhen my wife and I were in South America recently, we had the same kind of thrill because\nthere we saw your sons and daughters, sometimes under difficult and even adverse\ncircumstances standing in the glory of their young manhood and womanhood, in the glory of their\nmembership in this Church,  in the glory of being missionaries for the Son of God, speak in\nlanguages previously unknown to them, bearing testimony of the restoration of the gospel of\nChrist.  Oh, how happy we were! How humble we felt in their presence, and again came to us\nthis great conviction that the youth of Zion are a great people.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I reflect upon the youth of Zion, I reflect also upon the homes from which they come.  I\nknow that great homes produce great people.  Those homes need not be rich in this world's\ngoods, but if they are rich in the wisdom of God, they are rich indeed, and young people who\ngrow up in homes such as those are great young people.\n<\/p><p>\nYou recall that the Savior at one time said: \". . . every good tree bringeth forth good fruit\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34696\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34696)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34696)\">Matt. 7:17<\/a><\/span>).\nI know that even from a good tree occasionally a piece of fruit may fall, and as\nthe prodigal go the way of all the earth, but that does not change the great underlying fact\nthat \"every good tree bringeth forth good fruit.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAs I have studied your young people and mine, I have come to the conclusion that they are\ngreat because by and large they come from great homes.  It has been my observation that\nwhere young people are active in the Church, as a general rule they come from homes where\nparents also are active in the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, there are some exceptions, I know, but I say as a general rule great homes produce\ngreat young people. Parents who are active in the Church usually produce children who are\nactive in the Church, again proving the truth of the Savior's words that \"every good tree\nbringeth forth good fruit.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBut I would like to read to you the rest of the Savior's words in that quotation.  He said:\n\"Every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34697\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34697)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34697)\">Matt. 7:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow what about the meaning of those words?  Do homes which are not classed as good\nhomes produce evil young people?  And if they do, who must bear the blame?\n<\/p><p>\nThere have been many public opinion polls taken in the United States, as you know, and I\nsuppose they have touched almost every subject under the sun.  There is not very much left\nuncovered by the time they get through.\n<\/p><p>\nI have been shocked and astonished at one of these public opinion polls which indicates that\nthere is a higher percentage of drinkers of alcoholic beverages in the age group of fifteen to\nthirty years than in any other age group. This particular poll indicated that sixty-seven percent\nof American young people from fifteen to thirty years of age use alcoholic beverages\noccasionally or more or less regularly.\n<\/p><p>\nNow these studies, and others, tell us where these young people learn to drink.  Again I was\nastonished to learn that the majority of the American young people who drink liquor learn to\ndrink from their own parents.\n<\/p><p>\nA number of studies, as I say, have been made on this subject, some of them among college\nstudents, some among high school students, and even some elementary students have been\nbrought into the study.  One of the studies having to do with college students indicated that\neighty-five percent of the drinking students have drinking parents.  This same study, which\nincluded information on students who abstain from the use of liquor, said that seventy-seven\npercent of the students who abstain from the use of liquor have both parents who abstain from\nthe use of liquor.  Isn't that a great lesson?  The majority of the drinking students drink\nbecause their parents drink.  The majority of the abstaining students have parents who abstain.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of these studies was conducted in the state of Idaho by the department of social studies\nof the University of Idaho, and the figures sustain the general results as obtained in other\nstudies in eastern United States.  They found that the drinking habits of students follow\nalmost exactly the drinking habits of parents.  I quote just one line from their report: \n<\/p><p>\n\"The proportions of students who drank are approximately equal to the proportions of parents\nwho drank with the knowledge of the students.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn eastern United States a study was made along the same lines.  After the completion of the\nsurvey those who conducted it reported: \"It certainly is not surprising to find a tendency for\nstudents to follow the example of their parents in deciding whether or not to drink.\"\n<\/p><p>\nDr. Andrew C. Ivy, head of the department of clinical science at the University of Illinois,\nrecently wrote an article in the magazine, <i>Life and Health<\/i>, entitled, \"Why I Don't Drink.\" He\ncommented on the fact that there are over sixty million drinkers in the United States, and after\ndiscussing that horrible fact, asked this question: \"Who can save future citizens from drink?\"\nHe answered, \"The fathers and mothers of today's children.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then he said this: \"Children, teenagers, and college students drink and do other things\nthat harm their bodies, characters, and lives largely because their parents do.  If we are going\nto reverse the trend to moral decline and degeneration in our country, mothers as well as\nfathers are going to have to correct their own irresponsible behavior.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe goes on to say, \"The question for parents to answer is: 'Has drinking alcoholic beverages\ncontributed so much to my happiness that I want my child and all children to take the one in\ntwenty chance of becoming an alcoholic?'\"\n<\/p><p>\nThen he said, \"Seventy percent of the chronic alcoholics in the United States started drinking\nas teenagers.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn studies that have been made with regard to smoking habits, the same type of thing has been\ndeveloped.  It is discovered that by and large smoking parents have smoking children, and\nabstaining parents, by and large, have abstaining children.  The same thing is true with\nChurch activity, as I have already indicated.  If parents reject religious activity, their children\ngenerally reject religious activity. If, on the other hand, as we have points out, parents are\nactive and enthusiastic and faithful about their Church responsibilities, as a rule the children\nlikewise are active.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so we may reach some definite conclusions and say that where parents smoke they can\nexpect their children to smoke.  Where parents drink, they may expect their children to drink.\nWhere parents deny religious activity and interest, they can expect their children to deny\nreligious interest.\n<\/p><p>\nNow these same studies have gone into the questions: Why do people drink?  Why do people\nsmoke?  I do not know anybody, with his eyes open, who would suppose that drinking would\ndo him any good, or that smoking would do him any good.  Even the merchants of these\ncommodities are now changing the claims in some advertising that they are good for a person.\nI remember there was a time when they used to advertise that smoking was good for\ndigestion, but they do not any more since the doctors have discovered that tobacco is one of\nthe very worst things for your stomach, and that whether you smoke or chew the tobacco, you\ncan get stomach ulcers from it, and you can develop cancer of the stomach from the ulcers. \nSo tobacco companies have stopped advertising about how good for your digestion it is if you\nsmoke cigarettes.\n<\/p><p>\nWhy do people smoke, and why do they drink?  According to these surveys, it is because\nthey think it is smart. They think it is popular.  They think it is the thing to do because the\nJoneses and others they happen to know and regard as smart also smoke or drink. For that\nreason they think they should take up the habit, and because parents who are blinded by this\nfalse notion of popularity lead their children, who are blinded by the bad example of their\nparents, they both fall into the ditch.\n<\/p><p>\nSo we can begin to see the truth in the Savior's words, can't we, that a corrupt tree will bring\nforth evil fruit.  I ask you parents if you have the right to gamble with the future lives and\nhappiness of your children.  If we set our children an example which is almost sure to lead to\nfailure, what is our responsibility? If we should lead our own children into disaster, would we\never forgive ourselves?\n<\/p><p>\nTwo weeks ago Brother [Delbert L.] Stapley and I happened to have the privilege of being in\nthe same conference together. Brother Stapley there delivered one of his wonderful talks, and\nin his discussion gave me a new point of view on an old subject, and with his permission I\nwould like to mention it here.\n<\/p><p>\nBrother Stapley was talking about the fact that children cannot be tempted by the devil before\nthey are eight years of age because the Lord has not given Satan that right\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13363\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13363)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13363)\">D&amp;C 29:47<\/a><\/span>). Just suppose that\nthere was a basketball game, and for eight minutes one of the teams was ruled off the floor\nwhile the remaining team stayed in there and pitched as many baskets as it could for eight\nminutes, and every basket would count.  Just think about that.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd suppose there was a football game in which one of the teams was ruled off the field\nwhile the other made touchdowns for eight minutes, and every touchdown would count, and it\ncould make these touchdowns without any opposition from the other team.  Just think what\nkind of score it could develop!\n<\/p><p>\nYou do not get that in athletics, but you do get it in the rearing of your children because\nduring the first eight years of their lives, Satan has no right and no power to tempt those\nchildren. If they are tempted, if they sin, you have to blame somebody else besides Satan. \nDuring those first eight years you are left in the field without the opposition of Satan in the\ntraining of your children.  For eight years you can train them, mold their characters, develop\ntheir faith, and teach them to pray, and to love God, and to keep his commandments, without\nany interference or any opposition from Satan.\n<\/p><p>\nHave you ever thought of it that way?  I hadn't until Brother Stapley mentioned it, but I was\nglad he did because, as I say, it gave me a new point of view. The first eight years of a\nchild's life in a Latter-day Saint home form the golden age for parents in the rearing of their\nchildren&mdash;a golden age when Mother and Father may set them the proper example, and play\nwith them, and pray with them, and enjoy them, and develop Christlike traits of character in\ntheir children without the opposition of Satan.\n<\/p><p>\nHave you that kind of home?  In your home are you setting up the circumstances and the\nsurroundings whereby those children can get the most out of this golden age?  Are you doing\nall you can while you do not have the interference of Satan to train those children?  Or, on\nthe other hand, are you careless enough so that you tempt your own children, so that you will\nlead them into paths of sin, so that you teach them by your own bad example how to do things  of the\nworld?\n<\/p><p>\nWell, I come back again to the Savior's words: \". . . every good tree bringeth forth good\nfruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34698\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34698)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34698)\">Matt. 7:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMay our homes be good homes, from which we may send good young people, trained and\nreared in the gospel of Christ, is my humble prayer, in his holy name.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
