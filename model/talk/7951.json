The Savior taught this principle and how we should be reminded and strengthened to follow it when He instituted the ordinance of the sacrament (communion, as others call it). We know from modern revelation that He commanded His followers to partake of the emblems in remembrance of Him (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"124238\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124238)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124238)\">Joseph Smith Translation, Matthew 26:22<\/a><\/span> [in Matthew 26:26, footnote <span class=\"emphasis\">c<\/span>], <span class=\"citation\" id=\"124528\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124528)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124528)\">24<\/a><\/span> [in the Bible appendix]; <span class=\"citation\" id=\"124239\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 124239)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(124239)\">Joseph Smith Translation, Mark 14:21\u201324<\/a><\/span> [in the Bible appendix]).
