When I was asked to do this, I asked myself, \u201cWhy me?\u201d I felt kind of scared. Then in my seminary class a girl gave a thought for opening devotional. She asked, \u201cDo you find difficulties in opportunities or opportunities in difficulties?\u201d I thought about this, and now I\u2019m here!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/a-righteous-choice.p5\" class=\"\">I moved from Samoa to the United States last summer. I didn\u2019t want to leave my island and my friends. Going to a new high school made me very nervous. In spite of being new, I tried out for the girls\u2019 basketball team. I made it! I love basketball! As you\u2019re running down that court, everyone is counting on you to make that basket. When you make it, a feeling of happiness comes to you, and if you don\u2019t make it\u2014well, that is a whole different story!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/a-righteous-choice.p6\" class=\"\">Anyway, I was on the team and couldn\u2019t go to seminary because I had practice every day after school, and I had seminary after school as well. I missed seminary for the whole second quarter and forgot all about it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/a-righteous-choice.p7\" class=\"\">One day my mom asked me about it. I told her that everything was OK. But she knew what was going on. My seminary teacher had sent her a letter. She told me: \u201cFono, you know that what you are doing is wrong. I\u2019m just going to advise you, but it is your decision. Remember, your decision can give you happiness, and it can also put you into a lot of misery.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/a-righteous-choice.p8\" class=\"\">I thought about this for several weeks and came to my final decision. I decided to quit basketball and go to seminary. I knew that if I chose basketball over seminary it would be pretty sad and embarrassing at seminary graduation. I didn\u2019t want to watch others graduate when I couldn\u2019t. Maybe that was the misery my mom was talking about. I decided that I should get my priorities straight. Even though I love basketball so much, first things first. I am hoping to make the basketball team next year. As I plan my schedule, I am making sure that I won\u2019t have to drop seminary again in order to practice.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/a-righteous-choice.p9\" class=\"\">Right now I\u2019m back in seminary. I have a great teacher, a fun class, and I\u2019m very proud of myself for making the right decision. This experience reminds me of a scripture found in Matthew 6:33 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37714\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37714)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37714)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>]: \u201cBut seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/a-righteous-choice.p10\" class=\"\">In my native language, I would like to bear my testimony. [Sister Lavatai then spoke the italicized text in Samoan.] <span class=\"emphasis\">I know this Church is true. Its doctrines are true. I am grateful for this Young Women program, for it has taught us many things to improve our lives.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/a-righteous-choice.p11\" class=\"\">I know this gospel is true.
