In her ward was a young woman named Sandra who had suffered an injury at birth, resulting in her being somewhat mentally handicapped. Sandra longed to be included with the other girls, but she looked handicapped. She acted handicapped. Her clothing was always ill fitting. She sometimes made inappropriate comments. Although Sandra attended their Mutual activities, it was always the responsibility of the teacher to keep her company and to try to make her feel welcome and valued, since the girls did not.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/may-you-have-courage.p23\" class=\"\">Then something happened: a new girl of the same age moved into the ward. Nancy was a cute, redheaded, self-confident, popular girl who fit in easily. All the girls wanted to be her friend, but Nancy didn\u2019t limit her friendships. In fact, she went out of her way to befriend Sandra and to make certain she always felt included in everything. Nancy seemed to genuinely <span class=\"emphasis\">like<\/span> Sandra.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/may-you-have-courage.p24\" class=\"\">Of course the other girls took note and began wondering why <span class=\"emphasis\">they<\/span> hadn\u2019t ever befriended Sandra. It now seemed not only acceptable but desirable. Eventually they began to realize what Nancy, by her example, was teaching them: that Sandra was a valuable daughter of our Heavenly Father, that she had a contribution to make, and that she deserved to be treated with love and kindness and positive attention.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/may-you-have-courage.p25\" class=\"\">By the time Nancy and her family moved from the neighborhood a year or so later, Sandra was a permanent part of the group of young women.
