And I have been impressed with the emphasis that has been laid upon the\nprophecy of Daniel which foretold the setting up of the kingdom of God, the overcoming of\nall other kingdoms, and that this kingdom was to stand forever\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10646\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10646)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10646)\">Dan. 2:44<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a striking and interesting difference between this dispensation and all other\ndispensations. All other dispensations have faded away in a comparatively short time into\napostasy. This is the only dispensation from the beginning that is not to follow that pattern.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Lord Jesus Christ came to perform his glorious mission in the world and established\nhis Church, he established it among an apostate people who, if they had believed the\nteachings of their prophets, would have received him as their Messiah. But they crucified him,\nso it makes a great difference with us in our attitude and in our objectives and in our mission\nin the world.\n<\/p><p>\nThe statistics given this morning were interesting. We now number over a million and a half\npeople. Some experts have estimated the future growth of the Church, and they estimate upon\nrecognized principles of such estimations, that in the year 2000, forty-one years from now, the\npopulation of the Church will be (I must refer to the figures because I could hardly believe\nthem) six million people, and I see no reason why we should not expect that to be so.\n<\/p><p>\nSo we see with regard to our mission to the world and with regard to our relation to the\nworld, not a fading out gospel dispensation, but a gospel dispensation that is to build and\nbuild until the Lord Jesus Christ shall come. He shall not come to an apostate group of Israel,\nbut he shall come to the millions and millions of Israel who shall be gathered into his Church\nand kingdom. This Church and kingdom has already been established in the earth, and this is\nthat kingdom. And testimonies of God's servants have been borne to that fact for one hundred\nand twenty-nine years and will continue to be borne to that fact to the end.\n<\/p><p>\nWe say that in love and consideration for our fellow men, but it is our duty to declare that\nfact, that this is the kingdom of God established by the Lord Jesus Christ and that its mission\nis to fill the earth until the Lord Jesus Christ shall come. And we must bear that testimony,\nand we must bear the responsibilities that attach to that testimony. Our lives and all that we\nhave and are should be devoted to the upbuilding of this great kingdom preparatory for our\nLord and Savior to come and reign in the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nAnother striking thing that is different in this dispensation from any other dispensation, is that\nthere is involved the overcoming of the powers of evil in the earth; there is\ninvolved the overcoming and the ending of all nations in the earth; and the Lord has declared\nthat the time will soon come when peace will be taken from the earth, and the devil will reign\nin his dominion and that the Lord Jesus Christ will reign among his Saints\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13707\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13707)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13707)\">D&amp;C 1:35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo we are living in that great dispensation when the culmination of all the history of the\nworld and the work of God among the children of men, up to the time of the millennium, will\nbe brought to pass.\n<\/p><p>\nThese great changes in nations cannot be brought to pass without great political upheaval,\nwithout wars and calamities that the scriptures make very plain will come.\n<\/p><p>\nBut bear in mind that the Lord is directing this world. We are frequently reminded that\nconditions have been so developed in the powers of warfare that an accident or a rash move\ncould set in operation those powers which might destroy our civilization. But let us bear in\nmind that this world is in the hands of God. All these things will happen only so far as they\nare in accordance with his plans and his purposes. And let us not waste our time and our\nenergy and get into a nervous condition about what is going to happen to the world. That is\nnot our sphere of responsibility. The Lord will take care of that. It remains for us to be\ndevoted to the upbuilding of his kingdom and facing whatever conditions may come to us.\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to read what the Lord has said about that in just a few words, for he has\npromised that this land that he established in the beginning for a special purpose&mdash;that Israel\nshould accomplish its destiny in the world&mdash;bringing gospel truth to the world&mdash;is a special\nland, not only a promised land but also a protected land, and the Lord will protect this land\nagainst the enemies of righteousness. It is for us to be faithful and for all the people of this\nland, not just the members of this Church, to be true to its Constitution and to be true to Jesus\nChrist, the God of this land (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22213\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22213)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22213)\">Ether 2:12<\/a><\/span>).\nThose are the things that we need to worry about.\nThose are the things that we need to center our hearts upon. The Lord has said that he\nplanned this land to be choice above all other lands for the blessings to come to Israel. He\nalso said in exact words: \"I established the Constitution of this land,\" saying that it was done\nto preserve our liberties (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13786\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13786)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13786)\">D&amp;C 101:80<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the Lord brought about the discovery of this land as a preliminary arrangement for the\nestablishment of his kingdom. This land has been occupied by the blood of Israel from the\nbeginning, hidden by thousands of miles of ocean from any other group and has produced its\nscriptures and its prophets and has borne witness to the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nNow, this land will be protected, and the cause of God will be protected. It is for us to devote\nourselves with all our hearts to the building up of this kingdom and preserve peace in our\nhearts and not give way to the weakening influences that would come from any other attitude.\nThe Lord says: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I, the Lord am angry with the wicked; I am holding my Spirit from the inhabitants of the\nearth.<br \/>\n\"I have sworn in my wrath, and decreed wars upon the face of the earth, and the wicked shall\nslay the wicked, and fear shall come upon every man;<br \/>\n\"And the saints also shall hardly escape; nevertheless, I, the Lord, am with them, and will\ncome down in heaven from the presence of my Father and consume the wicked with\nunquenchable fire\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13749\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13749)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13749)\">D&amp;C 63:32-34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has also declared that any powers and forces that fight against Israel and against\nZion shall be destroyed.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For I, the Lord, have put forth my hand to exert the powers of heaven; ye cannot see it now,\nyet a little while and ye shall see it, and know that I am, and that I will come and reign with\nmy people\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13772\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13772)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13772)\">D&amp;C 84:119<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion, for all flesh is in mine hands; be\nstill and know that I am God.<br \/>\n\"Zion shall not be moved out of her place, notwithstanding her children are scattered\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13784\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13784)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13784)\">D&amp;C 101:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"For I, the Lord, rule in the heavens above, and among the armies of the earth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13748\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13748)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13748)\">D&amp;C 60:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLet us with all our hearts build up the kingdom of God, for the time is coming when gross\nwickedness and corruption will be swept from the earth God has restored his gospel. It is\nbeing preached to all the world, so that as many as possible will forsake wickedness and join\nthe people of God and become the seed of Israel, the sons of Abraham, the followers of and\nbelievers in Jesus Christ the Redeemer of the world. After that, those others who will not do\nthat may have to be swept away as they war one with another and fall into the pits that they\ndig for others.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear my humble witness that this Church is the Church of Jesus Christ, the Creator and\nRedeemer of the world, that he has set it up through the Prophet Joseph Smith, a prophet of\nthe Living God, and that it is being conducted by the servant of God, David O. McKay, our\nbeloved prophet and leader. And I call the attention of the people of the world and the Saints\nto the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13701\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13701)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13701)\">D&amp;C 1:1-39<\/a><\/span>)\nwhich is a formal proclamation to all\npeoples by the Lord God himself, declaring that he has restored the gospel to the world and\nset up his kingdom and that his voice calls out to all the world to repent and enter into that\nkingdom and listen to the voice of his servants and disciples whom he has raised up in these\nlast days.\n<\/p><p>\nThis work is the work of God. I bear this humble witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
