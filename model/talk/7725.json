When our hearts turn to our ancestors, something changes inside us. We feel part of something greater than ourselves. Our inborn yearnings for family connections are fulfilled when we are linked to our ancestors through sacred ordinances of the temple.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/generations-linked-in-love.p15\" class=\"\">Because of the importance of this work, the Church has built temples closer to the people,<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-09205_000_036\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[President Thomas\u00a0S.

Gone are the days when this sacred work was done only by specialists. No matter your situation, you can make family history a part of your life right now. Primary children can draw a family tree. Youth can participate in proxy baptisms. They can also help the older generation work with computers. Parents can relate stories of their lives to their posterity.

In the past, a person worked separately, keeping his or her own family records. One often worked without knowing what other family members were doing. Now each person can contribute information while coordinating with others in developing their family tree.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/generations-linked-in-love.p23\" class=\"\">While the new FamilySearch is a giant step forward, it is still just a step. There is more work ahead. Because the system facilitates access to information submitted to the Church over many decades from many sources, new FamilySearch may expose duplicate entries or errors that had not previously been recognized. This feature is especially useful for those with early pioneer ancestry. Duplications and errors need correction, and no one can do it better than each individual for his or her own family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/generations-linked-in-love.p24\" class=\"\">You may be frustrated as you work through these challenges.

This is an enormous endeavor with enormous rewards.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/05\/generations-linked-in-love.p25\" class=\"\">This is joyful work.
