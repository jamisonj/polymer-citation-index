I, God, created man in mine own image, in the image of mine Only Begotten created I\nhim: male and female created I them\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39092\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39092)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39092)\">Moses 2:27<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27745\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27745)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27745)\">John 20:17<\/a><\/span>),\nsaid Jesus to the sorrowing Mary.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Apostle Paul declared:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . in Him [God] we live, and move, and have our being . . . For we are also His offspring\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7804\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7804)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7804)\">Acts 17:28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe destiny of man, which is to rise from the grave in resurrection to live forever, has also\nbeen revealed, as has the fact that as a son of God he is endowed with the potential to reach\nthe perfection of his Heavenly Father, provided he successfully passes the test of mortality.\n<\/p><p>\nThe scriptures further reveal that God, having placed us in mortality to meet this test, did not\nleave us in ignorance, confusion and despair to find our way by chance, but that from the\nvery beginning He has made known for our benefit the gospel of\nJesus Christ, His divine plan for our salvation and exaltation. These great, basic truths were\ngiven by revelation which came \". . . not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God\nspake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4847\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4847)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4847)\">2 Pet. 1:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow I am painfully aware that Christianity does not today evidence a uniform understanding\nof the foregoing basic doctrines. The scores of churches with their varied creeds and different\ninterpretations seem to lead away from, rather than toward, that glorious consummation\nforeshadowed by Paul when all shall \". . . come in the unity of the faith\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21695\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21695)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21695)\">Eph. 4:13<\/a><\/span>). This\nconfusion, tragic as it is, does not however, disprove the thesis that the doctrines came by\nrevelation and declare the word of God. What it proves is that the conflicting interpretations\nof these basic revelations are being made in the feeble, flickering light of man's wisdom. This\nnaturally brings confusion, because the things of God cannot be understood through the\nlearning of men. You will recall how Paul pressed this point.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Eye hath not seen, not ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things\nwhich God hath prepared for them that love him.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThat is to say, the things of God cannot be comprehended through the natural senses of man.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But,\" he continues, \"God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all\nthings, yea, the deep things of God.<br \/>\n\"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so\nthe things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"288\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 288)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(288)\">1 Cor. 2:9-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow if this doctrine of Paul's be true, and we witness that it is true, there must be personal\nrevelation, that is, revelation to individuals, by which they may understand the basic\nrevelations and receive soul-satisfying confirmation as to their divinity. That there is such a\n\"Voice of the Spirit,\" the scriptures clearly affirm.\n<\/p><p>\nFor example:\n<\/p><p>\n\"When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom\ndo men say that I the Son of man am?<br \/>\n\"And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or\none of the prophets.<br \/>\n\"He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?<br \/>\n\"And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.<br \/>\n\"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood\nhath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34829\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34829)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34829)\">Matt. 16:13-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHere the Redeemer Himself declares that Peter received from His Father in Heaven by revelation the\nknowledge that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God. Why did not the others know\nwho He was? They who said he was John the Baptist, Elias, Jeremias, or some other of the\nprophets, why did they not know the identity of Jesus? Obviously, it was because His identity\nhad not been revealed to them by \"the Voice of the Spirit\" as it had been to Peter. Until it\nwas so revealed they could not know Him, for \". . . no man can . . . [know] that Jesus is the Lord,\nbut by the Holy Ghost\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"289\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 289)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(289)\">1 Cor. 12:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat this \"Voice of the Spirit\" is available to all who will receive it, is apparent from the\nuniversal call and promise of Jesus.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,\" He said, \"and I will give you rest\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34828\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34828)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34828)\">Matt. 11:28<\/a><\/span>). And again:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34820\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34820)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34820)\">Matt. 5:6<\/a><\/span>)\nwith the Holy Ghost\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5573\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5573)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5573)\">3 Ne. 12:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSince God has revealed all things essential for man's guidance through mortality to his\nglorious destiny, and has provided that men individually by the \"Voice of the Spirit\" may\nreceive personal revelation to enlighten their understandings and confirm to them the truth of\nGod's revealed word, the all-important question arises, \"How can we individually attune our\nears to that Voice, so indispensable to our comprehension and appreciation of these things so\nvital to our eternal lives?\"\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the scriptures we draw the answer: first, prayerfully search the\nscriptures, and second, obey the commandments therein written.\n<\/p><p>\nNo principle of the Gospel is more clearly taught than that God will reward the sincere\nseeker. It was Jesus Himself who, in the following words, gave specific assurance that such\nreward includes the gift of the Spirit.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto\nyou,\" He said.\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . For everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it\nshall be opened.\"\n<\/p><p>\nTo emphasize this important truth, He put the following question and added the conclusion:\n<\/p><p>\n\"If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask\na fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?<br \/>\n\"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall\nyour heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31455\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31455)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31455)\">Luke 11:9-11,13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs to searching the scriptures, you will remember that to them who sought His life because\nHe said, \"that God was his Father,\" Jesus declared, \"Ye have neither heard his voice . . . nor seen\nHis shape. And ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom he hath sent, him ye believe\nnot.\" Then He told them that if they would learn of Him, they should, \"Search the scriptures;\nfor in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.\" Continuing\nHe pointed out that a search of the scriptures would reveal to them that Moses himself, whom\nthey professed to believe, would condemn them for rejecting Him. \"For,\" He concluded, \"he\nwrote of me\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27723\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27723)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27723)\">John 5:1-47<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLuke commends the Jews of Berea as being, \". . . more noble than those in\nThessalonica . . . [because they] searched the scriptures daily . . .\" whether the word of God was\nso. As a result, \"many of them believed\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7803\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7803)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7803)\">Acts 17:10-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIf we will add to our prayerful searching of the scriptures, obedience to the commandments\ntherein revealed, we shall assuredly obtain \"the Voice of the Spirit.\" For Jesus said, \". . . My\ndoctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the\ndoctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27742\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27742)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27742)\">John 17:16-17<\/a><\/span>). Now there is\njust one source from which such knowledge can come, and that is from God. And there is just\none way in which it can come, and that is by \"the Voice of the Spirit.\"\n<\/p><p>\nTo the men of Judea and others dwelling at Jerusalem who, pricked in their hearts by the\npowerful witness borne by the Apostles that Jesus was the Christ, cried out, \". . . Men and\nbrethren, what shall we do?\" Peter answered:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of\nsins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br \/>\n\"For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many\nas the Lord our God shall call\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7798\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7798)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7798)\">Acts 2:37-39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn these two short paragraphs, Peter covered three phases of this important matter. He\nspecified two of the commandments which must be obeyed, i.e., repentance and baptism, He\nnamed the chief agent of \"the Voice of the Spirit,\" the Holy Ghost, and he declared the\npromise to be universal.\n<\/p><p>\nNever has the Lord required one of us to rely solely upon the witness of another. This voice\nof the Spirit enabling each individual to know for himself is as much a part of God's plan for\nthe salvation of men as is the principle of free agency. He has endowed His children with\nboth free agency and \"the Voice of the Spirit\" and He puts upon each of them the\nresponsibility for the proper use of these endowments. The Lord has always urged His\nchildren to obtain a knowledge and witness of the truth for themselves.\n<\/p><p>\nIn conclusion I give you my own witness. By \"the Voice of the Spirit\" I have learned and\nknow that the things I have said this day are true. I know that God is a personal being in\nwhose image men are fashioned. I know that He is our Father, that we are His children, that\nas such we are endowed with the potential to eventually come to Him. I know that mortality\nis a necessary phase of our development, that according to the Father's divine plan the earth\nwas created for our habitation, that we were sent here to receive\nphysical bodies and to be tested to see if walking by faith we will keep His commandments.\n<\/p><p>\nI further know that through prayerfully searching the scriptures and through obeying God's\ncommands as therein written, we may individually be led safely through life by \"the Voice of\nthe Spirit\" according to the divine and glorious, soul-satisfying promise that:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth\nevery man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.<br \/>\n\"And [that] every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the\nFather\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13566\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13566)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13566)\">D&amp;C 84:46-47<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod grant that we may all so hearken and be so enlightened through the world, I humbly\npray.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
