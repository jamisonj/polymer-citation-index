To be selected fourth or fifth was not too bad, but to be chosen last and relegated to a remote position in the outfield was downright awful. I know.

Two batters then went down on strikes. Suddenly, the next batter hit a mighty drive. The ball was coming in my direction. Was it beyond my reach? I raced for the spot where I thought the ball would drop, uttered a silent prayer as I ran, and stretched forth my cupped hands. I surprised myself. I caught the ball!

His mission president was none other than John Forres O\u2019Donnal\u2014the man who helped bring to Guatemala the word of the Lord, the leader who on Sunday, March 5, 1989, addressed the throng assembled for regional conference.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/go-for-it.p66\" class=\"\">Forres O\u2019Donnal visited my office not long ago and, in his modest manner, recounted his experience with Randall Ellsworth. He then said to me, \u201cTogether we have witnessed a miracle. I have kept one of the two canes placed upon my desk that day when I challenged Elder Ellsworth to walk without them. I would like you to have the other.\u201d With a friendly smile, he departed the office and returned home to Guatemala.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/go-for-it.p67\" class=\"\">This is the cane given to me. It serves as a silent witness of our Heavenly Father\u2019s ability to hear our prayers and to bless our lives. It is a symbol of faith. It is a reminder of courage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/05\/go-for-it.p68\" class=\"\">Brethren of the priesthood, like the Charles Dickens character Philip Pirrip, we have great expectations. The goal of eternal life awaits. May we strive unflinchingly for its attainment. In the language of the young men assembled tonight, \u201cLet\u2019s go for it!\u201d In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
