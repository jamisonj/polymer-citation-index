Thank you for the efforts you have made in coming here. I pray that when we separate on the morrow, we all will feel that we have been fed the bread of life. I express the same prayer in behalf of those who will receive the conference in their homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p6\" class=\"\">I should like to voice in your behalf a word of appreciation to those who make widely available the facilities of radio, television, and cable. It is a service greatly appreciated by hundreds of thousands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p7\" class=\"\">And now we are expanding the miracle of satellite transmission in behalf of the membership of the Church throughout the United States. With completion of a new uplink facility, tucked away in the hills a few miles to the north of us, the sounds and the sights of this conference are beamed to a transponder 22,300 miles above the equator. There they are amplified and then reflected back to receiving antennas installed in stake centers in various parts of the nation. These centers are now few, but during the next eighteen months these pioneer installations will be expanded to four or five hundred, making it possible for most of the membership of the Church in the United States, either in their homes through conventional radio, television, or cable, or through gatherings in stake centers, to participate in these general conferences.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p8\" class=\"\">With the growth of the Church, we likely could never build a hall large enough to accommodate all who would wish to assemble in one place. Nor would accelerating travel costs make possible their coming. The gifts of science have provided a more convenient way. We are confident that as the work of the Lord expands, he will inspire men to develop the means whereby the membership of the Church, wherever they may be, can be counseled in an intimate and personal way by his chosen prophet. Communication is the sinew that binds the Church as one great family. Between those facilities which are now available and those which are on the horizon, we shall be able to converse one with another according to the needs and circumstances of the time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p9\" class=\"\">Now, I hope you will pardon my speaking in a personal vein for three or four minutes. It was twenty years ago, at the October conference, that I was sustained a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. Previously, for two and a half years, I had served as an Assistant to the Twelve. These have been eventful years, during which four great and inspired men have presided over the Church\u2014David O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, Harold B. Lee, and Spencer W. Kimball. They have been years in which the Church has moved out across the world in a remarkable way. They have been years in which millions of members have been added. They have also been years in which strong voices have been raised against us. We have been criticized, but this criticism has in no way deterred the progress of the work. In fact, it has brought many to our defense and our support, and in some instances it has added to our numbers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p10\" class=\"\">For me personally, these have been challenging years, filled with worrisome responsibility and satisfying experience. Mine has been the opportunity to meet with the Saints over the world. I have been in your homes in many parts of the earth, and I wish to thank you for your kindness and hospitality. I have been in your meetings and listened to your declarations of faith and your expressions of testimony. I have wept with some in your sorrow and rejoiced with many in your accomplishments. My faith has grown, my knowledge has broadened, my love for our Father\u2019s children has strengthened wherever I have gone.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p11\" class=\"\">In recent months I have had the opportunity of traveling in the People\u2019s Republic of China and in the nations of eastern Europe, including Russia. My heart has been touched by the warmth of good people wherever I have gone. All are children of our Father in Heaven. True, there are vast chasms of political and ideological differences. But innately people are the same. They are all sons and daughters of God. They have within their hearts basically the same longings. Husbands love their wives, and wives their husbands. Parents love their children, and children their parents. Their minds respond to the same truths if they are given opportunity to hear them. Speaking of the people generally, they desire peace and not war. They desire brotherhood and not conflict. They desire truth and not propaganda. Ours is a great and compelling responsibility, to teach the everlasting gospel to the peoples of the earth. Many gates are now closed against us. But I am convinced that the Lord in his own time will open them, provided we constantly seek and pray for such openings and are prepared to take advantage of them. I do not know specifically the time frame of the Lord\u2019s work, but I do know that we must be anxiously engaged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p12\" class=\"\">During the twenty years and more that I have served as a General Authority, I have seen in a very personal and intimate way a miraculous opening and strengthening of the work in some of the great nations of Asia. We now have well over a hundred thousand members with strong wards and stakes in lands where only twenty-five years ago we scarcely dreamed of entering. The Lord, moving in his mysterious way, has unlocked those doors and touched the hearts of the people. That process is at work today in other lands. I am convinced of this, although the progress may appear almost imperceptible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p13\" class=\"\">Looking back over these twenty years, I am grateful for the great development of the work of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p14\" class=\"\">And now a new assignment has come. I appreciate the confidence of President Kimball, of Presidents Tanner and Romney, as well as that of my Brethren of the Twelve, the Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric. My only desire is to serve with loyalty wherever I am called. I thank the many of you who have been gracious and generous in your expressions. This sacred calling has made me aware of my weaknesses. If I have offended at any time, I apologize and hope you will forgive me. Whether this assignment be lengthy or brief, I pledge my best effort, given with love and faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p15\" class=\"\">I plead for understanding among our people, for a spirit of tolerance toward one another, and for forgiveness. All of us have far too much to do to waste our time and energies in criticism, faultfinding, or the abuse of others. The Lord has commanded this people, saying: \u201cStrengthen your brethren in all your conversation, in all your prayers, in all your exhortations, and in all your doings.\u201d This is the commandment, stated unequivocally; and then follows this marvelous promise: \u201cAnd behold, and lo, I am with you to bless you and deliver you forever.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"17679\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 17679)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(17679)\">D&amp;C 108:7\u20138<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p16\" class=\"\">Now, if I may be guided by the Spirit, I should like to talk about another matter. There recently spoke in this city a prominent journalist from the East. I did not hear him, but I read the newspaper reports of his remarks. He is quoted as having said, \u201cCertitude is the enemy of religion.\u201d The words attributed to him have stirred within me much reflection. Certitude, which I define as complete and total assurance, is not the enemy of religion. It is of its very essence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p17\" class=\"\">Certitude is certainty. It is conviction.

Great causes were never brought to success by vacillating leaders. The gospel was never expounded to the convincing of others without certainty.

There was no lack of certitude on the part of Paul after he had seen a light and heard a voice while en route to Damascus to persecute the Christians. For more than three decades after that, he devoted his time, his strength, his life to the spreading of the gospel of the resurrected Lord. Without regard for personal comfort or safety, he traveled over the known world of his time, declaring that \u201cneither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cNor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42898\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42898)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42898)\">Rom. 8:38\u201339<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p27\" class=\"\">Executed in Rome, Paul sealed with his death his final testimony of his conviction of the divine sonship of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p28\" class=\"\">So it was with the early Christians, thousands upon thousands of them, who suffered imprisonment, torture, and death rather than recant their stated beliefs in the life and resurrection of the Son of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p29\" class=\"\">Would there ever have been a Reformation without the certitude that drove with boldness such giants as Luther, Huss, Zwingli, and others of their kind?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p30\" class=\"\">As it was anciently, so has it been in modern times. Without certitude on the parts of believers, a religious cause becomes soft, without muscle, without the driving force that would broaden its influence and capture the hearts and affections of men and women. Theology may be argued over, but personal testimony, coupled with performance, cannot be refuted. This gospel dispensation, of which we are the beneficiaries, opened with a glorious vision in which the Father and the Son appeared to the boy Joseph Smith. Having had that experience, the boy recounted it to one of the preachers of the community. He treated the account \u201cwith great contempt, saying it was all of the devil, that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30650\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30650)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30650)\">JS\u2014H 1:21<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p31\" class=\"\">Others took up the cry against him.

I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30651\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30651)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30651)\">JS\u2014H 1:25<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/faith-the-essence-of-true-religion.p32\" class=\"\">There is no lack of certitude in that statement.

I know that God our Eternal Father lives. I know that. I know that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior and Redeemer of mankind, the author of our salvation. I know that this work of which we are a part is the work of God; that this is the Church of Jesus Christ. Great is our opportunity for service therein and strong and certain is our faith concerning it. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
