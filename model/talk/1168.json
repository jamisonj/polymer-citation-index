Brown, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1961, pp. 84-87<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brethren, I think that in a long lifetime of Church service and appearing before\nvarious sized groups, I have never felt more humble than I do tonight as I stand before this\nvast group of men and realize that more than as many as are here are probably listening in\nother places. My feeling of inadequacy is emphasized by the fact that you have asked me to\nassume some duties and responsibilities for which I am not prepared. I therefore lean heavily\ntonight on your sympathy and God's goodness.\n<\/p><p>\nI had made some preparation, having been notified that I would be asked to speak, but I am\nleaving my notes on the chair and shall attempt extemporaneously, with the help of the Lord,\nto emphasize what has been said, though I may not be able to add thereto. Elder Lee and\nElder Evans have given us much to think about. Brother Lee intimated an analogy which I\nshould like for a moment to enlarge upon.\n<\/p><p>\nI do not like to compare the Church to an army, but there are some things that are similar. At\nleast in both organizations we are dealing with human beings, and human beings are pretty\nmuch the same wherever you find them. I am thinking at the moment of an incident in 1912\nwhen the then highest ranking officer in the British Army, came to western Canada to\npromote the organization of what was then known as the militia. He called all the young\nofficers who were in training into a meeting. Among other things, he said to us, and I can\nonly paraphrase: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Gentlemen, a war is coming. In my opinion it cannot be delayed more than two years. It is\ngoing to be the worst war in history thus far, and I am here, to do what I can to prepare the\nnation for what is ahead.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHis prediction, of course, as to the time of the outbreak of the war was accurate, because the\nwar started for Britain in 1914. Subsequent to that time, and on a number of occasions, it was\nmy duty to talk to officers in the army. Always, under instruction from commanding officers,\nmy purpose was, first to acquaint the officers, so far as I could, with the strength and position\nof the enemy; and secondly, to remind the men of their duty and to encourage undeviating\nloyalty; and then to warn them against the methods employed by the enemy\nby subtle infiltration and attempted alienation.\n<\/p><p>\nWe said to these officers, \"Your units will not be stronger than their leaders. You can pretty\nwell judge the strength of any military unit by the quality of its leaders.\" We remind them\nalso that the lives of their men depended upon their efficiency and loyalty.\n<\/p><p>\nTonight we are speaking to perhaps 50,000 men, and every man is a volunteer and qualified\nofficer. Upon each one of you there is great responsibility regardless of where you are\nworking or the size of the group you preside over. Here, as in the army, our strength is going\nto depend in large measure upon the quality of our officers, and our purpose tonight is to\nwarn you priesthood holders, and through you the men and women of your various groups, of\nthe existence, strength, location, and tactics of the enemy, and to remind you that we rely on\nyour absolute loyalty and that preparedness is indispensable.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the army too frequently we refer to fitness as only physical fitness. Tonight we are calling\nupon all of you officers of the Church to be fit and ready, physically, mentally, morally, and\nspiritually, for the war that lies ahead because the enemy is determined to destroy all that we\nhold dear. He is thoroughly organized; he is cunning and ruthless; he is led by men well\ntrained in his type of warfare; and the devil is his commanding officer. Not only must we\nmeet a head-on assault from the enemy, but the more dangerous and subtle attack will be by\ninfiltration, when human termites undertake to undermine our forces. I believe, my brethren,\nthe time has come when every man who holds the priesthood should figuratively stand\nhimself up against the wall and look himself over, ask himself some questions and be honest\nwith his answers. I may say here, you may as well be honest when you are talking to yourself\nbecause the man you are talking to knows who you are and what you are. There are at least\ntwo places when a man will be honest, and that is when he is talking to himself and when he\nis in his closet talking with God Here at least the truth will be distilled.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us then examine ourselves and ask what kind of men we are. We might make a pretty\ngood showing in public, be fairly successful in business or in politics; but let each man ask\nhimself what kind of man are you in the home, in your business, in your private life. If you\ndo not like what you see as you look at yourself, then do something about it because God will\nnot hold any man guiltless who simply confesses his sin and doesn't abandon it, or, who\nadmits his weakness and doesn't work for strength.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I pause here to remind all of us that it matters little what position we hold, but it matters\nmuch what we do in the position we hold. Brother Lee referred to Paul's reminder that there\nis need for all the parts of the body. I am thinking of the Church as the body. No one of us\nshould say or think at any time, \"If I were in some other place, I could display my superior\nability and faith, but just where I am I do not get a chance to show what I can do. If I were a\nbishop or stake president or high councilmen or one of the General Authorities, of course, I\ncould be something great, but down here where I am it doesn't amount to much.\"\n<\/p><p>\nBrethren, when we stand before the Judgment Bar of God&mdash;and I am saying tonight as the\nBritish officer said in 1912, a judgment day is ahead&mdash;when we stand there, I think we will\nnot be asked what position we held in the Church. I think the only question, if any questions\nare necessary, will be, \"What did you do with the job assigned to you?\" And if a counselor in\nan elders' quorum, or a counselor in the bishopric, or a man in any other position anywhere\nin the Church can honestly say, \"I did the best I could to fill the position assigned to me,\" if\nhe can say that honestly, and if one of the General Authorities cannot say it honestly, I would\nrather be the counselor in the elders' quorum, etc., because I think the Lord is not going to\npay much attention to any label one may have on his chest. I don't think the Lord is much\ninterested in labels. He knows as we do that labels do not always tell the truth.\n<\/p><p>\nMy thought tonight, then, is: Brethren, in connection with this program that\nhas been presented to us tonight, let not any of us say, \"Now they are giving us something\nmore to do, more organizations, more committees. Let's join some other church.\"\n<\/p><p>\nPersonally, I thank God for the opportunity to work. I am grateful, among other things, that\nthis, the Church of Jesus Christ, gives opportunity to every man and woman and children as\nwell, incidentally, to participate in the work of the Lord. May I add, there is no position in\nthis Church that is not bigger than the man that holds it as there is room for growth in every\nposition or calling. Every man should be apprised of that and realize that in any position in\nthe Church there is opportunity for any man to employ all the ability with which the Lord has\nblessed him.\n<\/p><p>\nWe come to you tonight to challenge you, to warn you that there is a war now being waged,\nthe most dangerous and devastating&mdash;I am not only speaking of a war with arms&mdash;I am\nspeaking of an ideological war, a spiritual war, a war in which the enemy is endeavoring to\nenslave the bodies and minds and souls of men, and for this we must be prepared.\n<\/p><p>\nLet us be loyal to the stakes and wards, missions and branches to which we have the honor to\nbelong. Let us be true to ourselves and true to our leaders. Again a quick analogy. I saw\ninstances where junior officers criticized senior officers because they stayed far behind the\nlines and did not know what was going on in the trenches. I am speaking of World War I,\nwhich definitely dates me, but I am willing to take that. Very often the junior officers were\ncritical of the senior officers because they did not know there was a rat hole in a dugout,\nforgetful of the fact that the man back there upon whom rested the total responsibility of the\nentire operation had something other to do than to look at a rat hole. He must leave that to\nthe man who happens to be in that dugout.\n<\/p><p>\nAt the head of our force, we have a prophet of God, who is working directly under Jesus the\nChrist, who joined issue with Beelzebub when the foundation of this world was laid, and\nBeelzebub, the devil, Lucifer, declared then that he would never rest until he enslaved the\nsouls of men (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39142\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39142)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39142)\">Moses 4:1-4<\/a><\/span>),\nand Christ declared he would never rest until all were free to \"choose their lives\nand what they'd be.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWe, then, are enlisted in an army with Christ at the head and a living prophet through whom\nhe directs his work. Let us be loyal to them, true to ourselves, and let each of us do the job\nassigned to him in the place where he is asked to work to the best of his ability.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to assure you that I know what it means to be asked to do a job a thousand times too\nbig for me, and yet I know too that God can take any one of us and do anything he wants to\ndo through us. Let us not spend time asking the Lord to do something for us when he is\nwaiting and anxious to do something through us. Let us not forget that the priesthood we bear\nis not in us as individuals, but the power of it comes through us. Let us keep ourselves in\nsuch condition that that power can be transmitted. Let us go forward as President McKay\nadmonished us at the beginning of this conference and be unafraid. May we have courage and\nfortitude and faith and go forward with the knowledge that though we will undoubtedly have\nto meet many difficult things. With God's help we need not fear.\n<\/p><p>\nI like one verse of the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; <br \/>\n     He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat: <br \/>\n     O, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! Be jubilant, my feet!<br \/>\n     Our God is marching on.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;                              (Julia Ward Howe.)\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, my brethren I thank you for your support. I want to tell you from intimate\nassociation that we have at the head of the Church today one of the greatest leaders of the\nDispensation of the Fulness of Times. God has honored him, and we who sit next to him day\nby day see the work of the Church being outlined, organized, and going\nforward under the inspiration of heaven. I testify to you that he is the prophet of God, and\nthat these men who are associated here with us are true and loyal to him.\n<\/p><p>\nI leave you my testimony of the restoration of the gospel, and I want you to know that the\nPresident and all of us have confidence in you, that you will not let us down nor be untrue to\nyourselves nor become traitors to the cause. Furthermore, you may be sure that ultimately\nrighteousness will triumph. Truth will prevail. The Church has been organized and set up. It\nis the kingdom of God, and it will never be thrown down.\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless us to do our part. To this end I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
