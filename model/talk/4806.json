I love to listen to you sing \u201cI Walk by Faith.\u201d I get choked up when I hear that. I see you as good, and I see your great potential.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p5\" class=\"\">Tonight I am going to talk about having faith in your Heavenly Father, about the divine qualities you have inherited, and of your infinite worth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p6\" class=\"\">Although I have faith in you, I know some of you who are feeling insecure, unhappy, lonely, who don\u2019t think you\u2019re as good as your friends, or not as pretty or as important. I want to say, \u201cYou are wonderful! You must not know how good you are. Can\u2019t you see what you have going for you?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p7\" class=\"\">I remember when I was fourteen and had many of those same feelings of doubt and insecurity, and I was wondering what I was to do with my life. My mother would say to me: \u201cYou can be anything in life you want to be, Elaine, if you work for it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p8\" class=\"\">I\u2019m a long way from fourteen, but I\u2019ve learned that she was right. Your life at fourteen or sixteen is much different than mine was. You are living in a computer and space age. I still use a pencil and marvel at a satellite launch. The world is so different, but the principles taught to me by my mother are the same.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p9\" class=\"\">Every Sunday throughout the world young women stand together and repeat the Young Women Theme. You say, \u201cWe are daughters of our Heavenly Father who loves us.\u201d That theme has become part of the creed of my life. I personalize it and say, \u201cI, Elaine Jack; am a daughter of my Heavenly Father who loves me, and I love him.\u201d When I listen to you say it, I recall my feelings at your age. Sometimes I still feel that way. Even though I\u2019m a grandmother, I need assurance that I am somebody. We all need to be reminded that we are daughters of a Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p10\" class=\"\">That eternal truth is so important.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p11\" class=\"\">In Romans 8:16, the Apostle Paul talked about it when he wrote that the Spirit of our Heavenly Father will teach us that we truly are daughters of God. Paul says it this way:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cThe Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42937\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42937)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42937)\">Rom. 8:16<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p13\" class=\"\">A Mia Maid in the Philippines expressed the same thought like this:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cI used to ask myself, \u2018Am I one of the chosen daughters of our Heavenly Father?\u2019 and \u2018Did God create all people?\u2019 These questions prompted me to read the scriptures with the hope of receiving immediate answers. But the answers took long in coming. I became involved in the Young Women organization, and through the promptings of the Holy Ghost, I developed a strong faith that I am indeed a daughter of God, who created all of us.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p15\" class=\"\">I\u2019ve heard some of you say, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have a testimony or not. I\u2019ve never felt the Spirit.\u201d You may not have recognized it, but you probably have. Maybe you\u2019re feeling it right now. Very often it\u2019s the influence of the Spirit that gives you a warm feeling about an experience; it makes a message sound right and true, and sometimes it makes you feel as if you want to cry. Always it brings peace. Listen to a letter from a young woman that a friend shared with me:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cFor the past couple of months I felt like my testimony was starting to slip and that I wasn\u2019t as close to my Heavenly Father as I should be. Then you came and spoke to us. You told us how you prayed every night that you\u2019d have the blessing of the Spirit striving with you, so I decided, \u2018What the heck? It sure couldn\u2019t hurt, right?\u2019 Well, for that first week, every day I felt that Spirit. It really made me feel at peace.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p17\" class=\"\">I, too, have experienced what Paul taught when he said, \u201cThe Spirit beareth witness that we are children of God.\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42938\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42938)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42938)\">Rom. 8:16<\/a><\/span>]<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p18\" class=\"\">When you have that witness, then you know that you are part of God\u2019s family, that Jesus Christ is your elder brother, and that you\u2019ve inherited the characteristics of love, forgiveness, patience, service, tolerance, obedience. Christ is our example. If you wonder about other traits you have inherited, your patriarchal blessing will help you discover individual qualities.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p19\" class=\"\">Our prophet, President Ezra Taft Benson, has counseled:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cI would encourage you young sisters, as you approach your teenage years, to receive a patriarchal blessing. Study it carefully and regard it as personal scripture to you\u2014for that indeed is what it is.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1986, p. 82.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p21\" class=\"\">Have you had a patriarchal blessing? Are you preparing to get one soon? Think of this\u2014what does a patriarchal blessing say? Have you ever heard of one which says, \u201cI am sorry\u2014you\u2019re a loser. Do the best you can on earth, and we\u2019ll see you in about seventy years. \u201cOf course not! And you never will, because of the divine qualities each of God\u2019s children has inherited. A patriarchal blessing is like a road map, a guide, directing you in your walk through life. It identifies your talents and the good things that can be yours.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p22\" class=\"\">In my blessing I\u2019m promised that I can enjoy the gift of foresight, to be able to discern the thoughts of the heart and to detect the powers of evil. Then my responsibility is outlined: \u201cThese gifts you must cultivate, that you may not be deceived.\u201d I received this blessing when I was very young. The circumstances were unusual, but I\u2019m sure that the gifts and blessings that were promised would have been the same if I had been sixteen or thirty-six.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p23\" class=\"\">Have you ever been told you are just like your mother, or you have your father\u2019s smile, or all of your family have the same color of eyes? The physical characteristics that we inherit from our parents are obvious. The spiritual characteristics we inherit from our heavenly parents have to be developed. You have been born with all the godlike gifts that Christ has. They are within you, but you have to choose to cultivate and develop them. Spiritual growth doesn\u2019t just happen without our best efforts. I know you understand this. A young woman writes:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cA girl at school, not as popular, needs help in science. My friends in the higher group tell me to leave her alone or it would ruin my reputation. And then I remembered when I needed a friend and help in math. I put myself in her place. Not only did I help her out, I made a new friend.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p25\" class=\"\">Another young woman in England is developing her gift for being a peacemaker. She says:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cI love making and listening to music, and it is one of the best ways I know to calm down. If I am in a rotten mood, I quite often go to the piano and take out my anger on it. This isn\u2019t very good for the piano, but soon I feel fine again, and usually I will end up playing a hymn. This puts me in a better humour, and everyone else responds to the music as well, so we get harmony in the home for a while at least.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p27\" class=\"\">And a Laurel says:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cI remember how I used to look up to the Laurels and try to emulate them. I fluttered when they spoke to me. When I got older, I realized that younger girls were looking up to me. One of the Beehives was asked to write a paper for school on \u2018The Person I Most Admire.\u2019 She wrote about me! I realized the importance of my influence and my obligation to be a good example.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p29\" class=\"\">What you become might be different from anyone else, but you have a distinct responsibility to grow spiritually and to reach out to others. We are important to Heavenly Father as his children. God will never stop being our Father, but sometimes we turn away from being his children by not obeying his commandments or by showing disrespect for him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p30\" class=\"\">Do you know what <span class=\"emphasis\">infinite<\/span> means? <span class=\"emphasis\">Infinite<\/span> means having no boundaries or limits. \u201cI am of infinite worth with my own divine mission which I will strive to fulfill.\u201d Do you believe that?

He would have you believe, \u201cYou\u2019re no good; why try?\u201d If you have those thoughts, don\u2019t believe them. According to Elder Neal A. Maxwell, \u201cSatan delights to have us put ourselves down. Self-contempt is of Satan. There is no such thing in Heaven.\u201d The scriptures tell us that Satan would have you \u201cbe miserable like unto himself\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4338\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4338)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4338)\">2 Ne. 2:27<\/a><\/span>) and that he \u201cdesireth to have you\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6181\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6181)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6181)\">3 Ne. 18:18<\/a><\/span>).

I wanted help. I needed help. I knew I could get help from Heavenly Father.\u201d In this life, we do make mistakes, but through the process of repentance and the blessings of the Atonement, they can be resolved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p36\" class=\"\">Repentance means turning the heart and the will to God. It denotes a change of mind, a fresh view about God, about oneself, and about the world. (See LDS edition of the King James Bible, Bible Dictionary, p. 760.) It is a cleansing process. It <span class=\"emphasis\">is<\/span> the way back. There is someone who does care and will help. You can choose to wallow in despair or to make the changes that will bring lasting happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p37\" class=\"\">Your confidence becomes stronger as you practice making right choices.

As a popular high-school student, she received a letter from a former neighbor, a girl she termed \u201cunfortunate.\u201d The girl asked for some tips on how to make boys like her. Part of Michelle\u2019s reply was, \u201cJust be yourself, and people\u2014not just boys\u2014will like you for what you are.\u201d Later Michelle received a letter from \u201cher new friend.\u201d (Isn\u2019t that interesting?

The gospel assures you that your value is not dependent on your looks or material possessions. What matters are the beliefs you have in your heart. What my mother taught me was true. When I have worked tirelessly, without giving up at small setbacks, I have progressed toward becoming what I want to be. Part of what it means to be a Latter-day Saint is to know within your soul your eternal worth, who you really are, and why you are here on earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1989\/11\/identity-of-a-young-woman.p41\" class=\"\">Next time you are questioning your identity, remember the divine potential you have been given and the promises you can realize.
