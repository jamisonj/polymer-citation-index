As we sing in unison I can\npicture in my mind the scene before Jericho, when the priesthood of Aaron marched around\nthe walls and blew the trumpets and the walls fell\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30033\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30033)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30033)\">Josh. 6:1-27<\/a><\/span>). God was with Israel and his priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nCRUSADE OF PETER THE HERMIT\n<\/p><p>\nThat incident reminds me that during the great crusade into the Holy Land, known as the\nCrusade of Peter the Hermit, when the crusaders finally reached the walls of Jerusalem, they\ntried to repeat the miracle of Jericho but failed. The crusaders had gone to the Holy Land\nwith a plenary indulgence from the Pope of Rome, which promised every man who went into\nthis crusade forgiveness, as it was popularly understood, for all the crimes he ever had\ncommitted and all that he ever might commit. Their criminal excesses astounded even the\ninfidels.\n<\/p><p>\nThe next day or two after the trial for the miracle, the walls of Jerusalem were stormed and\nthe crusaders entered. The accounts say that as they went up those narrow streets toward\nMount Zion, the blood running down from the men, women, and children who had been\nmassacred, was up to the horses' knees. As the crusaders pushed into the city they took children\nby the heels and dashed out their brains against the walls. Some who were particularly\ndexterous, took children by the heels and tried to throw them over the walls.\n<\/p><p>\nGodfrey, the head of the crusaders, went into the temple and got down on his knees and\nthanked God for this day of achievement, and the representative of the Pope, the papal legate,\nwas heard in the streets thanking God for what had happened. But God refused to give the\npriesthoodless Crusaders the approval he gave to Joshua and his priesthood in the ancient day\nat Jericho.\n<\/p><p>\nPRIESTHOOD AN EVERLASTING ENDOWMENT\n<\/p><p>\nThis body of priesthood here tonight holds the priesthood of the Son of God; it is a holy\npriesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nWe have had much said about the priesthood today and I endorse all of it. Brother Benson\ntalked about it at length this afternoon. Bishop Richards referred to it tonight; President\nMcKay also spoke of it. And I hope they will excuse me if I carry the matter just a little\nfarther.\n<\/p><p>\nThe priesthood is an everlasting endowment. Some, at least, who have come to the earth had\nit before they came here. The Prophet Joseph said: \"Every man who has a calling to minister\nto the inhabitants of the world was ordained to that very purpose in the Grand Council of\nHeaven before the world was. I suppose,\" says he, \"I was ordained to this very office in that\nGrand Council.\" The priesthood of God is from everlasting to everlasting, and the thought that\nI would like to leave with you will be suggested by a number of semi-questions I shall ask.\n<\/p><p>\nPERTINENT QUESTIONS\n<\/p><p>\nDo you know of any way in which you can lay your priesthood aside? Do you suppose that\nafter you get through with this conference you can go home and lay it off like a suit and go\nforward with your avocations without the priesthood? Do you suppose that you can lay your\npriesthood aside if you should wish to do a dishonest thing, and then pick it up again\nafterwards and put it on and go on as if nothing had happened? Can you lay your priesthood\naside while you go into a saloon and take a drink, or when you take a smoke? Can you lay\nyour priesthood aside if you begin an immoral act? Can you lay your priesthood aside if you\nundertake any crime or any transgression?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd to the young men who are here I would like particularly to ask them, do you think you\ncan lay your priesthood aside if you shall undertake to make immoral advances to some girl\nthat you had taken out, or could you lay it aside while you committed, completed the immoral\nact? The priesthood you hold is with you every second of your lives until it is taken from\nyou.\n<\/p><p>\nBut how about honoring it and how about so living that when you have occasion to use its\npowers they are at your command.\n<\/p><p>\nIf a man had given you a commission to do something which required that you walk down\nthe straight and narrow path, do you think you would be honoring that commission if you\nwere to go off on detours, do things that you ought not to do outside of and contrary to your\ncommission?\n<\/p><p>\nOBLIGATION TO HONOR PRIESTHOOD\n<\/p><p>\nThose of us who have been in the temple of course know of the obligations we take there.\nBut there are obligations which are taken by every man who bears the priesthood, from the\noffice of deacon up. Do not dishonor your priesthood, brethren, and do not any of you let\nyour life so shape itself that you will lose the powers which the priesthood gives.\n<\/p><p>\nI return again to the theme that I have always mentioned in these priesthood meetings since I\ncame into the Council, to the question of unity. Brethren, if we could act as united and in\nunison as we can sing and have sung in unison, there is no power that could withstand\nanything that we sought to do in righteousness.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God give us the strength and the power and the will and the desire to honor our\npriesthood, to remember that we cannot lay it aside as a cloak; it is always with us to be\ndishonored and disgraced if we shall so act. May he give to us the will and the determination\nalways so to honor our priesthood, that we may be indeed the agents of our Heavenly Father,\nto perform his will,&mdash;to the end that ultimately righteousness may rule the earth, as it will\nultimately through the priesthood, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
