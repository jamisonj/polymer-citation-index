As the prophet has said, a major purpose of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is to strengthen the home. Home and family are the most important, the most influential institutions of society, educational as well as religious. Teachers, universities, and schools are important. But more important are the homes from which professional teachers come. Classmates are influential. But more influential are the homes from which the classmates come. The restored Church proclaims that the family may be an eternal family. Gospel-centered family living helps us to reach these goals.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/the-home-as-an-educational-institution.p5\" class=\"\">The education received by children in their first two years is vital. The attitudes, the sounds, the quality of speech, the expression experienced, the reverence, kindness, the cruelty demonstrated in these critical years influence the future. The home may not be expert in plasma physics. We leave that to the universities. But it should be expert in teaching true self-identity as a child of God.

People turn to various remedies: to the so-called creative genius, the sword, archaism, futurism, or to Plato\u2019s philosopher king. All these fail, says the record of history as read by Toynbee. And \u201ca single figure arises from the flood and \u2026 fills the whole horizon\u201d (New York: Oxford University Press, 1947, abridgement of vols. 1\u20134, p. 547; see also abridgement of vols. 8\u201310, pp. 376\u201377).
