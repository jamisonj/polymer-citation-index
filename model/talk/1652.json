The Tongan capital, Nuku'alofa, is situated 20 minutes east of the International Date\nLine, thereby giving Tonga the title \"the place where time begins.\" Tongans take delight in\nthe thought that of all the people whom God has created and placed over the expanse of this\nmarvelous world, they are the first to greet the new day, the first to be upon their knees in\nmorning prayer to thank a loving Heavenly Father for his abundant blessings.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The Friendly Islands<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nCaptain James Cook, one of the early explorers of the Pacific, was greatly impressed with the\nfriendliness of these native people. On his charts he designated Tonga as the Friendly Islands.\nHis designation could not have been more descriptive. Tongans are good-humored, polite,\noutgoing, and, above all, friendly.\n<\/p><p>\nPerhaps the Friendly Islands didn't quite live up to their name in the estimation of those first\nMormon missionaries who arrived on the island of Tongatabu July 15, 1891. A full year was\nto transpire before a frame meetinghouse could be erected, a humble and modest school\nopened, and the first new member baptized. Frustration followed frustration until progress\nhalted. After a 20-year lull, the work was recommenced with the establishment of the Tongan\nMission.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Early missionaries<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOnce again, men of faith, called of God, left behind home and family and sailed for Tonga.\nSuccess came more readily, but not without exacting a price. Typhoid fever took its toll.\nToday, six well-kept graves mark the resting place of those who were willing to give all in\nthe cause of truth. The words of the Lord provide a fitting epitaph to their lives and to the\nservice of these early missionaries: \"Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying\nthe foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15150\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15150)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15150)\">D&amp;C 64:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nFrom that small frame school has proceeded the Liahona College and a Church-administered\nschool system, which blesses the lives of the choice youth of the Friendly Islands. Teachers,\nboth Tongan and American, with a common bond of faith, provide not only training for the\nmind, but also preparation for life.\n<\/p><p>\nWell could they say: \n<\/p><p>\n\"We are building in sorrow or joy<br \/>\n     A temple the world may not see; <br \/>\n     Which time cannot mar nor destroy&mdash;<br \/>\n     We build for eternity.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;        (N. B. Sargent, \"Building for Eternity.\")\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Classroom lesson<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nOn a recent visit to Tonga, I witnessed such a building project. Entering a typical classroom, I\nnoticed the rapt attention that the children gave their native instructor. His textbook and theirs\nlay closed upon the desks. In his hand he held a strange-appearing lure fashioned from a\nround stone and large sea shells. This I learned was a <i>maka-feke<\/i> or octopus trap.\n<\/p><p>\nTongan fishermen glide over the reef, paddling their outrigger canoes with one hand and\ndangling the <i>maka-feke<\/i> over the side. Octopuses dash out from their rocky lairs and seize the\nlure, mistaking it for an ocean crab. So tenacious is their grasp and so firm is their instinct\nnot to relinquish the precious prize that fishermen can flip them right into the canoe.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was an easy transition for the teacher to point out to eager and wide-eyed youth that the\nEvil One, even Satan, often fashions a <i>maka-feke<\/i> to ensnare unsuspecting persons and to take\npossession of their destiny.\n<\/p><p>\nBefore some he dangles the <i>maka-feke<\/i> of tobacco with the cunning call, \"This is the way to\nsocial ease.\" He who grasps, like the octopus, finds it difficult to relinquish the bait.\n<\/p><p>\nBefore others he presents the <i>maka-feke<\/i> of alcohol with the chant: \"Here is the way to\nunwind and forget your cares.\" The unsuspecting victim finds himself not carefree, but held\ncaptive.\n<\/p><p>\nThe new morality is a cleverly designed <i>maka-feke<\/i>. In a headlong dash for what they envision\nwill be social acceptance, the weak-willed, deceived by a counterfeit bait, discover not social\nacceptance, but experience social rejection.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Love, a source of strength<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat prompted this inspired teacher to close the traditional textbook and for a brief moment\nteach an unforgettable lesson? Love is the answer&mdash;a love for his students and a genuine\nconcern for their welfare.\n<\/p><p>\nThis same spirit of abiding love and genuine concern has characterized the growth of the\nChurch in Tonga from that humble beginning in 1891, even to the present time.\n<\/p><p>\nToday one in seven Tongans is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nBeautiful chapels dot the landscape. The full program of the Church is pursued in a vigorous\nand successful manner. Just last month, together with Elder Howard W. Hunter, I had the\nprivilege to be a part of the creation of a stake of Zion at Nuku'alofa. We found a prepared\npeople. We discovered that from \"small things\" there had proceeded \"that which is great\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15151\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15151)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15151)\">D&amp;C 64:33<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn their journey to greatness, the Tongans have not neglected nor forgotten a great source of\ntheir strength&mdash;this abiding love and genuine concern one for another.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Faith of Tongans<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nEarlier this year a baby boy was born to the Tongan Mission president and his wife, President\nand Mrs. John H. Groberg. Little John Enoch was their first son, the beloved brother of five\nsisters and the delight of the Tongan members. At first the little one did well, but then came\nillness. Doctors worked their skill, parents exercised their faith, but the baby did not improve.\n<\/p><p>\nLate one evening there came a knock at the door. From the Tongan visitor, President Groberg\nlearned that on every island, in every home, and in every heart, fervent prayer and faithful\nfasting became a united appeal to Almighty God that John Enoch Groberg would live.\nVisiting Tonga at the time, I witnessed this faith. I testify to the result. The cause of the\nillness was discovered; the deterioration was arrested. Today the baby is robust in strength. He\nis a living testimony of the power of prayer and the miracle of love.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Visit to royal palace<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nDuring that same visit to Tonga, I accompanied President Groberg to the royal palace, where\nwe were granted an interview with His Royal Majesty King Tupou IV. Our welcome was\ncordial and most pleasant. At the conclusion of the interview, the prompting of the Holy\nSpirit guided President Groberg as he bore fervent testimony to the king concerning the truth\nof the everlasting gospel and the blessings that it provides the faithful. No more eloquent nor\nmoving words have resounded in those royal chambers. No greater courage have I seen\ndisplayed.\n<\/p><p>\nTo my mind came the apostle Paul's inspired defense before another king, even Agrippa.\nHere in Tonga was one called of God who was \"not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.\"\nHere was uttered a testimony that \"Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that\nshould rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8055\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8055)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8055)\">Acts 26:19,23<\/a><\/span>).\nI could envision King Tupou saying with King Agrippa, \"Almost thou persuadest\nme\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8057\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8057)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8057)\">Acts 26:28<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe exchanged greetings, departed the palace; but I did not, nor will I, forget that experience.\nWhat prompted such courage, such faith, such conviction in a young mission president? The\nanswer: the miracle of love. John H. Groberg loves the Tongan people&mdash;all of them.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Experience of young elder<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs a lad just 20, called to the Tongan Mission, he was assigned to an outer island with a\nnative missionary as his companion. After eight seasick days and sleepless nights on a\nstorm-tossed sea, they reached their destination. Not one soul on the island spoke English.\nHere he acquired his gift of the language. Then came a devastating hurricane that struck the\nisolated island with tropical intensity, destroying the food crop and contaminating the water\nsupply. There was no means of communication with the outside world. The supply boat was\nnot due for almost two months. After four weeks the precious store of food, mainly taro, a\nnative vegetable, was severely rationed. Four additional weeks passed. All food was gone. No\nhelp arrived. Bodies became emaciated, hope dwindled, confidence waned, some died. In\ndesperation, John Groberg waded into the swampland where insects covered his face, and with\na sweep of his hand, many entered his mouth&mdash;his only nourishment.\n<\/p><p>\nThe end drew near. The island's inhabitants sat in an idle stupor. One morning, nine weeks\nfrom the time of the hurricane, John Groberg felt a gentle hand upon his shoulder. He turned\nhis head and gazed into the eyes of an elderly Tongan man. Slowly and with meticulous care,\nthe old man unwrapped a precious prize, even his most treasured possession&mdash;a small can of\nberry jam. He spoke: \"I am old; I think I may die. You are young; you may live. Accept my\ngift.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWhat were the words penned by Charles Dickens? \"It is a far, far better thing that I do than I\nhave ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.\"\n(<i>A Tale of Two Cities<\/i>.) Add to them the declaration of the Savior: \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto\none of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35874\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35874)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35874)\">Matt. 25:40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen came that speck on the horizon and a shout of joy as the supply ship came into view.\nJohn H. Groberg was no longer a boy. His faith had been tried; his life had been spared; his\nlove for the Tongan people was forever assured.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Here am I\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe Holy Scripture records that in the hushed quiet of the still night, the boy Samuel heard\nthe Lord call and answered, \"Here am I\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2577\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2577)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2577)\">1 Sam. 3:4<\/a><\/span>). On the bleak hill of Moriah, Abraham\ndemonstrated his willingness to sacrifice all&mdash;even his only son. He heard the angel of the\nLord call and answered, \"Here am I\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23787\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23787)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23787)\">Gen. 22:11<\/a><\/span>). On the morning of a beautiful spring day\nin a sacred grove at Palmyra, the boy Joseph Smith beheld a heavenly vision and the\nappearance of the Father and the Son. He received his call, and his life demonstrated his\nanswer, \"Here am I.\"\n<\/p><p>\nOn a distant Pacific isle a faithful missionary, John H. Groberg, had answered, \"Here am I.\"\n<\/p><p>\nSo often the call to serve is not accompanied by the sound of a marching band, the cheering\ncrowd, or the applause of those whose favor is deemed so great. Such distractions were not to\nbe found on Damascus' way, in Palmyra's grove, on Moriah's mount, in Gethsemane's\ngarden, nor atop Golgotha's hill.\n<\/p><p>\nWith a never-waning confidence in the people of Tonga, John H. Groberg has taught them not\nto pray for tasks equal to their powers, but rather to pray for powers equal to their tasks. Then\nthe doing of their work shall be no miracle, but they shall be the miracle.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A fond farewell<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI found it difficult last month to bid good-bye to Tonga and its precious people. Here were\nmen of faith, women of patience, even children of promise.\n<\/p><p>\nWe boarded the plane. Slowly it taxied to the grass runway, and with a roar gained speed and\nlifted gently into the blue sky. I looked at the crowd who had bid us farewell. In the distance\nI saw the great school complex. In my memory I thought of the six graves of those early\nmissionaries. Quietly I repeated a verse from Kipling's \"Recessional\": \n<\/p><p>\n\"The tumult and the shouting dies,<br \/>\n     The captains and the kings depart;<br \/>\n     Still stands thine ancient sacrifice,<br \/>\n     An humble and a contrite heart;<br \/>\n     Lord God of hosts, be with us yet,<br \/>\n     Lest we forget, lest we forget.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The miracle of love<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFrom the cabin window I took a last quick glance at Nuku'alofa, which interpreted means\n\"the abode of love.\" I realized that love is not only the miracle of the Friendly Islands; love is\nthe guide to mortal happiness and a requisite for eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nGod so loved the world that he gave his Son (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28406\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28406)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28406)\">John 3:16<\/a><\/span>). The Redeemer so loved mankind that he gave\nhis life. To you and to me he declared, \"A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love\none another; as I have loved you . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28451\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28451)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28451)\">John 13:34-35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWith all my heart I pray that we will be obedient to such a heavenly vision, for I testify it\ncame from the Son of God who is our Redeemer, our mediator with the Father, even Jesus\nChrist, the Lord. Of this I bear witness, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
