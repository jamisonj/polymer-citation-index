That evening, as I approached the building with some of the local leaders, we were surprised to notice that the building was completely dark.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-light-of-the-gospel.p4\" class=\"\">As we entered the building and saw all the members sitting in the chapel, we inquired about the absence of lighting. The bishop informed us that earlier in the afternoon the building supervisor had inspected the building to make sure all was in readiness for the dedication. But now, as the time approached to begin the services, for some reason there were no lights, even though lights were aglow in nearby homes. All possibilities for correcting the problem were checked without success, and so the local leaders and I decided to proceed with the dedicatory services.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-light-of-the-gospel.p5\" class=\"\">As the program proceeded, illuminated only by a kerosene lantern in front of the chapel, I felt sure that this would be the first dedication performed in darkness in the history of the Church!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-light-of-the-gospel.p6\" class=\"\">I\u2019m sure all those good brothers and sisters in the congregation joined me with a silent prayer in their hearts to ask the Lord to bless us with light so that the chapel could be dedicated.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-light-of-the-gospel.p7\" class=\"\">One by one the speakers spoke\u2014in the dark. The choir sang beautiful anthems\u2014in the dark. As the concluding speaker, I, too, gave my talk in the dark. Then, as I asked the congregation to unite with me for the dedicatory prayer, the lights in the chapel suddenly flickered on. How grateful we were to the Lord for this special blessing! I was overcome with emotion and felt meek and humble that we had been so blessed, but the illumination of the chapel could not compare with the light of love in our hearts for this great blessing in answer to our prayers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-light-of-the-gospel.p8\" class=\"\">It brought to mind the words of the prophet Moroni:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-light-of-the-gospel.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-light-of-the-gospel.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cFor if there be no faith among the children of men God can do no miracle among them; wherefore, he showed not himself until after their faith.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22341\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22341)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22341)\">Ether 12:6, 12<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-light-of-the-gospel.p11\" class=\"\">Yes, the Lord blessed us, even as our faith was tested and as we prayed with hope.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-light-of-the-gospel.p12\" class=\"\">There are others among us who search for light in their lives. One such young man had broken many of the laws of the land and had been punished by a prison sentence. He even escaped from prison, only to be caught and reincarcerated a short time later. His was truly a life of darkness and misery, but through the constant efforts of a caring bishop, this young man decided to change his ways and return to Christ. With a meek and lowly heart he began to repent, and the Spirit of the Holy Ghost touched his heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-light-of-the-gospel.p13\" class=\"\">As he prepared to leave prison after serving his term, there to greet him at the gate were his bishop, who had worked with him all those years, and he brought with him his father, mother, brothers, and sisters, who received him with open arms and great rejoicing. What a deep appreciation this young man had for his bishop and his family, who had stood by him even though he had caused them much embarrassment and many sleepless nights with his wayward activities. But their faith never wavered, and indeed a miracle was wrought. Today, this young man serves as the elders quorum president of his ward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/the-light-of-the-gospel.p14\" class=\"\">What great force changed the life of this young man from one of spiritual darkness to one of truth and light?
