I come before you humbly and meekly, saddened by the recent passing of our beloved prophet, President Ezra Taft Benson. My heart is tender upon the passing of my dear friend, particularly in light of the new responsibilities that have come to me.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p4\" class=\"\">I have shed many tears and have sought my Father in Heaven in earnest prayer in the desire to be equal to this high and holy calling. I have prayed to be worthy to bear the assignment which thirteen other men in this dispensation have borne. Perhaps only they, watching from the other side of the veil, can fully understand the weight of responsibility and the deep dependence on the Lord that I feel in accepting this sacred calling.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p5\" class=\"\">My greatest strength through these past months has been my abiding testimony that this is the work of God and not of men. Jesus Christ is the head of this church. He leads it in word and deed. I am honored beyond expression to be called for a season to be an instrument in his hands to preside over his church. But without the knowledge that Christ is the head of the Church, neither I nor any other man could bear the weight of the calling that has come.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p6\" class=\"\">In assuming this responsibility, I acknowledge God\u2019s miraculous hand in my life. He has repeatedly spared my life and restored my strength, has repeatedly brought me back from the edge of eternity, and has allowed me to continue in my mortal ministry for another season. I have wondered on occasion why my life has been spared. But now I have set that question aside and ask only for the faith and prayers of the members of the Church so we can work together, I laboring with you, to fulfill God\u2019s purposes in this season of our lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p7\" class=\"\">I also acknowledge the prayers and faith of my wife and family, my Brethren of the General Authorities, and the multitudes of faithful members who have prayed for me, cared for me, and shown concern for my health.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p8\" class=\"\">It has been thirty-five years since I was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. Those years have been rich in preparation. I have met the Saints and borne testimony in North and South America; in Europe and Eastern Europe; in Asia, Australia, and Africa; and in the islands of the sea. Many times have I been to the Holy Land and walked where Jesus walked. My walk is slower now, but my mind is clear, and my spirit is young.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p9\" class=\"\">As I answer the call from the Lord to lead the Church, I am overcome with gratitude for the revelations which have established the marvelous system by which his church is governed. Each man who is ordained an Apostle and set apart as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve is sustained as a prophet, seer, and revelator. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, called and ordained to hold the keys of the priesthood, have the authority and responsibility to govern the Church, to administer its ordinances, to teach its doctrine, and to establish and maintain its practices.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p10\" class=\"\">When a President of the Church is ill or not able to function fully in all of the duties of his office, his two Counselors, who, with him, comprise a Quorum of the First Presidency, carry on the work of the Presidency. Any major questions, policies, programs, or doctrines are prayerfully considered in council by the Counselors in the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. No decision emanates from the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve without total unanimity among all concerned.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p11\" class=\"\">Following this inspired pattern, the Church will move forward without interruption. The governance of the Church and the exercise of the prophetic gifts will always be vested in those apostolic authorities who hold and exercise all of the keys of the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p12\" class=\"\">I feel just as President Joseph F. Smith felt on a similar occasion many years ago, when he said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cI propose that my counselors and fellow Presidents in the First Presidency shall share with me in the responsibility of every act which I shall perform in this capacity. I do not propose to take the reins in my own hands to do as I please; but I propose to do as my brethren and I agree upon and as the Spirit of the Lord manifests to us. I have always held, and do hold, and trust I always shall hold, that it is wrong for one man to exercise all the authority and power of presidency in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I dare not assume such a responsibility, and I will not, so long as I can have men like these to stand by and counsel with me in the labors we have to perform and in doing all those things that shall tend to the peace, advancement and happiness of the people of God and the building up of Zion.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p14\" class=\"\">President Smith then continued:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cIf at any time my brethren of the Apostleship shall see in me a disposition to depart from this principle or a forgetfulness on my part of this covenant that I make today before this body of Priesthood, I ask them in the name of my Father, that they will come to me, as my brethren, as counselors in the Priesthood, as watchmen on the towers of Zion, and remind me of this covenant and promise which I make to the body of the Church in general conference assembled at this time.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cThe Lord never did intend that one man should have all power, and for that reason He has placed in His Church Presidents, Apostles, High Priests, Seventies, Elders and the various offices of the Lesser Priesthood, all of which are essential in their order and place according to the authority bestowed on them\u201d (in Conference Report, Oct.\u2013Nov. 1901, p. 82).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1994\/11\/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises.p17\" class=\"\">Those words of President Joseph F.
