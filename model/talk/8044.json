Prominent among these today is the strong tide that is legalizing same-sex marriage in many states and provinces in the United States and Canada and many other countries in the world. We also live among some who don\u2019t believe in marriage at all. Some don\u2019t believe in having children. Some oppose any restrictions on pornography or dangerous drugs. Another example\u2014familiar to most believers\u2014is the challenge of living with a nonbelieving spouse or family member or associating with nonbelieving fellow workers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p21\" class=\"\" id=\"p21\">In dedicated spaces, like temples, houses of worship, and our own homes, we should teach the truth and the commandments plainly and thoroughly as we understand them from the plan of salvation revealed in the restored gospel.

The free exercise of religion covers most public actions, but it is subject to qualifications necessary to accommodate the beliefs and practices of others. Laws can prohibit behavior that is generally recognized as wrong or unacceptable, like sexual exploitation, violence, or terrorist behavior, even when done by extremists in the name of religion. Less grievous behaviors, even though unacceptable to some believers, may simply need to be endured if legalized by what a Book of Mormon prophet called \u201cthe voice of the people\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130022\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130022)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130022)\">Mosiah 29:26<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">On the subject of public discourse, we should all follow the gospel teachings to love our neighbor and avoid contention.

In doing so, we ask that others not be offended by our sincere religious beliefs and the free exercise of our religion.

Too often non-Mormons here in Utah have been offended and alienated by some of our members who will not allow their children to be friends with children of other faiths.

The commandment to love one another surely includes love and respect across religious lines and also across racial, cultural, and economic lines.

All of these violate the Savior\u2019s command to love one another.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p29\" class=\"\" id=\"p29\">The Savior taught that contention is a tool of the devil. That surely teaches against some of the current language and practices of politics. Living with policy differences is essential to politics, but policy differences need not involve personal attacks that poison the process of government and punish participants. All of us should banish hateful communications and practice civility for differences of opinion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2014\/11\/saturday-afternoon-session\/loving-others-and-living-with-differences.p30\" class=\"\" id=\"p30\">The most important setting to forgo contention and practice respect for differences is in our homes and family relationships. Differences are inevitable\u2014some minor and some major. As to major differences, suppose a family member is in a cohabitation relationship. That brings two important values into conflict\u2014our love for the family member and our commitment to the commandments.
