The father, by virtue of the priesthood of God that has been bestowed upon him, is the head of that government. This is what constitutes patriarchal office in the family. Originally it was the only government on the earth and was passed down from Adam to his descendants. Eventually, as society became more complex, the manner of governing the people of the earth had to change, but as far as the Church is concerned, the same order exists within the families as God set it up originally with Father Adam. And this same order will extend into the eternities.

This was known as ward teaching.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p12\" class=\"\">In September 1963 home teaching was introduced to the Church. This differs from ward teaching in that greater emphasis is placed on watching over the family, rather than just making a monthly visit. Instructions have been given that the duty of the home teacher is to keep in touch with the families, to watch over them, to contact them in whatever manner necessary, in order to watch over them. We are told that home teaching is not just the one visit a month, but that home teaching is never done. We are to have concern for these families every day as long as they are assigned to us. The one visit a month to a family is important, but it is only one means of contact as we watch over our families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p13\" class=\"\">On the occasion of the official introduction of the home teaching program, President Marion G. Romney suggested some of the challenges and opportunities of home teaching, in these words: \u201cThrough the program of priesthood correlation, we bearers of the priesthood must increase our efforts to encourage, teach, and inspire the Saints to become \u2018partakers of the divine nature,\u2019 \u2026 through obedience to the sanctifying principles of the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cWe are performing far below our potential in this matter. \u2026 Now, priesthood correlation, as we are using the term here, contemplates all that is now being done in ward teaching and much more. It unites under one undertaking many activities. It requires that attention be given to every member of every family, particularly to those who need special encouragement to live the gospel. It means much more than a perfunctory visit once a month. It includes:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p15\" class=\"\">\u201c1.

We are still prodding the priesthood home teachers to \u201churry and get your home teaching done\u2014the month is nearly over.\u201d Even now the home teacher is heard to say, \u201cIf I really had a message to take to my families, I could do my teaching.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p24\" class=\"\">These things indicate we really don\u2019t have the vision of \u201cwatching over the Church.\u201d We might have a great record of percentage of homes visited each month, but the real test is: Are we affecting the lives of the individual members of the family for good through our contacts? Are we respecting the sacred nature of the family unit by working with and through the father? Do we sit down with the father as often as needed? Do we listen to him? Do we encourage and praise and otherwise uplift him?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p25\" class=\"\">Our calling and opportunity as home teachers is to watch over and strengthen fathers of families; the Lord expects fathers and mothers first to teach the gospel to their families in regular family home evenings and daily as teaching opportunities arise.

We know, as home teachers, that the order of the priesthood requires us to work with a family through the presiding authority in the family, the father. The father should be recognized in his position. The Lord holds him responsible for the righteous functions of his family in relation to other church units and for the conducting of his family into eternal life. The home teacher working with and through the father strengthens his role and responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p27\" class=\"\">Our thought as home teachers should always be: How can I help the fathers under my care magnify their priesthood by fully accepting their responsibilities as patriarchs of their families?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p28\" class=\"\">We might put much effort into working with individuals in a family and eventually reach a child, but our real challenge is to work with the father in strengthening him that he might lead the entire family to celestial glory.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p29\" class=\"\">President Joseph F. Smith said, regarding the right of the father: \u201cThere is no higher authority in matters relating to the family organization, and especially when that organization is presided over by one holding the higher Priesthood, than that of the father. \u2026 The patriarchal order is of divine origin and will continue throughout time and eternity. There is then a particular reason why men, women, and children should understand this order and this authority in the household of the people of God, and seek to make it what God intended it to be, a qualification and preparation for the highest exaltation of His children. In the home the presiding authority is always vested in the father, and in all home affairs and family matters there is no other authority paramount.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Juvenile Instructor,<\/span> March 1902, p. 146.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p30\" class=\"\">There is great need for a fresh new look at ourselves as home teachers.

Maybe we ought to be calling them home guardians or sentinels and to report their stewardship to the fathers of the ward. We must do something to change the emphasis from teaching to guardians, \u2018watching over the church kind of concept.\u2019 Until we get that into our minds, we are not going to do the kind of home teaching that is going to get results.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p33\" class=\"\">We need, at once, to catch the spirit of what President Lee has said and become priesthood guardians, priesthood watchmen, rather than teachers of the gospel only. We need to make sure home teachers are not guilty, after having made the one visit a month to each family, of relaxing, feeling good about it, and declaring our home teaching done for the month. Remember, home teaching is never done.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p34\" class=\"\">Brother Rex Reeve, one of the Regional Representatives of the Twelve, gave us some wonderful direction when he said: \u201cPriesthood home teachers must think in terms of needs of the family, not just taking a message. When the priesthood home teacher can see souls\u2014not just another home to visit\u2014and when he can feel the needs of individuals and, in his heart, when he can love them and has a yearning to help, he can give courage to struggling souls as they try to climb homeward in these perilous times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p35\" class=\"\">\u201cPriesthood home teaching is not just another program of the Church, something to get done so you can send the report in. It is a principle of action the vehicle by which all of the programs of the Church are taken to the family and the individual, and, in addition, it has the power to bless and guide and strengthen souls.\u201d (Regional Representatives Seminar, December 12, 1970.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p36\" class=\"\">When stake presidents, bishops, and priesthood leaders generally get the real concept and feeling of home teaching and let it be the vehicle by which all Church programs are taken to the family and the individuals, when families and individuals come to properly recognize and work with the home teachers, we will be able to give a much better account of ourselves in watching over the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/home-teachers-watchmen-over-the-church.p37\" class=\"\">The First Presidency many years ago stated, \u201cThe home [is] the basis of a righteous life and no other instrumentality can take its place or fulfill its essential functions.\u201d (Cited by Elder Harold B.
