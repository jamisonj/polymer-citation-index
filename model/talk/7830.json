We don\u2019t talk about the adversary any more than we have to, and I don\u2019t like talking about him at all, but the experience of young Joseph reminds us of what every man, including every young man, in this audience needs to remember.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/we-are-all-enlisted.p7\" class=\"\">Number one, Satan, or Lucifer, or the father of lies\u2014call him what you will\u2014is real, the very personification of evil. His motives are in every case malicious, and he convulses at the appearance of redeeming light, at the very thought of truth. Number two, he is eternally opposed to the love of God, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, and the work of peace and salvation. He will fight against these whenever and wherever he can. He knows he will be defeated and cast out in the end, but he is determined to take down with him as many others as he possibly can.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/we-are-all-enlisted.p8\" class=\"\">So what are some of the devil\u2019s tactics in this contest when eternal life is at stake? Here again the experience in the Sacred Grove is instructive. Joseph recorded that in an effort to oppose all that lay ahead, Lucifer exerted \u201csuch an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-09611_000_021\">1<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122470\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122470)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122470)\">Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:15<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/we-are-all-enlisted.p9\" class=\"\">As President Boyd\u00a0K.

For you, let me mix in an athletic analogy. This is a life-and-death contest we are in, young men, so I am going to get in your face a little, nose to nose, with just enough fire in my voice to singe your eyebrows a little\u2014the way coaches do when the game is close and victory means everything. And with the game on the line, what this coach is telling you is that to play in this match, some of you have to be more morally clean than you now are. In this battle between good and evil, you cannot play for the adversary whenever temptation comes along and then expect to suit up for the Savior at temple and mission time as if nothing has happened. That, my young friends, you cannot do. God will not be mocked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/we-are-all-enlisted.p12\" class=\"\">So we have a dilemma tonight, you and I. It is that there are thousands of Aaronic Priesthood\u2013age young men already on the records of this Church who constitute our pool of candidates for future missionary service. But the challenge is to have those deacons, teachers, and priests stay active enough and worthy enough to be ordained elders and serve as missionaries. So we need young men already on the team to <span class=\"emphasis\">stay<\/span> on it and stop dribbling out of bounds just when we need you to get in the game and play your hearts out! In almost all athletic contests of which I know, there are lines drawn on the floor or the field within which every participant must stay in order to compete. Well, the Lord has drawn lines of worthiness for those called to labor with Him in this work. No missionary can be unrepentant of sexual transgression or profane language or pornographic indulgence and then expect to challenge others to repent of those very things! You can\u2019t do that. The Spirit will not be with you, and the words will choke in your throat as you speak them.

Whoever you are and whatever you have done, you can be forgiven. Every one of you young men can leave behind any transgression with which you may struggle. It is the miracle of forgiveness; it is the miracle of the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ. But you cannot do it without an active commitment to the gospel, and you cannot do it without repentance where it is needed. I am asking you young men to be active and be clean. If required, I am asking you to <span class=\"emphasis\">get<\/span> active and <span class=\"emphasis\">get<\/span> clean.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/we-are-all-enlisted.p14\" class=\"\">Now, brethren, we speak boldly to you because anything more subtle doesn\u2019t seem to work.

We publicly and proudly salute this group. We know of your desires, and we applaud your devotion. You have our love and our admiration. You are \u201con the team\u201d and you always will be, even as you are honorably excused from full-time service.

I am not through here. We need thousands of more couples serving in the missions of the Church. Every mission president pleads for them. Everywhere they serve, our couples bring a maturity to the work that no number of 19-year-olds, however good they are, can provide.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/we-are-all-enlisted.p20\" class=\"\">To encourage more couples to serve, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve have made one of the boldest and most generous moves seen in missionary work in the last 50 years. In May of this year, priesthood leaders in the field received a notice that housing costs for couples (and we speak <span class=\"emphasis\">only<\/span> of housing costs) would be supplemented by Church missionary funds if the cost exceeds a predetermined amount per month. What a blessing! This is heaven-sent assistance toward the single largest expense our couples face on their missions. The Brethren have also determined that couple missions can be for 6 or 12 months as well as the traditional 18 or 23. In another wonderful gesture, permission is given for couples, at their own expense, to return home briefly for critical family events. And stop worrying that you are going to have to knock on doors or keep the same schedule as the 19-year-olds! We don\u2019t ask you to do that, but we have a host of other things you can do, with a great deal of latitude in how you do them.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2011\/11\/we-are-all-enlisted.p21\" class=\"\">Brethren, for good and sufficient health, family, or economic reasons, some of <span class=\"emphasis\">you,<\/span> we realize, may not be able to go just now or perhaps ever.

Sit on the stand in your meetings and prayerfully look into the congregation for impressions about those who should receive a call. Then counsel with them and help them set a date for service. Brethren, when that happens, tell your wives that if you can leave your recliner and the remote control for a few short months, they can leave the grandchildren. Those little darlings will be just fine, and I promise you will do things for them in the service of the Lord that, worlds without end, you could never do if you stayed home to hover over them.
