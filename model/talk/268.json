Richards, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1946, pp. 137-141<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI have carried in my pocket the manuscript of a talk which I thought I might give should I\nhave the opportunity of speaking in conference, but I have not received the inspiration to use\nit. I have tried to assemble some of my thoughts so as to express them in a way that will be\nof interest to you, my numerous friends, brethren and sisters, and to say a few words upon the\ngreatest thing in the world. I read a book a few years ago entitled The Greatest Thing in the\nWorld, and that thing was love.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE GREAT COMMANDMENT\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior has had something to say upon this subject, and the thought just occurred to me\nthat if he were here in the presence of this large congregation so that we could look upon him\nand hear what he would say, perhaps his words would be more impressive than they have\nbeen to us by reading them in the scriptures.\n<\/p><p>\nA learned man, a lawyer, approached him on one occasion and asked him:\n<\/p><p>\nMaster, which is the great commandment in the law?\n<\/p><p>\nJesus said unto him. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy\nsoul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like\nunto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34099\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34099)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34099)\">Matt. 22:36-39<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nOn another occasion he said:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray\nfor them which despite fully use you, and persecute you\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34044\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34044)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34044)\">Matt. 5:44<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe are also told in the scriptures that we should walk in the light as he, Jesus, was in the\nlight (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1024\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1024)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1024)\">1 Jn. 1:7<\/a><\/span>),\nor, in other words, to follow his example.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen he prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, his perspiration was like blood dropping upon\nthe ground (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31198\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31198)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31198)\">Luke 22:44<\/a><\/span>).\nWe are told, by an angel to King Benjamin, a great Book of Mormon prophet,\nthat blood would ooze from the pores of his body, so great should be his anguish, because of\nthe wickedness and the abominations of his people\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40201\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40201)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40201)\">Mosiah 3:7<\/a><\/span>), occasioned, of course, by the love that he\nhad for the people.\n<\/p><p>\nWe mourn and have anguish of soul if a daughter goes wrong, or a son, because we love\nthem so.\n<\/p><p>\nGOD SO LOVED THE WORLD\n<\/p><p>\nThen we read that,\n<\/p><p>\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in\nhim should not perish, but have everlasting life\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27225\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27225)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27225)\">John 3:16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe also know that the Savior gave himself voluntarily for all; that his atonement meant, in\nlife and in death, a voluntary gift for us, a manifestation of love that has no comparison.\nWhen he was upon the cross in the agonies of death, he turned his thoughts toward his Father\nin heaven and prayed earnestly:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31201\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31201)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31201)\">Luke 23:34<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is the example of the Prophet Stephen, who, when being stoned to death, knelt upon the\nground and prayed God not to lay that sin to the charge of his persecutors\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7563\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7563)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7563)\">Acts 7:60<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLOVE WOULD SOLVE PRESENT DAY PROBLEMS\n<\/p><p>\nIf such love obtained in the world today as the Lord intended that it should, love of God and\nlove of fellow men, there would be no wars, contentions, and strife among the children of\nmen. And that there is such, is due to an indifference by men to heed the admonitions and\nteachings of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nI profess love for you, my brethren, sisters, and friends, my hearers. I hope to be able to\ncomply with the law to the extent that I can love all who hear my voice, whether they be in\nthe Church or out of the Church, whether they be good or bad, whatever their condition of\nlife. They are the children of our Eternal Father; they are our brothers and sisters.\n<\/p><p>\nNo doubt we with them rejoiced and were happy together,\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26646\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26646)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26646)\">Job 38:7<\/a><\/span>),\n<\/p><p>\nthat the plan of salvation had been made and that the Savior had been chosen. We, no doubt,\nwere happy together, all of the children of God. The Prophet Joseph tells us\nthat we were all present in the spirit, intelligent beings able to sit in council with the Gods.\nWe must have been living in love and helpfulness under those conditions, and the fact of our\nhaving come to earth should not change our thoughts and our feelings. We ought to love one\nanother just the same here as when we lived in love and happiness in our heavenly home.\n<\/p><p>\nMEANING OF LOVE REVEALED THROUGH DREAM\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has revealed to me, by dreams, something more than I ever understood or felt\nbefore about the love for God and the love for fellow men. I believe in dreams, brethren and\nsisters. The Lord has given me dreams, which to me, are just as real and as much from God\nas was the dream of King Nebuchadnezzar\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"10590\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10590)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10590)\">Dan. 2:1<\/a><\/span>)\nwhich was the means of saving a nation from\nstarvation (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23520\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23520)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23520)\">Gen. 41:1<\/a><\/span>),\nor the dream of Lehi who through a dream led his colony out of the old country,\nacross the mighty deep to this promised land\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1462\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1462)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1462)\">1 Ne. 2:1<\/a><\/span>),\nor any other dreams that we read of in scripture.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is not out of place for us to have important dream, for we read in the scriptures:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all\nflesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions,\nand your old men shall dream dreams\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7549\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7549)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7549)\">Acts 2:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMore than forty years ago I had a dream, which I am sure was from the Lord. In this dream I\nwas in the presence of my Savior as he stood in mid-air. He spoke no word to me, but my\nlove for him was such that I have not words to explain. I know that no mortal man can love\nthe Lord as I experienced that love for the Savior unless God reveals it unto him. I would\nhave remained in his presence, but there was a power drawing me away from him, and as a\nresult of that dream I had this feeling, that no matter what might be required at my hands,\nwhat the gospel might entail unto me, I would do what I should be asked to do, even to the\nlaying down of my life (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27255\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27255)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27255)\">John 15:13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so when we read in the scriptures what the Savior said to his disciples:\n<\/p><p>\nIn my Father's house are many mansions: . . . I go to prepare a place for you . . . that where\nI am, there ye may be also (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27244\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27244)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27244)\">John 14:2-3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI think that is where I want to be. If only I can be with my Savior and have that same sense\nof love that I had in that dream, it will be the goal of my existence, the desire of my life.\n<\/p><p>\nOBLIGATION TO LOVE OUR ENEMIES\n<\/p><p>\nThen a few years ago, at the closing of a conference of the St. Johns Stake, we had had a\nwonderful conference I thought, and I was very happy on retiring. I was sleeping in the home\nof the president of the stake, Brother Levi Udall, and that night I had a\nremarkable dream. I have seldom mentioned this to other people, but I do not know why I\nshould not. It seems to me appropriate in talking along this line. I dreamed that I and a group\nof my own associates found ourselves in a courtyard where, around the outer edge of it, were\nGerman soldiers&mdash;and Fuhrer Adolph Hitler was there with his group, and they seemed to be\nsharpening their swords and cleaning their guns, and making preparations for a slaughter of\nsome kind, or an execution. We knew not what, but, evidently we were the objects. But\npresently a circle was formed and this Fuhrer and his men were all within the circle, and my\ngroup and I were circled on the outside, and he was sitting on the inside of the circle with his\nback to the outside, and when we walked around and I got directly opposite to him, I stepped\ninside the circle and walked across to where he was sitting, and spoke to him in a manner\nsomething like this:\n<\/p><p>\n\"I am your brother. You are my brother. In our heavenly home we lived together in love and\npeace. Why can we not so live here on the earth?\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it seemed to me that I felt in myself, welling up in my soul, a love for that man, and I\ncould feel that he was having the same experience, and presently he arose, and we embraced\neach other and kissed each other, a kiss of affection.\n<\/p><p>\nThen the scene changed so that our group was within the circle, and he and his group were on\nthe outside, and when he came around to where I was standing, he stepped inside the circle\nand embraced me again, with a kiss of affection.\n<\/p><p>\nI think the Lord gave me that dream. Why should I dream of this man, one of the greatest\nenemies of mankind, and one of the wickedest, but that the Lord should teach me that I must\nlove my enemies (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34045\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34045)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34045)\">Matt. 5:44<\/a><\/span>),\nand I must love the wicked as well as the good?\n<\/p><p>\nNow, who is there in this wide world that I could not love under those conditions, if I could\nonly continue to feel as I felt then? I have tried to maintain this feeling and, thank the Lord, I\nhave no enmity toward any person in this world; I can forgive all men, so far as I am\nconcerned, and I am happy in doing so and in the love which I have for my fellow men.\n<\/p><p>\nI love the Saints of God, as I love the Lord and his work. I love you faithful men and women\nwho are laboring for the Lord, and for your fellow men.\n<\/p><p>\nFAITHFULNESS COMMENDED\n<\/p><p>\nI would like to endorse what Brother S. Dilworth Young said in complimenting the mission\npresidents of this Church. I feel as he feels in that regard. The picture was not overdrawn, and\nI think we could draw a similar picture of the presidents of the stakes in this Church, and of\nthe bishops of wards, and of many other faithful men and women.\n<\/p><p>\nI remember on one occasion going by train to Alberta, Canada. As we approached Raymond,\nthe wind was blowing, and there had been a light snowfall which was drifting, and I saw a\nwoman and two or three children out in the beet fields working among the beets, and I have\nnever forgotten the feeling I had. Those people working, almost their finger ends off, to make\na living, and because God has said that one tenth of their interest should be given annually\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12311\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12311)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12311)\">D&amp;C 119:4<\/a><\/span>) to\nhim for the building up his kingdom when they get their meager returns, as faithful Saints,\nthey will give to the Lord one tenth. And that is going on all through this Church.\n<\/p><p>\nAs we visit the stakes and learn that these stake officers and ward officers, almost universally,\nare full tithepayers and keep the Word of Wisdom, hundreds of thousands of them,\nmanifesting their love for God, their faithfulness in keeping his commandments, their\nwillingness to help carry on this great latter-day work, how can we do otherwise than love\nthem?\n<\/p><p>\nGod bless you, brethren and sisters, for your faithfulness, and reward you abundantly therefore\nin time and throughout eternity, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
