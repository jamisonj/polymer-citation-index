One of mother\u2019s grandsons said he had watched with wonderment as his tiny daughter paged through her storybook, moistening her first finger to turn the pages as she had seen her daddy do as he read his books. Actually, she was moistening the finger on her left hand and turning the pages with the finger on her right hand! But that only served to emphasize both the power of example and the fact that she, like all the rest of us, is yet learning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/he-means-me.p6\" class=\"\">As I observed two of our lovely grown daughters that night an incident from the past came to mind that forms the burden of my brief message today. I still think of it with a tendency to tears. Another little girl had joined our family and was of course much loved. Occasionally I had called her older sister \u201cPrincess,\u201d but had thought about that, and, since the second young lady was equally deserving of royal treatment, had concluded that it would be well for her to share the title, if it were used at all.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1979\/05\/he-means-me.p7\" class=\"\">So one day I called to her, \u201cCome on, Princess.
