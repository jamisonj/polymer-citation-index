I should like, if\nthe Lord will bless me, to give vent to some thoughts that have been deeply impressed upon\nmy mind for several weeks now. I hope I shall not be misunderstood. It seems to me that the\nday in which we live demands a frank and forthright consideration of some of the problems\nwhich face us not only as a Church but also as a great Christian nation.\n<\/p><p>\nWith you I thrilled at the opening address of our great leader, President McKay. As I have\nthought of his remarks regarding this land of America, its achievements, and its needs, I have\nfelt that I could characterize best what he said in two words: Spiritual Statesmanship. With\nyou I love this land in which we live. I am proud of our heritage; I am grateful for the\nAmerican tradition; I am thankful that the Lord has given through his prophets information\nregarding this great nation.\n<\/p><p>\nHowever, it seems to me that there are certain tendencies, trends, and practices which\nendanger very greatly our way of life and strike at the very foundation of much that we hold\ndear as a great Christian nation. Of course, the conditions of the world generally give us cause\nfor concern. We seem to live in a world of conflict, insecurity, uncertainty, and almost\nbewilderment. We appear to be groping blindly, aimlessly, unable to find the way. Were it not\nfor our faith in the prophecies of God I fear sometimes we would almost be tempted to give\nup.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are in the midst of continuing international crises. The outlook for world peace and\nsecurity is dark indeed. The gravity of the world situation, it appears, is increasing almost\ndaily. The United Nations seems unable to settle the troubles of the world. In truth we are\nfaced with the hard fact that the United Nations, it seems, has largely failed in its purpose.\nYes, the days ahead are sobering and challenging ones. We might well ask, America&mdash;what\nof the future?\n<\/p><p>\nI never travel across this great land and note its broad, fruitful farms, its humming factories\nand gleaming cities but what I am impressed with the marvels of this great nation. Yes, we\nhave made unequaled material progress. We have become the greatest and the richest nation\nin all the world. This has been done on about 6% of the land area of the world by a relatively\nsmall group of people, only 7% of the world's population. Yet it is reported that this small\ngroup of people produce today approximately half of the world's total wealth in usable form\nto satisfy human needs. It is reported that in the year 1950 almost half of the food and fiber\nof the world was produced here in the United States. Our productivity has increased one-fifth\nevery ten years since 1850. Through the use of machines much of the drudgery and toil so\ncommon in many other nations has disappeared. Our engineers have estimated that the\naverage worker today has the equivalent of 99 mechanical slaves working for him. The\nTwentieth Century Fund recently predicted that by 1960, 96% of all the energy going into\nphysical work in America would be performed by machines, 1% by horses, and 3% by men.\nThe average American worker has an output per hour six times his output in 1850. Yes, we\nhave made unprecedented achievements in material things.\n<\/p><p>\nThe prophets of God foreshadowed these achievements when they predicted that this would be\na land choice above all other lands\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1504\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1504)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1504)\">1 Ne. 2:20<\/a><\/span>)\nand that it would be preserved for a righteous people\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22188\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22188)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22188)\">Ether 2:7<\/a><\/span>).\nThose who were to dwell here, if they served the God of the land, should be free from\nbondage and captivity (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22190\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22190)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22190)\">Ether 2:12<\/a><\/span>).\nLehi, who led the second colony which came to this great land, was\ntold that he was leading that colony to a land of promise and that none should come here save\nthose who would come here under the influence of heaven\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3534\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3534)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3534)\">2 Ne. 1:6<\/a><\/span>). This land would be consecrated\nunto those whom the Lord would guide here. It would be a land of liberty. Lehi's son, Jacob,\nsaid there should be no kings upon this land, that the God of heaven would be their king that\nthis land would be fortified against all other nations, and that he who would fight against Zion\nshould perish (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3539\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3539)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3539)\">2 Ne. 10:11-14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nReference has been made by President Young to the coming of Columbus. The scriptures tell\nus that the Spirit wrought upon Columbus\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1508\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1508)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1508)\">1 Ne. 13:12<\/a><\/span>),\nand upon those who followed him, and that they\ncame here under the inspiration of heaven. Nephi predicted that when they arrived, they\nwould humble themselves before God, that the power of the Lord would be with them, and\nthat they would prosper. Our history clearly records that the early peoples who did come were\nhumble, God-fearing men and women. Bradford records that their first act upon arriving here\nupon American soil was to go upon their knees in humble prayer and bless the God of\nheaven.\n<\/p><p>\nThe impelling force in their hearts it seems to me, was a love for basic ideals and principles,\nwhich were dearer to them than life itself. Among these were their love of God, faith in his\ndivine purposes, their love of freedom industry, thrift, decency, and honor. Yes, this nation\nhad its beginning in a high-minded manner. The rules of conduct established by the early\ncolonists and our founding fathers were taken from the scriptures. They were embodied in the\nDecalogue and in the gospel. The Sabbath was set aside as a sacred day\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22625\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22625)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22625)\">Ex. 20:8<\/a><\/span>). Profanity and other\nvices were condemned, and gambling was forbidden. People were encouraged to keep good\ncompany and to repeat no grievances. They emphasized the spiritual virtues.\n<\/p><p>\nWashington but echoed the general feeling of the early colonists when he acknowledged\nGod's direction and emphasized the importance of spirituality honor, and moral courage. He\nsaid: \n<\/p><p>\nNo people can be found to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts\nthe affairs of men more than the people of the United States. Every step by which they\nhave advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been\ndistinguished by some token of providential agency.\n<\/p><p>\nThen as to the place of religion and morality, the Father of our country stated: \n<\/p><p>\nOf all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and\nmorality are indispensable supports . . . Reason and experience both forbid us to\nexpect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.\n<\/p><p>\nHis successors spoke in similar vein. Lincoln emphasized the same thought when he\nacknowledged that \"God rules this world,\" and that \"It is the duty of nations as well as men to\nown their dependence upon the overruling power of God, to confess their sins and\ntransgressions in humble sorrow...,\" and then quoting from the scriptures, \"and to recognize\nthe sublime truth that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord.\" Yes, my\nbrethren and sisters, they spoke of self-evident truths&mdash;inalienable rights.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Prophet Joseph came upon the scene to open a new gospel dispensation, he shed\neven further light upon the establishment of this great nation and the coming forth of the\nConstitution, which he stated was a glorious standard, founded in the wisdom of God.\nThrough revelation the Lord said to him, as was quoted by Brother Moyle yesterday,\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of\nwise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the\nshedding of blood (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13032\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13032)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13032)\">D&amp;C 101:79-80<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe have enjoyed divine favor through much of our history, but what of the future? It seems\nto me, my brethren and sisters, that the lessons of history, many of them very sobering, ought\nto be turned to during this hour of our great achievement because I feel in my own heart that\nduring the hour of our success is our greatest danger. I feel firmly that even during the hour\nof great prosperity, a nation may sow the seeds of its own destruction. This may happen even\nduring a period of great income, relatively full employment, and high business activity.\nHistory reveals that rarely is a great civilization conquered from without until it has weakened\nor destroyed itself within.\n<\/p><p>\nI read recently volume three of that monumental work by Will Durant, The Story of\nCivilization. This volume entitled Caesar and Christ, covers the rise and fall of the Roman\nEmpire and the coming forth of Christianity. It covers a period of 1125 years, from 800 B.C.\nto 325 A.D. At the end of this six-hundred-page volume, the author writes an epilogue under\nthe caption \"Why Rome Fell.\" It is generally agreed that not infrequently history repeats itself.\nThe author lists the major causes why this great civilization fell apart. I wonder if there is\nanything in what he says for us to take note of today. As a read this volume I was caused to\nreflect on the similarity of conditions and practices then and now. May I give you briefly his\nsummary: \n<\/p><p>\nThe first group of causes he termed biological, and no doubt most fundamental. They had to\ndo with the limitation of families, the deferment and avoidance of marriage, the refusal of\nmen and women to shoulder the great responsibilities, God-ordained, of honorable parenthood.\nHe mentioned that sexual excesses were indulged in commonly, both in and outside the\nmarriage covenant. The operation of contraception and abortion was common. This, together\nwith other things, resulted in reduced fertility. Sex ran riot, and moral decay resulted.\n<\/p><p>\nHe mentioned as another cause of Rome's decay, the waste of natural resources in mining,\ndeforestation, erosion, the neglect of irrigation canals but most important of all, the negligence\nof harassed and discouraged men the failure to teach high moral principles so necessary for\nthe building of real character.\n<\/p><p>\nThen he lists with great emphasis the rising costs of government because of armies, doles,\npublic works, expanding bureaucracy, a parasitic court, depreciation of currency, absorption of\ninvestment capital by confiscatory taxation.\n<\/p><p>\nIs there anything suggestive in this summary?\n<\/p><p>\nMay I give you the following figures on this last grouping particularly, taken from what seem\nto be reliable sources? According to projected estimates, our federal government will spend\nduring the coming fiscal years, 1952-53, more than the total income of all the people west of\nthe Mississippi River&mdash;22 states. The federal payroll in 1952 will top 22 billion&mdash;4 billion\nabove last year and 16 times the 1929 total. Nearly one out of every four adult Americans is\nreceiving regularly federal checks. At the present rate, by 1953 the government will be\nspending approximately 38% of the national income. During only three of the last twenty\nyears has our federal budget been balanced. It requires today approximately 2 1\/2 million\ncivilians to staff the federal bureaucracy.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the matter of the depreciation of the currency, it is reported that the present dollar is worth\nonly 38 cents compared to the 1913 dollar, and that the dollar today will purchase only about\nhalf as much as it did in 1935-39.\n<\/p><p>\nAs to taxation, the federal government took in taxes during all past administrations up to six\nyears ago&mdash;156 years&mdash;248 billion dollars. In the last six years we have taken in taxes 260\nbillion, and still we seem not to have enough to pay our current bills. With a debt of over\none-quarter of a trillion dollars the annual interest payment is 6 billion dollars plus, more than\nall government expenditures in 1933.\n<\/p><p>\nNow, my brethren and sisters this author lists other causes. Political causes, he says, were\nrooted in one fact that through centralized control and the increasing despotism of the state,\nthe citizens' civic sense was destroyed and dried up, thus destroying statesmanship at its\nsource. Men felt powerless to express themselves and lost interest in government. Yet, I\npresume, Rome has had no equal in the art of government. She achieved a democracy of free\nmen and then destroyed it with corruption and violence.\n<\/p><p>\nWith you, I love this great land in which we live. I pray for the chief executive and his\ncabinet and the legislative and judicial branches, the officials of our states and our cities. But\nI wonder sometimes, my brethren and sisters, what our founding fathers, our pioneer fathers,\nwould do and say if they were here today. I'm sure they would give serious reflection to\npresent conditions. I wonder if they would not recognize that our liberties have already been\nabridged, that there has been too much of a tendency for us to call upon our federal\ngovernment every time we felt the need for the accomplishment of any particular objective. I\nwonder if we haven't had a tendency to call for help for those things which our forefathers\nwould have done willingly for themselves. Yes, I presume as a people we are to blame, but I\nfeel that if they were here today, they would apply some very definite tests before any new\nservice or new program were approved. May I just mention three: \n<\/p><p>\n<i>First<\/i>, I think they would ask the question: Can this service, assuming it is needed, be done\nmore efficiently, more effectively by our federal government or should we do it ourselves on\nthe local level? They believed that government is best which governs least. Government seems\nto be inherently wasteful and inefficient. Possibly it is because the profit motive and\ncompetition&mdash;the very life of private enterprise&mdash;are largely absent.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Second<\/i>, How will it affect the morale and the character of the people? This seems to me to be\nof great importance. They were interested in the building of character. They recognized that\ncharacter, not wealth or power or position, is of prime consideration.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Third<\/i>, they would possibly ask: How will it affect our free institutions&mdash;the church, the\nschool, the home, and our local form of government?\n<\/p><p>\nI believe if they were here, they would look for the answers to the decline of public morals.\nAs they looked searchingly for the answers, they would probably observe evidence of weak\nand vacillating leadership in many places, not confined to one group or one party. They\nwould find a tendency for men in high places to place political expediency ahead of principle.\nThey would be concerned with the alarming growth of a something-for-nothing philosophy, a\nfailure of people to stand on their own feet. They would probably find bad examples by\nunscrupulous politicians and by delinquent parents, and possibly a weakening of religious\ntraining, and the substitution therefore of a faith-destroying materialism.\n<\/p><p>\nI think, my brethren and sisters, as Latter-day Saints, and as American citizens, we need to\nrouse ourselves to the problems that confront us as a great Christian nation. We need to\nrecognize that these fundamental, basic principles, moral and spiritual, lay at the very\nfoundation of our achievements in the past. If we are to continue to enjoy our present\nblessings, we must have a return to these basic and fundamental principles. Economics and\nmorals are both parts of one inseparable body of truth, and they must be in harmony. We\nneed to square our actions and our policies with these eternal principles.\n<\/p><p>\nI wonder if we have forgotten the counsel of the prophets, the founding fathers, and our great\nstatesmen. Surely we need a nationwide return to these fundamentals. We need a nationwide\nrepentance to rid this land of corruption. We must return to the fundamental virtues that have\nmade this nation great. There is a force in the universe which no mortal can alter. This nation\ndoes have a spiritual foundation. It has been established in keeping with great spiritual and\nmoral principles, but there seems to be a tendency for us to lose our sense of uprightness and\nto do wilfully those things which we must know to be wrong. This cannot be done with\nimpunity.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to raise our sights beyond the dollar sign, beyond material things. May we have\nthe courage to stand up and be counted, to stand for principle, for those principles and ideals\nwhich guided the founding fathers in the establishment of this great land. Thank God for the\npromises that have been made regarding the future of America. I hope and pray we shall\nrealize the fulfillment of these promises because we merit their fulfillment. I am grateful that\nthe Lord has said through his prophets that this nation unto the righteous shall be blessed\nforever (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3535\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3535)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3535)\">2 Ne. 1:7<\/a><\/span>),\nand that he will be a light unto them forever that hear his words\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3540\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3540)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3540)\">2 Ne. 10:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us that we may not drift farther from the principles of faith and honor established\nby those noble founding fathers and the pioneers who settled these valleys. We need this faith,\nwe need a close adherence to these basic principles. It is my conviction my brethren and\nsisters, that this nation or no other nation will be saved materially unless in some way it is\nstrengthened, redeemed, and regenerated spiritually. God bless us in that redemption, that we\nmay go forward and live the principles that have been so basic and so fundamental in\nbringing this great nation to its present standing in the world, I humbly pray in the name of\nJesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
