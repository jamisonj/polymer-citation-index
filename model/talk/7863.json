The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands apart from other churches that claim their authority is derived from historical succession, the scriptures, or theological training.

Kimball, \u201cThe Example of Abraham,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> June 1975, 3). Priesthood is the means whereby the Lord acts through men to save souls. One of the defining features of the Church of Jesus Christ, both anciently and today, is His authority. There can be no true Church without divine authority.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p11\" class=\"\">Ordinary men are given the authority of the priesthood.

Nothing about the priesthood is self-centered. The priesthood always is used to serve, to bless, and to strengthen other people.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p14\" class=\"\">The higher priesthood is received by a solemn covenant that includes the obligation to act in the authority (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122915\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122915)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122915)\">D&amp;C 68:8<\/a><\/span>) and the office (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122916\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122916)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122916)\">D&amp;C 107:99<\/a><\/span>) that have been received.

Accordingly, <span class=\"emphasis\">to break this covenant one needs only to do nothing<\/span>\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The Miracle of Forgiveness<\/span> [1969], 96).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p19\" class=\"\">As we do our best to fulfill our priesthood responsibilities, we can be blessed with priesthood power. The power of the priesthood is God\u2019s power operating through men and boys like us and requires personal righteousness, faithfulness, obedience, and diligence. A boy or a man may receive priesthood authority by the laying on of hands but will have no priesthood power if he is disobedient, unworthy, or unwilling to serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cThe rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and \u2026 the <span class=\"emphasis\">powers<\/span> of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cThat they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122919\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122919)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122919)\">D&amp;C 121:36\u201337<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p22\" class=\"\">Brethren, for a boy or a man to receive priesthood authority but neglect to do what is necessary to qualify for priesthood power is unacceptable to the Lord.

My mom was a descendant of pioneers who sacrificed everything for the Church and kingdom of God. My dad was not a member of our Church and, as a young man, had desired to become a Catholic priest. Ultimately, he elected not to attend theological seminary and instead pursued a career as a tool and die maker.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p25\" class=\"\">For much of his married life, my father attended meetings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with our family. In fact, many of the people in our ward had no idea that my dad was not a member of the Church. He played on and coached our ward softball team, helped with Scout activities, and supported my mother in her various callings and responsibilities. I want to tell you about one of the great lessons I learned from my father about priesthood authority and power.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p26\" class=\"\">As a boy I asked my dad many times each week when he was going to be baptized. He responded lovingly but firmly each time I pestered him: \u201cDavid, I am not going to join the Church for your mother, for you, or for anyone else. I will join the Church when I know it is the right thing to do.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p27\" class=\"\">I believe I was in my early teenage years when the following conversation occurred with my father. We had just returned home from attending our Sunday meetings together, and I asked my dad when he was going to be baptized. He smiled and said, \u201cYou are the one always asking me about being baptized. Today I have a question for you.\u201d I quickly and excitedly concluded that now we were making progress!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p28\" class=\"\">My dad continued, \u201cDavid, your church teaches that the priesthood was taken from the earth anciently and has been restored by heavenly messengers to the Prophet Joseph Smith, right?\u201d I replied that his statement was correct. Then he said, \u201cHere is my question. Each week in priesthood meeting I listen to the bishop and the other priesthood leaders remind, beg, and plead with the men to do their home teaching and to perform their priesthood duties. If your church truly has the restored priesthood of God, why are so many of the men in your church no different about doing their religious duty than the men in my church?\u201d My young mind immediately went completely blank. I had no adequate answer for my dad.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p29\" class=\"\">I believe my father was wrong to judge the validity of our Church\u2019s claim to divine authority by the shortcomings of the men with whom he associated in our ward. But embedded in his question to me was a correct assumption that men who bear God\u2019s holy priesthood should be different from other men. Men who hold the priesthood are not inherently better than other men, but they should act differently. Men who hold the priesthood should not only receive priesthood authority but also become worthy and faithful conduits of God\u2019s power. \u201cBe ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122920\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122920)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122920)\">D&amp;C 38:42<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p30\" class=\"\">I have never forgotten the lessons about priesthood authority and power I learned from my father, a good man not of our faith, who expected more from men who claimed to bear God\u2019s priesthood. That Sunday afternoon conversation with my dad many years ago produced in me a desire to be a \u201cgood boy.\u201d I did not want to be a poor example and a stumbling block to my father\u2019s progress in learning about the restored gospel. I simply wanted to be a good boy. The Lord needs all of us as bearers of His authority to be honorable, virtuous, and good boys at all times and in all places.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p31\" class=\"\">You may be interested to know that a number of years later, my father was baptized. And at the appropriate times, I had the opportunity to confer upon him the Aaronic and the Melchizedek Priesthoods. One of the great experiences of my life was observing my dad receive the authority and, ultimately, the power of the priesthood.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p32\" class=\"\">I share with you this pointed lesson I learned from my father to emphasize a simple truth. Receiving the authority of the priesthood by the laying on of hands is an important beginning, but it is not enough. Ordination confers authority, but righteousness is required to act with power as we strive to lift souls, to teach and testify, to bless and counsel, and to advance the work of salvation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p33\" class=\"\">In this momentous season of the earth\u2019s history, you and I as bearers of the priesthood need to be righteous men and effective instruments in the hands of God. We need to rise up as men of God. You and I would do well to learn from and heed the example of Nephi, the grandson of Helaman and the first of the twelve disciples called by the Savior at the beginning of His ministry among the Nephites. \u201cAnd [Nephi] did minister many things unto them. \u2026 And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"122921\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122921)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122921)\">3\u00a0Nephi 7:17<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\u201cPlease Help My Husband Understand\u201d<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p35\" class=\"\">At the conclusion of the temple recommend interviews I conducted as a bishop and stake president, I often would ask the married sisters how I could best serve them and their families. The consistency of the answers I received from those faithful women was both instructive and alarming. The sisters rarely complained or criticized, but they often responded as follows: \u201cPlease help my husband understand his responsibility as a priesthood leader in our home. I am happy to take the lead in scripture study, family prayer, and family home evening, and I will continue to do so. But I wish my husband would be an equal partner and provide the strong priesthood leadership only he can give. Please help my husband learn how to become a patriarch and a priesthood leader in our home who presides and protects.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p36\" class=\"\">I reflect often on the sincerity of those sisters and their request. Priesthood leaders hear similar concerns today. Many wives are pleading for husbands who have not only priesthood authority but also priesthood power. They yearn to be equally yoked with a faithful husband and priesthood companion in the work of creating a Christ-centered and gospel-focused home.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/the-powers-of-heaven.p37\" class=\"\">Brethren, I promise that if you and I will prayerfully ponder the pleas of these sisters, the Holy Ghost will help us to see ourselves as we really are (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"122922\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 122922)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(122922)\">D&amp;C 93:24<\/a><\/span>) and help us recognize the things we need to change and improve.
