It was on that April morning that I heard my name read as one presented for your sustaining vote as a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles. It became my obligation to stand with those other living men who have been called as special witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ upon the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p5\" class=\"\">You must have wondered, as I did, why this call should come to me. It seemed accidental at times, that I was preserved in worthiness, yet there was always the constant, quiet, lingering feeling about being guided and being prepared.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p6\" class=\"\">It has been our privilege this morning to raise our hands to sustain the President of the Church. I count that a great privilege and special obligation, for I have a witness about him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p7\" class=\"\">Some weeks before the meeting of last April, I left the office one Friday afternoon thinking of the weekend conference assignment. I waited for the elevator to come down from the fifth floor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p8\" class=\"\">As the elevator doors quietly opened, there stood President Joseph Fielding Smith. There was a moment of surprise in seeing him, since his office is on a lower floor.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p9\" class=\"\">As I saw him framed in the doorway, there fell upon me a powerful witness\u2014there stands the prophet of God. That sweet voice of Spirit that is akin to light, that has something to do with pure intelligence, affirmed to me that this was the prophet of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p10\" class=\"\">I need not try to define that experience to Latter-day Saints. That kind of witness is characteristic of this church. It is not something reserved to those in high office. It is a witness, not only available but vital, to every member.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p11\" class=\"\">As it is with the President, so it is with his counselors.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p12\" class=\"\">North of us in the Wasatch Range stand three mountain peaks. The poet would describe them as mighty pyramids of stone. The center one, the highest of the three, the map would tell you is Willard Peak. But the pioneers called them \u201cThe Presidency.\u201d If you should go to Willard, look to the east, and up, way up, there stands \u201cThe Presidency.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p13\" class=\"\">Thank God for the presidency. Like those peaks, they stand with nothing above them but the heavens. They need our sustaining vote. It is sometimes lonely in those lofty callings of leadership\u2014for their calling is not to please man, but to please the Lord. God bless these three great and good men.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p14\" class=\"\">Occasionally during the past year I have been asked a question. Usually it comes as a curious, almost an idle, question about the qualifications to stand as a witness for Christ. The question they ask is, \u201cHave you seen Him?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p15\" class=\"\">That is a question that I have never asked of another. I have not asked that question of my brethren in the Quorum, thinking that it would be so sacred and so personal that one would have to have some special inspiration, indeed, some authorization, even to ask it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p16\" class=\"\">There are some things just too sacred to discuss. We know that as it relates to the temples. In our temples, sacred ordinances are performed; sacred experiences are enjoyed.

The romantics and poets and couples in love, from the beginning of time, have sought more impressive ways of saying it, or singing it, or writing it. They have used all of the adjectives, all of the superlatives, all manner of poetic expression. And when all is said and done, the declaration which is most powerful is the simple, three-word variety.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p26\" class=\"\">To one who is honestly seeking, the testimony borne in these simple phrases is enough, for it is the spirit that beareth record, not the words.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/the-spirit-beareth-record.p27\" class=\"\">There is a power of communication as real and tangible as electricity.
