Mine was the responsibility to speak, to lift, to motivate, to inspire. There came to my mind the realization that here were men and women of promise. They represented the hopes, the dreams, and the aspirations of parents, of family, of teachers, of God. All were participants in the passing parade of mortality. Some were gifted in the arts, others leaned toward the humanities, while some found their talents prompted a study of the natural or physical sciences. These students stood on the stage of study. Soon they would disperse to make their marks in life, to fulfill the measure of their creation, and to learn from their own lives those lessons which would prepare them for the exaltation they seek.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-will-within.p4\" class=\"\">My thoughts turned to others striving to become master craftsmen through apprenticeship and experience. Then I reflected on that vast throng who had abandoned preparation, formed undesirable friendships, and adopted habits and practices which diverted them from that pathway which leads to perfection and enticed them along one of the many detours where sorrow, discouragement, and destruction await.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-will-within.p5\" class=\"\">The wayward son, the willful daughter, the pouting husband, the nagging wife\u2014all can change.

On numerous occasions, there would be a soft knock on the back door. When I opened the door, there I would see a man, sometimes two, ill-clothed, ill-fed, ill-schooled. Generally, such a visitor held in his hand the familiar cap. His hair would be tousled, his face unshaven. The question was always the same: \u201cCould you spare some food?\u201d My dear mother invariably responded with a pleasant, \u201cCome in and sit down at the table.\u201d She would then prepare a ham sandwich, cut a piece of cake, and pour a glass of milk. Mother would ask the visitor about his home, his family, his life. She provided hope and words of encouragement. Before leaving, the visitor would pause to express a gracious thank-you. I would note that a smile of content had replaced a look of despair. Eyes that were dull now shone with new purpose. Love, that noblest attribute of the human soul, can work wonders.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-will-within.p19\" class=\"\">In our journey on earth, we discover that life is made up of challenges\u2014they just differ from one person to another. We are success oriented, striving to become \u201cwonder women\u201d and \u201csuper men.\u201d Any intimation of failure can cause panic, even despair. Who among us cannot remember moments of failure?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-will-within.p20\" class=\"\">One such moment came to me as a young basketball player. The game was close\u2014hotly contested\u2014when the coach called me from the bench to run a key play. For some reason which I shall never understand, I took the pass and dribbled the ball right through the opposing team. I jumped high toward the basket; and, as the basketball left my fingertips, I came to the abrupt realization that I was shooting for the wrong basket. I offered the shortest prayer I have ever spoken: \u201cDear Father, don\u2019t let that ball go in.\u201d My prayer was answered, but my ordeal was just beginning. I heard a loud cheer erupt from the adoring fans: \u201cWe want Monson, we want Monson, we want Monson \u2026 OUT!\u201d The coach obliged.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-will-within.p21\" class=\"\">Not long ago I read about an incident that occurred in the life of President Harry S. Truman after he had retired and was back in Independence, Missouri. He was at Truman Library, talking with some elementary school students and answering their questions. Finally, a question came from an owlish little boy. \u201cMr. President,\u201d he said, \u201cwas you popular when you was a boy?\u201d The President looked at the boy and answered, \u201cWhy, no. I was never popular. The popular boys were the ones who were good at games and had big, tight fists. I was never like that. Without my glasses, I was blind as a bat, and to tell the truth, I was kind of a sissy.\u201d The little boy started to applaud, and then everyone else did, too.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Vital Speeches,<\/span> Feb. 1983, p. 6.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-will-within.p22\" class=\"\">Our responsibility is to rise from mediocrity to competence, from failure to achievement. Our task is to become our best selves. One of God\u2019s greatest gifts to us is the joy of trying again, for no failure ever need be final. In 1902, the poetry editor of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Atlantic Monthly<\/span> returned a sheaf of poems to a 28-year-old poet with this curt note: \u201cOur magazine has no room for your vigorous verse.\u201d The poet was Robert Frost. In 1894, the rhetoric teacher at Harrow in England wrote on a 16-year-old\u2019s report card, \u201cA conspicuous lack of success.\u201d The 16-year-old was Winston Churchill.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-will-within.p23\" class=\"\">President Theodore Roosevelt said, \u201cIt is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.

No more vivid example is recorded than the life of Saul of Tarsus. The sacred record reveals that Saul threatened the disciples of the Lord.

In December of 1985 the First Presidency proclaimed \u201cAn Invitation to Come Back.\u201d To the inactive, the critical, the transgressor, the message declared: \u201c\u2018Come back. Come back and feast at the table of the Lord, and taste again the sweet and satisfying fruits of fellowship with the Saints\u2019\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign, <\/span>Mar. 1986, p. 88). Hundreds, if not thousands, have responded to this invitation. Their lives have taken on new meaning. Their families have been blessed. They have drawn closer to God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-will-within.p31\" class=\"\">In the private sanctuary of one\u2019s own conscience lies that spirit, that determination to cast off the old person and to measure up to the stature of true potential. But the way is rugged, and the course is strenuous. So discovered John Helander from Goteborg, Sweden. John is twenty-six years of age and is handicapped, in that it is difficult for him to coordinate his motions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-will-within.p32\" class=\"\">At a youth conference in Kungsbacka, Sweden, John took part in a 1500-meter running race. He had no chance to win. Rather, his was the opportunity to be humiliated, mocked, derided, scorned. Perhaps John remembered another who lived long ago and far away. Wasn\u2019t He mocked? Wasn\u2019t He derided? Wasn\u2019t He scorned? But He prevailed. He won His race. Maybe John could win his.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-will-within.p33\" class=\"\">What a race it was! Struggling, surging, pressing, the runners bolted far beyond John. There was wonderment among the spectators. Who is this runner who lags so far behind? The participants on their second lap of this two-lap race passed John while he was but halfway through the first lap. Tension mounted as the runners pressed toward the tape. Who would win? Who would place second? Then came the final burst of speed; the tape was broken. The crowd cheered; the winner was proclaimed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-will-within.p34\" class=\"\">The race was over\u2014or was it? Who is this contestant who continues to run when the race is ended? He crosses the finish line on but his first lap. Doesn\u2019t the foolish lad know he has lost? Ever onward he struggles, the only participant now on the track. This is his race. This must be his victory. No one among the vast throng of spectators leaves. Every eye is on this valiant runner. He makes the final turn and moves toward the finish line. There is awe; there is admiration. Every spectator sees himself running his own race of life. As John approaches the finish line, the audience, as one, rises to its feet. There is a loud applause of acclaim. Stumbling, falling, exhausted but victorious, John Helander breaks the newly tightened tape. (Officials are human beings, too.) The cheering echoes for miles. And just maybe, if the ear is carefully attuned, that Great Scorekeeper\u2014even the Lord\u2014can be heard to say, \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"37168\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 37168)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(37168)\">Matt. 25:21<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1987\/05\/the-will-within.p35\" class=\"\">Each of us is a runner in the race of life.
