It was a timeworn copy of the Book of Mormon. Almost every page was marked; in spite of tender handling, some of the leaves were dog-eared, and the cover was worn thin. No one had to tell her that one can get closer to God by reading the Book of Mormon than by any other book. She was already there. She had read it, studied it, prayed over it, and taught from it. As a young man I held her book in my hands and tried to see, through her eyes, the great truths of the Book of Mormon to which she so readily testified and which she so greatly loved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p4\" class=\"\">As a young boy in the Cottonwood Ward, I was greatly impressed when I listened to James H.

They, along with Oliver Cowdery, had testified in connection with the original publication of the Book of Mormon \u201cthat an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we \u2026 bear record that these things are true.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43154\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43154)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43154)\">\u201cThe Testimony of Three Witnesses,\u201d Book of Mormon<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/11\/the-keystone-of-our-religion.p5\" class=\"\">When James H.

He told me in all the solemnity of his advanced years, that the testimony he had given to the world, and which was published in the Book of Mormon, was true, every word of it, and that he had never deviated nor departed in any particular from that testimony, and that nothing in the world could separate him from the sacred message that was delivered to him. I still wondered if it was not possible that he could have been deceived, \u2026 so I induced him to relate to me, under such cross-examination as I was able to interpose, every detail of what took place. He described minutely the spot in the woods, the large log that separated him from the angel, and that he saw the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated, that he handled them, and that he did hear the voice of God declare that the plates were correctly translated. I asked him if there was any possibility for him to have been deceived, and that it was all a mistake, but he said, \u2018No.\u2019\u201d (quoted in Gordon B.
