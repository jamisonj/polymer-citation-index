Hatch and myself, as we waited down at Las Vegas, Nevada, a few\nweeks ago for a late, delayed train. We chanced to be in conversation with a life insurance\nsalesman who is reputed to be one of the outstanding salesmen in America. He expressed a\nsentiment that has intrigued me, and I want to repeat it to you because of the impression it\nmade upon me. He said, \"If you ever want to stir a man into action, you want to back up the\nhearse and let him smell the flowers prepared for his own service.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAt first that seemed to be\na terribly gruesome prospect, but as I thought about it the more, it seemed to me that after all\nit was but a crude way of stating a great eternal truth that has been thundered to us by the\nprophets from the beginning. All through the scriptures we have had a counsel given us that\nall that we should do, we should do with an eye single to the glory of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12862\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12862)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12862)\">D&amp;C 4:5<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12913\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12913)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12913)\">D&amp;C 88:67<\/a><\/span>),\nwhich glory the\nLord declared to Moses, was to bring to pass immortality and eternal life\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38988\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38988)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38988)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>), that very reminder\nthat death draws nearer each day that we live. It was that same thought expressed by the\nApostle Paul when he said: \n<\/p><p>\nIf in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.\n<\/p><p>\n. . . For as In Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"208\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 208)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(208)\">1 Cor. 15:19,22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTHE TIME TO PREPARE\n<\/p><p>\nIt was also the great prophet Amulek's testimony in which he declared,\n<\/p><p>\nFor behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God . . . [and] to perform\ntheir labors.\n<\/p><p>\n  . . . for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity behold, if we\ndo not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein\nthere can be no labor performed.\n<\/p><p>\nFor behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death,\nbehold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil and he doth seal you his;\ntherefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you,\nand the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8909\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8909)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8909)\">Alma 34:32-33,35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt was this very reminder that the Angel Moroni gave to the Prophet Joseph, which he records\nin that famous Wentworth letter when he quoted the Angel Moroni as saying that\n<\/p><p>\n. . . preparatory work for the second coming of the Messiah was speedily to\ncommence; that the time was at hand for the gospel in all its fullness to be preached in\npower, unto all nations, that a people might be prepared for the Millennial reign\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30309\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30309)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30309)\">JS&mdash;H 1:30-42<\/a><\/span>;\n<i>DHC<\/i> 4:537).\n<\/p><p>\nGOSPEL TO BE PREACHED\n<\/p><p>\nIn making for that preparation, the Lord has defined certain great responsibilities for his\nChurch. He said as one of the signs of his coming that the gospel of the kingdom was to be\npreached unto all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then should the end come, or\nthe destruction of the wicked (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34471\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34471)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34471)\">Matt. 24:14<\/a><\/span>).\nThat witness we have understood, was to be\na witness of the mission of the Messiah. It was to be a witness of the divinity of his mission.\nIt was to be a witness that the gospel of Jesus Christ had been restored in all its fullness, in\nthis the Dispensation of the fullness of Times.\n<\/p><p>\nA LIGHT TO THE WORLD\n<\/p><p>\nBut there was something else that we were supposed to witness which is also spoken of in the\nrevelations. Alma spoke of this to his people who were about to be baptized. As a part of the\ncovenant which they were about to enter, he said that they were to stand as witnesses of God\nat all times and in all things, and in all places that they might be in, even until death\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"40240\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40240)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40240)\">Mosiah 18:9<\/a><\/span>).\nIn one of the earliest revelations given in this dispensation, the Lord said,\n<\/p><p>\nAnd even so I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world, to be a light to the\nworld, and to be a standard for my people, and for the Gentiles to seek to it\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12887\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12887)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12887)\">D&amp;C 45:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHe again admonished us, on the day when he gave the name by which the Church was to be\ncalled. After giving us the name,\n<\/p><p>\n. . . thus shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus Christ\nof Latter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nVerily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that they light may be a standard for\nthe nations (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12938\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12938)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12938)\">D&amp;C 115:4-5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAs I have thought of those scriptures, I have remembered a statement that was made by an\nofficial of the United States Steel Corporation after I had spent an hour or two with him and\nhis company of officials down at Welfare Square. He said to me,  \"This is a practical\ndemonstration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, in giving aid to the needy and the less fortunate.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWITNESSES BEFORE THE WORLD\n<\/p><p>\nThat was a new concept to me, that in the welfare program we were standing as witnesses\nbefore the world of the divine way by which the Lord's work was to be done.\n<\/p><p>\nSo, we witness in our missionary work the magnificent spectacle of young men and young\nwomen, for the most part, to all the ends of the earth, that by their unselfish services they\nstand as witnesses at all times and in all places of the divine responsibility upon the Church to\nteach the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nSo, in making sacrifice, in the payment of our tithes, and in fasting and paying our fast\nofferings, in raising money to pay for meetinghouses and temples, again we are witnessing\nthat the law of sacrifice is required of all true Saints if we would claim kinship to him who\ngave his life that men might be.\n<\/p><p>\nIn our social conduct, in our dancing, in our play, we must never forget that in that play we\nare witnessing also that we are his special witnesses of the divinity of the organizations who\nsponsor our play.\n<\/p><p>\nSo, every boy in military service, and every girl in her social conduct, every businessman in\nhis dealings with his neighbor, is a witness as to whether or not this work in which he\nbelieves is divine. The Church rises or falls on the tide of these personal witnesses.\n<\/p><p>\nA few weeks ago I sat in fast meeting in the South Eighteenth Ward (Salt Lake City) and\nheard a lovely girl in her mid-twenties stand to bear her testimony. It was a thrilling\ntestimony of a beautiful Latter-day Saint girl. She told in her testimony about a morning out\non the farm in a little country district where at four o'clock in the morning she went out with\nher father to milk the cows. And as the father and she went out towards the barn, her father\ntook her by the hand and said, \"My girl, you are the product of this Church of Jesus Christ,\nand you are also the product of a true Latter-day Saint home. If you fail, so far as you are\nconcerned the Church has failed and your home has failed.\" That girl from that time has\nrealized that she, as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ, was a witness of it to all the\nworld either for good or for bad.\n<\/p><p>\nOh, the majesty of Joseph sold into Egypt, who shamed the beautiful but apparently unloved\nwife of Potiphar, when she would have tempted him to a serious sin, and he said, \"My master\ntrusts me, and thou art his wife. How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?\"\n(see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"23577\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23577)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23577)\">Gen. 39:8<\/a><\/span>).\nHe, too, felt his great responsibility in being a true witness of the divine\ntruths which he professed to believe.\n<\/p><p>\nIn one of the revelations the Lord said something else that to me has significance here. He\nsaid,\n<\/p><p>\nFor Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her\nstakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her\nbeautiful garments (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12907\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12907)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12907)\">D&amp;C 82:14<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJAPANESE MISSIONARY GIRL\n<\/p><p>\nI heard a lovely Japanese missionary girl down at Kamuela on the island of Hawaii a few\nyears ago make what I think was a personal application of that principle as it pertained to her\nhome. There were few missionaries in that day, the war was not yet ended, and this young\nlady and her companion were two of the only four missionaries on that island. We had in the\naudience eighty-five United States marines, all Latter-day Saints, who were being trained\nthere supposedly for an invasion of Japan, the homeland of these two lovely missionary girls.\nOur sister missionary was called to speak before that kind of audience. Tremblingly she stood\nat the pulpit, and this is what she said: \"When my father came to me and told me that they\nwanted me to go on a mission, I said to him, 'No, Father, I can't go on a mission.'\" He\npressed her as to why, and she said, \"Oh, I just can't.\" But he urged further, and then she\nsaid, \"I can't go because if I go out into the mission field I'll be expected to preach certain\nprinciples of the gospel, principles which my own father and my own family are not living.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe father asked, \"What are we not doing that you'd have to preach?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"Well,\" replied his daughter, \"I'll be expected to teach the law of sacrifice. You're not even\npaying your tithing. I'll be asked to teach them about family prayers, and we never have\nfamily prayers. I'll be expected to teach the Word of Wisdom; we're using coffee and tea in\nour home. I'll be expected to teach the importance of giving service in the Church, and you\nare shunning that service. No, Father, I can't go out and be a hypocrite.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI think that father spent a sleepless night. \"The next morning,\" our Japanese sister said,\n\"Father came to me and said, 'You go, my dear, and your father will try to live as his\ndaughter will preach.' \"\n<\/p><p>\nTwo days later, I met her over at Honolulu at a missionary conference, and she had just been\nhome for the first time in nearly two years. And during the course of the conference I\nwhispered to her, \"How did you find things at home?\" She smiled, and tears were in her eyes\nas she said, \"It's all right. Father is, and I'm happy.\"\n<\/p><p>\nYouth that we send out from us rarely ever will be stronger than the kind of homes and\nenvironment from which they come. The challenge of this time, what with military service of\nyoung men eighteen years, young girls disturbed in their social life, is to see to Zion is\nincreased in holiness. We must increase in beauty\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12908\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12908)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12908)\">D&amp;C 82:14<\/a><\/span>).\nOur homes, our quorums, our wards, and\nour stakes must be strengthened. Zion must arise and put on her most beautiful garments.\n<\/p><p>\nCOUNSEL OF SUSANNAH WESLEY\n<\/p><p>\nA short while ago I read wise counsel from a lovely mother, Susannah Wesley, mother of\nJohn Wesley, famed in religious circles. This was what this lovely mother said to her son,\nwhich was a criterion by which he could judge right and wrong, in pleasure, and for that\nmatter in all the affairs of life. These were her words: \n<\/p><p>\nWould you judge the lawfulness or unlawfulness of pleasure? Then use this rule:\nWhatever weakens your reason, impairs the tenderness of your conscience, obscures\nyour sight of God, takes from you your thirst for spiritual things, or increases the\nauthority of your body over your mind, then that thing to you is evil. By this test you\nmay detect evil no matter how subtly or how plausibly temptation may be presented to\nyou.\n<\/p><p>\nOh, I wish that every youth would use that rule and measure everything presented to him in\norder that he might choose the right. God grant that we may strengthen Zion within ourselves,\nthat we might live nobly and prepare to present ourselves in honor at the end of our lives\nhere, before him whose name we bear as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints, I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
