We did this, and I had occasion also to visit the\nheadquarters of this association. And there in the presence of a number of these men, and\nsome of them were ministers, had the opportunity of explaining to them the premise under\nwhich the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had been organized.\n<\/p><p>\nI took occasion at that time to read to them from section twenty of the Doctrine and\nCovenants, and I would like to read to you what I read to them, beginning with verse 7: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And gave unto him [meaning Joseph Smith] commandments which inspired him;<br \/>\n\"And gave him power from on high, by the means which were before prepared, to translate\nthe Book of Mormon;<br \/>\n\"Which contains a record of a fallen people, and the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to\nthe Gentiles and to the Jews also;<br \/>\n\"Which was given by inspiration, and is confirmed to others by the ministering of angels, and\nis declared unto the world by them&mdash;<br \/>\n\"Proving to the world that the holy scriptures are true, and that God does inspire men and call\nthem to his holy work in this age and generation, as well as in generations of old;<br \/>\n\"Thereby showing that he is the same God yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.<br \/>\n\"Therefore, having so great witnesses, by them shall the world be judged, even as many as\nshall hereafter come to a knowledge of this work.<br \/>\n\"And those who receive it in faith, and work righteousness, shall receive a crown of eternal\nlife; <br \/>\n\"But those who harden their hearts in unbelief, and reject it, it shall turn to their own\ncondemnation&mdash;<br \/>\n\"For the Lord God has spoken it; and we, the elders of the church, have heard and bear\nwitness to the words of the glorious Majesty on high, to whom be glory forever and ever.\nAmen\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13717\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13717)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13717)\">D&amp;C 20:7-16<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis had a profound effect upon these men, and I was grateful to leave my witness with them\nas to the premise for the organization of God's Church upon the earth in this day and time.\n<\/p><p>\nSome years ago there appeared an article in <i>Fortune<\/i> magazine, which had to do with the\nfailure, according to the editors and authors of this article, of the Christian churches of\nAmerica to supply the needed inspiration for the direction of the Christian churches in this\nland. This article has very recently been referred to by one of our noted educators from the\nWest Coast, Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul, president of the University of California. I read from\nthis article, which stresses the need of divine direction in the Christian churches of America. I\nquote: \n<\/p><p>\n\"We have the peculiar spectacle of a nation which, to a limited extent, practices Christianity\nwithout actively believing in Christianity. We are asked to turn to the Church for our\nenlightenment, but when we do this we find that the voice of the Church is not inspired. The\nvoice of the Church today is the echo of our own voices. And the result of this experience,\nalready manifest is disillusionment . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"The way out,\" continues Dr. Sproul, \"is the sound of a voice, not our voice, but a voice\ncoming from somewhere not ourselves, in the existence of which we cannot disbelieve.\n<\/p><p>\n\"It is the task of the pastors to hear this voice, cause us to hear it, and to tell us what it says.\nIf they cannot hear it, or if they fail to tell us what it says, we, as laymen, are wholly lost.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Without it we are no more capable of saving the world, than we were capable of creating it\nin the first place.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI think one of the great messages of this Church is to declare unto the world that God has\nraised up a prophet and that there is a need for a prophet of God in this day and age. We go\nto the ends of the earth to proclaim this unto the children of men and if they will but listen to\nthe direction and the inspiration of the prophets of God we could be led from our dilemma\nand from the disillusionment that settles over the earth today.\n<\/p><p>\nI read recently of a statement of Winston Churchill which gives some evidence of the need of\ninspired direction in the earth today, for said he \"As the years go by, the process of\ngovernment&mdash;I suppose in every modern country and certainly in our own&mdash;grows ever more\ncomplicated and burdensome.\n<\/p><p>\n\"I have perhaps a longer experience than almost anyone, and I have never brooded over a\nsituation which demanded more patience, composure, courage and perseverance than that\nwhich unfolds itself before us today.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIs there a need for a prophet of God? The answer is yes. Look at the evidences of this. The\nworld of politics and relationships between nations is not improving since that statement was\nmade, in fact they have grown worse. There is a worldwide lack of trust between peoples.\nWe stand each dawn, as it were, on the brink of open hostilities.\n<\/p><p>\nAtomic and hydrogen power, with their many implements of destruction serve only to add to\nthe menace of our way of living. The pressure conditions under which we live today are\ntaking a tremendous toll in heart and mental disturbances. The status of home life, spiraling\ntrends of drunkenness, surging infidelity in the home of husband and wife, with an over-all\nlaxity of morals among both young and old, increased personal and community delinquencies\nall pointing to a growing disregard for the worth of the individual. One would have to be\nblind not to recognize these disastrous trends and the need of divine direction\nto save those who will hear, understand, and follow the truth. The ancient Prophet Amos\ndeclared, that God would do nothing, save he reveal his mind and will to his servants the\nprophets (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"10413\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10413)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10413)\">Amos 3:7<\/a><\/span>).\nThe need of the mind and will of our Heavenly Father, through his\nservant, a prophet, is greatly in evidence.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to leave my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that God does live and that he and his\nSon, Jesus Christ, are at the helm, and that prophets have been raised up from the very\ninception of this Church, commencing with Joseph Smith and others who have followed him,\nand that we are blessed to have standing at the head of the Church today and directing us, a\nprophet of God, and if the children of men would but listen to the voice of that prophet we\nall could be led away from the difficulties that are oppressing us this very day. I bear this\nrecord in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
