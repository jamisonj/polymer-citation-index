Youth is a time of timelessness when the horizons of age often seem too distant to be noticed.

From reports in books, magazines, and newspapers\u2014especially the youth sections\u2014we learn that they are lewd, obscene, immoral, avaricious, and in some cases even cruel. It is the very life-style we are here to avoid that is paraded before our young people by their celebrated peers. To deflect the admiration of youth from these examples of the ugly life, we must start young. The care and feeding of children must include equal concern for their emotional lives as well as their physical, spiritual, and intellectual lives.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/satans-thrust-youth.p62\" class=\"\">For young people to be <span class=\"emphasis\">in <\/span>the world but not <span class=\"emphasis\">of <\/span>the world has never been more difficult than today. But this burden must be shared by the parents. The family home evening is an important barrier to the works of Satan. The MIA program must protect our youth against every evil influence and should fill a vacuum left by rejecting worldly enticements. And, of course, a great panacea for all problems and personal doubts: prayer\u2014private and family prayer, night and morning.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/satans-thrust-youth.p63\" class=\"\">The critical and complaining adult will be less effective than the interested and understanding. And love and understanding are only effective when they are genuine. And to be genuine they must be motivated by love. We must love our young people, whether they are in righteousness or in error. In this way we can give them a chance to discern and to learn. But we must also give them a fair choice. Today many are not succeeding.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/satans-thrust-youth.p64\" class=\"\">Yes, \u201cThere comes a time when the general defilement of a society becomes so great that the rising generation is put under undue pressure and cannot be said to have a fair choice between the Way of Light and the Way of Darkness.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/satans-thrust-youth.p65\" class=\"\">God grant that we as parents and leaders of youth may have the power and the good common sense to give them \u201ca fair choice,\u201d I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
