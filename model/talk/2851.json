In any event, the charge came to my mind recently as I listened to the report of a returned missionary.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/your-gift-from-god.p7\" class=\"\">He told us that the wife in the family in whose home he and his companion were living was interested in the gospel; her husband was not interested, however. But finally he warmed up a little and said that when the missionaries had nothing else to do he would listen to them. Sometime thereafter when a wet and windy storm drove them in from tracting, finding him alone, they gave him the first missionary lesson. He didn\u2019t exhibit much interest at first, but when they had concluded, he stood up and said, in effect:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/your-gift-from-god.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cDo you know what you have just told me?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/your-gift-from-god.p9\" class=\"\">They thought they did.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/your-gift-from-god.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cDo you believe it?\u201d he asked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/your-gift-from-god.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cYes,\u201d they replied, \u201cwe believe it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/your-gift-from-god.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cWell then,\u201d he declared, \u201cyou don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying.
