Hence I am convinced\nthat he is deserving of a careful, thorough, and honest study by every person interested in his\npersonal well-being. According to first-class evidence, Joseph Smith did actually, really see\nand hear the Father and the Son, two highly glorified beings, they seemed to him, in whose\nimage man himself is made. If this is not a fact, he was the greatest religious fraud this world\nhas ever seen. Between these two positions&mdash;prophet or fraud&mdash;there is no middle ground, or\ncompromise. This is a strong statement, I admit, but certainly a correct one. Which of these\ntwo positions is the right one? If the first one is right, then certainly Joseph Smith's\nteachings should be studied by every human being qualified to study, for Joseph was\nGod-taught and made available to the modern world the knowledge that every person must\nhave, and by which he must live, if he would return from mortality to the celestial kingdom,\nthe realm where God personally lives.\n<\/p><p>\nLORD'S LAW OF HEALTH\n<\/p><p>\nWith this brief introduction, I wish to talk for a few minutes on a phase of one of Joseph\nSmith's revelations, commonly spoken of as the Lord's Law of Health, or otherwise known as\nthe Word of Wisdom.\n<\/p><p>\nBut why the Word of Wisdom as a part of religion? someone may ask. In the language of the\ndocument itself the Word of Wisdom shows:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nAnd those:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments,\nshall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12496\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12496)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12496)\">D&amp;C 89:2,18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd health is an important factor in the work of serving God and man.\n<\/p><p>\nThe apostle Paul asked,\n<\/p><p>\nKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?\n<\/p><p>\nIf any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy,\nwhich temple ye are (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"162\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 162)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(162)\">1 Cor. 3:16-17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow, in order that health may be maintained, it is common knowledge that the laws of health\nmust be observed. Scientists have long taught that law is universal throughout material realms.\nWith this thought in mind the poet wrote of the \"music of the spheres.\" The Prophet Joseph\nSmith taught the universality of spiritual laws when he wrote:\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon\nwhich all blessings are predicated&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nAnd when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is\npredicated (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12559\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12559)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12559)\">D&amp;C 130:20-21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAll over the Church the belief is general that the Word of Wisdom is practically observed if\nthe individual abstains from the use of tea, coffee, liquor, and tobacco. But a careful reading\nof the revelation shows this belief to be erroneous. There is much more to the document than\nabstention from the use of narcotics. Among the statements are these:\n<\/p><p>\nEvery herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used\nwith prudence and thanksgiving.\n<\/p><p>\nYea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of\nman with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly;\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold,\nor famine (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12498\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12498)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12498)\">D&amp;C 89:11-13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIMPORTANCE OF BALANCED DIET\n<\/p><p>\nIt is to flesh as an article in human diet that I wish to direct your attention. It is needless to\nconfess that I am not an authority in the field of nutrition. So I hope you will tolerate my\nquoting freely from writings of men generally accepted as authorities. These authorities say\nthat generally food has more to do with health than any other factor affecting health. But that\nfood may do its most for our health we must have a balanced diet, made up of five essential\nsubstances in the right proportions&mdash;these substances being proteins, fats, carbohydrates,\nminerals, and vitamins.\n<\/p><p>\nQUOTATIONS FROM \"HOW TO LIVE\"\n<\/p><p>\nIn How To Live, perhaps the most widely read and authoritative book in English for the\nlayman on the subject of personal hygiene and published under the auspices of the Life\nExtension Institute, Inc., we find a great fund of reliable information given in simple language\nby the authors, Professor Irving Fisher of Yale University and Dr. Eugene Lyman Fisk,\nmedical director of the Life Extension Institute, Inc. The book was first published in 1915\nunder the auspices of the board of directors of the institute, of which Judge William Howard\nTaft was chairman and writer of the forewords to the first and the fifteenth editions. My\ncitations will be from the fifth printing of the eighteenth edition, 1929. (The most recent\nrevised edition, the twenty-first, was written by Professor Fisher and Dr. Haven Emerson of\nColumbia University, but nothing here quoted is nullified by this edition. )\n<\/p><p>\nAs just stated, the essential foods are proteins, fats, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins.\nProtein is the tissue-building constituent of foods. It is found in meat, eggs, fowls, milk, peas,\nbeans, grains, especially wheat, most vegetables, fruits, etc. Lean meat and the white of eggs\nare particularly high in protein. The book, <i>How To Live<\/i>, page 42, says:\n<\/p><p>\nThey consist entirely of protein and water; also most ordinary foods contain more or less\nprotein.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd the book goes on to say:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . foods should be so selected as to give to the ration the right amount of protein, or\nrepair-foods, on the one hand, and of fats and carbohydrates, or fuel-foods, on the other.\n<\/p><p>\nAccording to what are regarded as the best investigations, the right proportion of protein is\ngenerally about 10 percent of the total number of heat units consumed. This means 10 percent\nof the total nutriment, that is ten calories of protein out of every one hundred calories of food.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd further on the books says:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . a chief and common error of diet consists of using too much protein, two or more times\ntoo much.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd on page 47, we read:\n<\/p><p>\nAt a meeting of the Inter-Allied Council of Physiologists during the World War I, it was\ndecided that meat was not a physiological necessity&mdash;since the proteins of meat can be\nreplaced by those contained in milk, cheese and eggs&mdash;as well as by the proteins of vegetable\norigin.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd why is too much protein injurious? On page 47, we read:\n<\/p><p>\nWhen protein is taken in great excess of the body's need, as is usually the case in the diet of\nAmericans, added work is given the liver and kidneys, the circulation is over-stimulated and\nthe \"factor of safety\" of these organs is exceeded\n<\/p><p>\nAnd on page 68 is the following:\n<\/p><p>\nBefore leaving the subject of intestinal poisoning, we may here again mention the importance\nof avoiding the poisoning that comes from too much protein\n<\/p><p>\nNow please give particular attention to the following, found on page 250:\n<\/p><p>\nEven the most ardent advocates of a meat diet cannot produce a scientific evidence to show\nthat intestinal putrefaction to a high degree due to the presence of meat is in any way\nbeneficial to the organism; hence, in seeking the best form of diet, meat as a source of protein\nmay well be excluded and the requisite protein secured from milk, nuts, cereals, and\nvegetables. If in the average diet a pint of milk daily is substituted for whatever meat portions\nhave theretofore been taken, there would be no danger of protein lack.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd on the following page is found:\n<\/p><p>\nWe have quoted Hubner, one of the world's foremost authorities in hygiene, as condemning\nthe very popular idea that meat is very \"strengthening.\" Actual experiments on this point have\nshown exactly the opposite to be the case.\n<\/p><p>\nThis statement will surprise most people. But the book continues:\n<\/p><p>\nMeat eating and a high-protein diet, instead of increasing one's endurance, have been shown,\nlike alcohol, actually to reduce it.\n<\/p><p>\nThen experiments conducted at Yale University by Professor Fisher are described, after which\nthe book continues (page 252):\n<\/p><p>\nThe experiments furnished a severe test of the claims of the flesh-abstainers. Two\ncomparisons were planned: one between flesh-eating athletes and flesh-abstaining athletes, and\nthe other between flesh-eating athletes and flesh-abstaining sedentary workers. The results\nwould indicate that the users of low-protein and the nonflesh dietaries have far greater\nendurance than those who are accustomed to the ordinary American diet.\n<\/p><p>\nNow let me read to you a few words from the Word of Wisdom, given by the Prophet Joseph\nSmith to the world long before science knew any of the facts that I have just read to you\nfrom <i>How to Live<\/i>. As a promise for observing the Word of Wisdom the revelation says:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the\ncommandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones . . .\n<\/p><p>\nAnd shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12500\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12500)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12500)\">D&amp;C 89:18,20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nDo the Yale experiments and the statements read from <i>How To Live<\/i> confirm or discredit the\nteaching of the Word of Wisdom relative to the eating of meat? How do you account for the\nfact that Joseph Smith could give these truths to the world many years before science knew\nabout them?\n<\/p><p>\n\"HEALTH AND EFFICIENCY\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow I wish to quote from <i>Health and Efficiency<\/i>, a book written for schools by Professor M.\nV. O'Shea of the University of Wisconsin and Dr. J. H. Kellogg, superintendent of the Battle\nCreek Sanitarium, and published by the Macmillan Company in 1927. I believe anyone could\nread this little book on hygiene with a great deal of profit. From the chapter on \"Food and\nEfficiency\" I condense the following statements:\n<\/p><p>\nProteins are body-building materials. They may also be used by the body as fuel, but this\noccurs only in case of necessity. When heat producing foods&mdash;fats and carbohydrates&mdash;are\nburned up proteins are used for fuel. So if the body does not need the protein for repairs it\nwill use it, but it is a bad form of fuel, for it leaves behind what might be called clinkers.\nWhen fats and carbohydrates are consumed, they leave no \"ashes.\" With protein foods the\nstory is quite different. These, when formed, yield substances that are not ready for\nelimination by the kidneys until they have been chemically changed by the liver. These\nproducts are poisonous and circulating through the body are present in excess in the blood of\nheavy meat eaters. The result is that the liver and kidneys are much overworked and thus\nwear out prematurely\n<\/p><p>\nAgain:\n<\/p><p>\nOf the food eaten, a small portion remains behind in the intestine undigested. This is\nparticularly true of protein food, the unused residue of which is usually much greater than that\nof the carbohydrates and fats. When more protein is eaten than needed some of it remains in\nthe large intestine until it is discharged. The warmth of the body causes it to putrefy.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is evident, then, that if one's diet is such that a considerable amount of undigested meat is\nleft to decay in the colon, harmful poisons will be absorbed in the blood and will do harm to\nthe liver, kidneys, blood vessels, and the other tissues.\n<\/p><p>\nDr. Newburgh, a University of Michigan professor, as a result of his researches, has\nconcluded that an excess of protein in the diet resulting from heavy meat eating, is one of the\ncauses of the great increase in recent years of diseases of the kidneys, heart, and\nblood vessels.\n<\/p><p>\nThe foods to be used most sparingly are those which contain a great excess of protein, such as\nmeat, eggs, cheese, and beans. On this account, there are many authorities who think that it\nwould be safer to discard the use of meat altogether than to continue to use it so freely as\nmany Americans are doing.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then the book quotes Dr. McCollum of Johns Hopkins University, an eminent authority\non nutrition as follows:\n<\/p><p>\nI have not the slightest hesitation in saying that a vegetarian diet, supplemented with fairly\nliberal amounts of milk is the most satisfactory type of diet a man can take.\n<\/p><p>\nNext, Professor Chittenden of Yale University is quoted:\n<\/p><p>\nWith vegetables of all kinds and milk, bread, and butter, you have at your command all the\nnecessary resources for a nutritious diet.\n<\/p><p>\nThen the book speaks about a bulletin by the United States Department of Agriculture in\nwhich we are told that\n<\/p><p>\n. . . meat may be omitted from the diet altogether, for it has been determined that all\nnecessary protein and energy may be obtained from other materials.\n<\/p><p>\nAs a final quotation from the book <i>Health and Efficiency<\/i> I give the following:\n<\/p><p>\nEnergy can be gotten from food only after it has become part of a living cell. The excess\nprotein is never assimilated: it never becomes an actual part of the body; it is burned to get\nrid of it, just as rubbish is. Even the heat produced is extra heat which the body does not need\nand so is carried off by an increase in the insensible perspiration. Under conditions of extreme\nexposure to cold the heat might be of service. On the other hand, in case of fever, and in hot\nweather, the heat excess induced by ton much protein may do great harm.\n<\/p><p>\nMEATS TO BE USED SPARINGLY\n<\/p><p>\nNow I read again the words of the revelation to the Prophet:\n<\/p><p>\n. . . .they [meats] are to be used sparingly; And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be\nused, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12499\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12499)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12499)\">D&amp;C 89:12-13<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nLatter-day Saints, why should you complain of the scarcity or high price of flesh foods? Have\nyou not known that in any case you should eat them sparingly? The Lord told you so. I have\nquoted from some of the highest authorities in the world to the effect that they are not\nessential to your physical well-being. But Americans did not know this until God revealed it\nto them through his Prophet, Joseph Smith.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now I sum up. Proteins are the building materials of the body, the needed amount of\nwhich is largely determined by age and the kind of physical activity: but for the average adult\nit is about 10 percent of food intake. More than this should be avoided. Meat is the richest\nsource of proteins but sizable amounts are found in the excellent foods&mdash;eggs, milk, cheese,\nbeans, nuts, wheat, and more or less in other cereals, vegetables, and fruits. Americans eat too\nmuch meat, a non-essential in human diet, because all the proteins needed are available in the\nother foods just named.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord help us to accept and live by every word he gives to us by the mouths of his\nholy prophets, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
