Hunter, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1969, pp. 111-113<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nNot long ago one of our national publications reported an extensive study of some\nconditions plaguing our modern society, conditions which give us great concern. Crimes of\nviolence are increasing at an alarming rate. There is disrespect for law and order, civil\ndisobedience, expanded use of drugs and barbiturates, increase in venereal diseases, and an\naccelerating divorce rate. The upward trend in petty thefts, burglary, gambling, riots on school\ncampuses, and protests against standards which have long prevailed as acceptable is alarming.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Faith in fellowmen<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nCan we say that because news media are filled with such accounts, there is a universal\nand basic social change in thinking and conduct? Can we believe that because there are some\nwho have no regard for the law or the rights of others, or who advocate a new morality, this\nrepresents a new concept of right and wrong? Although we cannot hide our heads in the sand\nand disregard present-day problems, I for one have not lost faith in my fellowmen.\n<\/p><p>\nAmong our modern campus youth are some who take great delight in attracting attention by\npursuing a course against the conventional. By a misguided sense of direction, this vocal\nminority often campaigns for a new freedom disassociated from any sense of responsibility.\nFor every one of these there are thousands of young people who want to live right and do\nright. They have the desire to take their place in a responsible society and to live under a\ncode of high morality. We are proud of them. These are the great hope of the future. I only\nwish their good works and their aspirations could receive the same \"equal time\" as is allotted\nto those of opposing political philosophies.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A sense of right and wrong<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat makes the difference? What causes persons to travel divergent courses on moral\nissues? Is it because of a difference in belief as to whether or not a thing is right or wrong, or\nis it a total disregard for the right?\n<\/p><p>\nWe teach little children the difference between right and wrong, and a conscience awakens in\nthem. There seems to be in each of God's children this monitoring device we call a\nconscience, which tracks our thoughts and actions and raises a caution when there is\ncontemplation of the improper, unconventional, or immoral. Merely living with other people\nteaches us the difference between right and wrong. There is something lacking in the\nexperience of an adult who must be taken into custody and punished or restrained for\nviolating the rights of others. But again, these people are a small minority. I think we would\nagree that most people have a real sense of right and wrong and a sincere desire to follow the\nright. They have an understanding of moral responsibility. Sometimes we refer to this as\nethics, the science of moral duty or ideal human character.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>A code of ethics<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI believe most persons follow a strict code of ethics. They are governed by this great\nethical rule: So live as to invoke the best in others and therefore in yourself. Surely this is\ncommendable and would enhance relationships in our complex society if\neveryone had a sincere feeling of such moral responsibility.\n<\/p><p>\nEthical theory is the basis for righteous government and for the formulation of fair and\nequitable jurisprudence. It is the basis for all moral, social, and economic systems.\n<\/p><p>\nWe would agree that to follow a strict code of moral ethics, society would reach a high state\nof perfection and many of the present-day problems would be solved, but is ethics alone\nsufficient to attain our goals in life? To those who have no belief in life after mortality, ethics\nmay be sufficient to fulfill the requirements of conduct and responsibility. There may be some\nwho believe in a life hereafter, yet feel that ethics is sufficient for salvation. Can this be true\nwithout also living the other commandments of God?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Meaning of true religion<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a great difference between ethics and religion. There is a distinction between\none whose life is based on mere ethics and one who lives a truly religious life. We have a\nneed for ethics, but true religion includes the truths of ethics and goes far beyond. True\nreligion has its roots in the belief in a supreme being. Christian religion is based upon a belief\nin God the Eternal Father and in his Son Jesus Christ and in the word of the Lord as\ncontained in scripture. Religion also goes beyond theology. It is more than just a belief in\nDeity; it is the practice of the belief. James E. Talmage said, \"One may be deeply versed in\ntheological lore, and yet be lacking in religious and even moral character. If theology be\ntheory then religion is practice; if theology be precept, religion is example\" (<i>Articles of Faith<\/i>,\np. 5).\n<\/p><p>\nTrue religion to the Christian is demonstrated by a real belief in God and the realization that\nwe are responsible to him for our acts and conduct. A person who lives such religion is\nwilling to live the principles of the gospel of Christ and walk uprightly before the Lord in all\nthings according to his revealed law. This brings to a man or a woman a sense of peace and\nfreedom from confusion in life and gives an assurance of eternal life hereafter. The Lord said,\n\". . . Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth\nof God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35884\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35884)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35884)\">Matt. 4:4<\/a><\/span>).\nA code of morals is not wholly sufficient. For the same reason man\ncannot be saved by bread alone, he cannot be saved by a code of ethics.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Religion a vibrant influence<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn order to be effective in one's life, religion must be a vibrant influence. It must be\nan influence that becomes a part of one's thinking and conduct. There is purpose in man's\nsojourn in mortality. He is placed here for a definite reason, in accordance with God's great\nplan. We read in Genesis the story of the creation: \"And the Lord God said, Behold, the man\nis become as one of us, to know good and evil\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23798\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23798)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23798)\">Gen. 3:22<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nTo learn the difference between good and evil is one of the great purposes for man to have\nmortal life, yet he is given his freedom of choice with the promise of eternal blessings if he\nobeys the laws of God.\n<\/p><p>\nA true religious faith teaches us that there are certain principles that must be accepted and\nobeyed. We must have faith in God the Eternal Father and in his Son Jesus Christ and his\natoning sacrifice. This must be followed by repentance from all sin, then baptism by\nimmersion after the example of the Savior by one having authority, and the laying on of\nhands for the gift of the Holy Ghost (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6871\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6871)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6871)\">A of F 1:4<\/a><\/span>).\nOther things are necessary, including a contrite spirit, a\nhumble heart, obedience to the ordinances and principles of the gospel, and faithfulness to the\nend. This encompasses the choosing of right over wrong, following good, and abstaining from\nevil.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Church restored in latter days<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nEthics alone will not accomplish all these things for us, but an active religion will add\nto ethics the principles and ordinances of the gospel, which, if obeyed, will open the doors of\neternal salvation, provided such religion is ordained of God and not of man's\ncreation. I bear witness to you that the Church established by Christ and taken from the earth\nbecause of the apostasy of men has been restored in these latter days in the same manner as\nforetold by the prophets of old and by the other statements of scripture; that God has spoken\nto his servants in our day and is now speaking. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints invites all persons to listen to the story of the restoration of the gospel, the story of a\nreligion vibrant and vital in the lives of thousands of persons of faith, testimony, and devotion\nto the principles of the gospel taught by the Church of Christ.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Peace from living gospel<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe troubles of the world often expressed in screaming headlines should remind us to\nseek for the peace that comes from living the simple principles of the gospel of Christ. The\nvociferous minorities will not unsettle our peace of soul if we love our fellowmen and have\nfaith in the atoning sacrifice of the Savior and the quiet assurance he gives of life everlasting.\nWhere do we find such faith in a troubled world? The Lord said, \"Ask, and it shall be given\nyou; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it\nshall be opened\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31764\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31764)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31764)\">Luke 11:9-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt is my humble and sincere testimony to you that God does truly live a kind, loving Father. I\nknow that his Son Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, and that through belief in him and\nkeeping his commandments we will have life everlasting. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. \n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
