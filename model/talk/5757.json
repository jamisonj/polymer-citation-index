I was fascinated by the regularity with which the gigantic waves consistently moved forward to break on the shoreline. It reminded me of the constancy of the plan of the Lord, with its fixed, eternal law, and the security of enduring justice and the tenderness of mercy when earned by obedience. I noticed that each wave would crest at a different point on the horizon to find its unique path to shore. Some cascaded over rocks, leaving rivulets of foaming, white water. Others burst on the shore in individual patterns. They slid up the moistened sand with playful frothy edges, then bubbled and swirled as they receded.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/finding-joy-in-life.p4\" class=\"\">I thought of the unending variety of possibilities the Lord has provided for us. We have so much freedom, so many opportunities to develop our unique personalities and talents, our individual memories, our personalized contributions. Since there would be no further opportunity to observe the majestic sea, I tried to imagine the glorious panorama the brilliant sun would later create. As I watched this magnificent scene in reverence, a window formed in the clouds; the glistening rays of the rising sun broke through the overcast sky, transforming everything with its luminescence, its color, its life. It was as if the Lord wanted to share an additional blessing, a symbol of the light of His teachings that gives brilliance and hope to everyone it touches. Tears of gratitude formed for this wondrous world in which we live, for the extraordinary beauty our Heavenly Father so freely shares with all who are willing to see. Truly, life is beautiful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/finding-joy-in-life.p5\" class=\"\">Do you take time to discover each day how beautiful your life can be? How long has it been since you watched the sun set? The departing rays kissing the clouds, trees, hills, and lowlands good night, sometimes tranquilly, sometimes with exuberant bursts of color and form. What of the wonder of a cloudless night when the Lord unveils the marvels of His heavens\u2014the twinkling stars, the moonlight rays\u2014to ignite our imagination with His greatness and glory? How captivating to watch a seed planted in fertile soil germinate, gather strength, and send forth a tiny, seemingly insignificant sprout. Patiently it begins to grow and develop its own character led by the genetic code the Lord has provided to guide its development. With care it surely will become what it is destined to be: a lily, crowned with grace and beauty; a fragrant spearmint plant; a peach; an avocado; or a beautiful blossom with unique delicacy, hue, and fragrance. When last did you observe a tiny rosebud form? Each day it develops new and impressive character, more promise of beauty until it becomes a majestic rose. You are one of the noblest of God\u2019s creations. His intent is that your life be gloriously beautiful regardless of your circumstances. As you are grateful and obedient, you can become all that God intends you to be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/finding-joy-in-life.p6\" class=\"\">Sadness, disappointment, and severe challenge are <span class=\"emphasis\">events<\/span> in life, not life itself. I do not minimize how hard some of these events are. They can extend over a long period of time, but they should not be allowed to become the confining center of everything you do. The Lord inspired Lehi to declare the fundamental truth, \u201cMen are, that they might have joy.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-96905_000_013\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4637\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4637)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4637)\">2 Ne. 2:25<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> That is a conditional statement: \u201cthey <span class=\"emphasis\">might<\/span> have joy.\u201d It is not conditional for the Lord. His intent is that each of us finds joy.

Cast on the ground, it is seen in perspective. Likewise, problems or trials in our lives need to be viewed in the perspective of scriptural doctrine. Otherwise they can easily overtake our vision, absorb our energy, and deprive us of the joy and beauty the Lord intends us to receive here on earth. Some people are like rocks thrown into a sea of problems. They are drowned by them. Be a cork.

A lovely woman with an aggressive terminal disease consistently found joy in life. She understood the plan of happiness, had received the temple ordinances, and was doing her best to qualify for the promised blessings. Her personal journal records: \u201cIt is a beautiful fall day. I picked up the mail and sat down on the swing. I was so happy and content in the warm sun, the sweet smell of nature and the trees around me. I just sat and gloried in the fact that I am still alive on this beautiful earth. \u2026 The Lord is so good to me. How I thank him that I am still here and feeling so good.

Children haven\u2019t yet learned to be depressed by concentrating on the things they don\u2019t have. They find joy in what is available to them. I remember a small boy playing along a riverbank. He had tied a piece of fishing line to the ends of two discarded soft-drink cans. He threw one can over a limb, then filled it with water. He would pull on the other can, then let it go. The weight of the first can would draw the second one up as it fell. He laughed and danced with glee.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/finding-joy-in-life.p14\" class=\"\">Simple, rejuvenating experiences surround us. They can be safety valves to keep the tension down and the spirit up. Don\u2019t concentrate on what you don\u2019t have or have lost. The Lord promised the obedient to share all that He possesses with them. You may temporarily lack here, but in the next life, if you prove yourself worthy by living valiantly, a fulness will be your blessing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/finding-joy-in-life.p15\" class=\"\">Find the compensatory blessings in your life when, in the wisdom of the Lord, He deprives you of something you very much want.

With the loss of a dear one, He deepens the bonds of love, enriches memories, and kindles hope in a future reunion.
