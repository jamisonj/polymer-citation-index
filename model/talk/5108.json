But these are the visible connections. Invisible but just as tangible are the connections of spirit and sisterhood that unite us now and during this coming year in which we celebrate the sesquicentennial of Relief Society. Wherever you are, whatever you are wearing, whatever language you are hearing, you are part of a powerful force of joy, peace, and goodness. We are here to rejoice together \u201cin every good thing.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21374\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21374)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21374)\">Deut. 26:11<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p5\" class=\"\">It is the strength and joy from a Christ-centered and Christlike life that gives us reason to rejoice.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9851\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9851)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9851)\">Alma 26:35<\/a><\/span>.)

How many are with you? There may be thousands, as there are in this tabernacle. If you are one of many, give thanks to our Father. If you are one of few, praise him! There were only twenty in Nauvoo in 1842. Be the Nauvoo generation in your ward or branch. Remember you are not alone. You are one of a sisterhood of three million women.

Let us rejoice in the unified sisterhood we share.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p9\" class=\"\">Second, let us rejoice in our diversity. I grew up a Buddhist, the daughter of a Japanese plantation laborer in Mahukona, a tiny village which no longer exists, on the big island of Hawaii. My first exposure to Christianity came during the annual Christmas pageant organized by Captain Beck, who was in charge of the plantation. Every year, there was a little nativity play, the singing of Christmas carols, and wonderful presents from a mysterious fat man in a red suit and a white beard.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p10\" class=\"\">When I was about seven, Captain Beck asked me to be the angel in the nativity play. I didn\u2019t know what an angel was, but I was proud to be chosen and worked hard on my speech. And it <span class=\"emphasis\">was<\/span> hard work. My native language was a combination of Japanese and pidgin, and here I had to memorize strange, seventeenth-century King James English. I was just a skinny little seven-year-old in a white cheesecloth costume with crooked tinsel wings and a wobbly tinsel halo on my head. But when the big night came, I was ready.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cFear not,\u201d I said. \u201cFor, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy. \u2026 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32410\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32410)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32410)\">Luke 2:10<\/a><\/span>.) I didn\u2019t know who David was or Christ. I only knew Buddha. I didn\u2019t know what swaddling clothes were or why the baby was in a manger. I didn\u2019t know what shepherds were or why they were afraid or what good tidings were. It was only later, when I became acquainted with the Church at age eleven and joined the Church at age fifteen, that I realized that baby was the Son of God and that the good tidings were those of the gospel. Then I understood my \u201creason to rejoice\u201d [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1992\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1992)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1992)\">1 Ne. 8:3<\/a><\/span>] in Christ, the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p12\" class=\"\">Again, look around the room you are in. Do you see women of different ages, races, or different backgrounds in the Church? Of different educational, marital, and professional experiences? Women with children? Women without children? Women of vigorous health and those who are limited by chronic illness or handicaps? Rejoice in the diversity of our sisterhood! It is the diversity of colors in a spectrum that makes a rainbow. It is the diversity in our circumstances that gives us compassionate hearts. It is the diversity of our spiritual gifts that benefits the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p13\" class=\"\">When I was on the Primary General Board, Patricia Kelsey Graham, a friend and a former board member, wrote a song for the new children\u2019s songbook that I just love, called \u201cWe Are Different.\u201d Listen to its message about knowing, helping, and loving, as Kerstin Larson and Maryanne Featherstone sing it for us, accompanied by Sister Graham:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I know you, and you know me.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">We are as diff\u2019rent as the sun and the sea.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I know you, and you know me,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And that\u2019s the way it is supposed to be.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I help you, and you help me.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">We learn from problems, and we\u2019re starting to see.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I help you, and you help me,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And that\u2019s the way it is supposed to be.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I love you, and you love me.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">We reach together for the best we can be.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">I love you, and you love me,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And that\u2019s the way it is supposed to be.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">(<span class=\"emphasis\">Children\u2019s Songbook,<\/span> p. 263.)<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p27\" class=\"\">Did you get that message?

I do! Our callings give us many opportunities for service. The sesquicentennial this next year will see many compassionate service and community service projects. Make these personal! Get involved! Don\u2019t leave all of the decisions to the ward and stake leaders. I want you to remember that the Relief Society began because one woman\u2014a Miss Cook\u2014we don\u2019t even know her full name\u2014talked to her employer, Sarah M. Kimball, and the two of them devised a way to provide shirts for the men working on the Nauvoo Temple. Be a Miss Cook! See a need. Talk to your sisters in the Relief Society. Combine your strengths. Find collective ways to serve that you individually feel good about. Service should be as different as the needs of your community and the talents of your sisters.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p30\" class=\"\">Remember, our real calling to be a compassionate Christian came when we stepped out of the waters of baptism. The gift of the Holy Ghost is ours by right of confirmation. We don\u2019t need to check it out of the meetinghouse library. We don\u2019t need a bishop\u2019s assignment to be kind. We don\u2019t need to sign up to be thoughtful. We don\u2019t need to be sustained by our wards to be sensitive. Rejoice in the power you have within you from Christ to be a nucleus of love, forgiveness, and compassion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1991\/11\/rejoice-in-every-good-thing.p31\" class=\"\">Do not feel that your gift is insignificant.
