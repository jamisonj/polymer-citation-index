It would be a great satisfaction to me, and doubtless instructive to this congregation, if I could lay before them those things that are revolving in my mind.

My mind was contracted at that time, and I knew but little of the things of God. I will here remark that I do not profess to know much now; still I understand them more perfectly, and I take a more comprehensive view of God and godliness than I did, or was capable of doing when I first received the light of truth. Instead of becoming dark in my mind and growing stereotyped in my ways, I have expanded with the increase of my experience. I feel more acutely, I see more clearly, and I comprehend more perfectly the principles <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"327b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD08\/JoD08_0327.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;327b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/3201\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> that pertain to life.

The large roots of a tree receive their nourishment through the little fibers, and they receive it from the fountain; and then that nourishment is sent through the main trunk of the tree into the limbs, branches, and twigs.

Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. If ye abide in me, and my words abide you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.&#x201D; (John, chap. 15, verses 1-7.)<span class=\"citation\" id=\"70113\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 70113)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(70113)\">John 15:1-7<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v8n1772\"> This is precisely the position we occupy in the Church of Christ.

If we take this course, we shall live and prosper, and bear off the kingdom independent of those that do evil, for God will nourish and cherish those who do right. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v8n1775\"> Supposing we compare this Church to a tree, and suppose that one-fourth of the limbs are dead, what use are they to the tree? They are lifeless; and, consequently, the sooner they are taken away the better for the health of the tree. Is there anything lost by lopping off those lifeless limbs? No; for the power and strength that was formerly in the whole tree will enter into that part which is left. Do you not go and clip off the small sprouts, and sometimes some of the bunches of grapes from your vines, in order to make the rest of the vine and the fruit grow larger and stronger? Upon the same principle, this Church has to be proven; for the work of God must and will roll on, and all the opposition in the world cannot stop it. It is a kingdom that is established to remain upon the earth until it subdues every other kingdom and brings them into subjection to the law of God. I know this just as well as I know that I stand here today, and my desire is that you may know it also, and that you may become as the heart of one man.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"55580\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55580)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55580)\">2 Sam. 19:14<\/a><\/span> Jesus says, If you are not one, you are not mine.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"85120\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 85120)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(85120)\">D&amp;C 38:27<\/a><\/span> For instance, suppose I come into this stand and offer up a prayer, it is the duty of all present to join with me not only in the sentiments, but to actually allow the very words to pass <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"329b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD08\/JoD08_0329.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;329b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/3199\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> silently through their minds.

No: that doctrine stands good, and will forever remain so. Some suppose that the ten commandments given through Moses have been done away; but I can inform you that they are still in force.
