Now we had chapels; now the people had freedom. They had a temple. Germany was no longer separated by political boundaries but had become one nation. The youth were now adults with children of their own.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/pathways-to-perfection.p58\" class=\"\">Following a large and inspirational conference, a mother and her daughter sought me out to speak to me. The daughter, who was about your age and who spoke some English, said to me, \u201cPresident Monson, do you remember long ago holding a brief gathering of youth following a district conference, where you gave to each boy and each girl two sticks of chewing gum?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/pathways-to-perfection.p59\" class=\"\">I responded, \u201cOh, yes, I surely do remember.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/pathways-to-perfection.p60\" class=\"\">She continued, \u201cMy mother was one to whom you gave that gift. She told me that she rationed in little pieces one stick of gum. She mentioned how sweet to the taste it was and so precious to her.\u201d Then, under the approving smile of her dear mother, she handed to me a small box. As I opened the lid of the box, there I beheld the other stick of gum, still with its wrapper after nearly 20 years. And then she said, \u201cMy mother and I want you to have this,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/pathways-to-perfection.p61\" class=\"\">The tears flowed; embraces followed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/pathways-to-perfection.p62\" class=\"\">The mother then spoke to me: \u201cBefore you came to our conference so many years ago, I had prayed to my Heavenly Father to know that He indeed cared about me. I saved that gift so that I might remember and teach my daughter that Heavenly Father does hear our prayers.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/pathways-to-perfection.p63\" class=\"\">I hold before you tonight that gift\u2014even a symbol of faith and assurance of the heavenly help our Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, will provide you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/05\/pathways-to-perfection.p64\" class=\"\">On this Easter eve, may our thoughts turn to Him who atoned for our sins, who showed us the way to live, how to pray, and who demonstrated by His own actions how we might do so. Born in a stable, cradled in a manger, this Son of God\u2014even Jesus Christ the Lord\u2014beckons to each of us to follow Him. \u201cOh, sweet the joy this sentence gives: \u2018I know that my Redeemer lives!\u2019\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote15-22905_000_041\">15<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Samuel Medley, \u201cI Know That My Redeemer Lives,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns, <\/span>no. 136.]<\/span><\/sup> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-22905_000_041\"><a name=\"-22905_000_041\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-22905_000_041\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"emphasis\">Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/span> ed.
