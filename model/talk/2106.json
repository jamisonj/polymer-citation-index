We of the Presiding Bishopric commend you young men of the Aaronic Priesthood for being here tonight. The Lord is pleased to have you where you belong at this hour.

Do you think that there might be a possibility that you have not only been called but may be chosen as well? Why not! You are one out of five who made a decision to be here in this great meeting. For each of you here, four others who were invited apparently decided that there was something more important to do than attend this priesthood meeting. I do not know how you answered those previous statements about your attendance here tonight, but one thing is crystal clear to me: either you wanted to be here or most certainly the Lord wanted you here, and you had better get excited about it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cBehold, there are many called, but few are chosen.

Listen carefully, young men. This could well be one of the most important lessons of your life, and it comes directly from the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cThat the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15814\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15814)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15814)\">D&amp;C 121:34\u201336<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p22\" class=\"\">Well, it is exciting that you are here; you are special!

No priesthood obligation is more important. The scriptures say something very similar but in another way that I like very much: \u201c\u2026 when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31828\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31828)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31828)\">Luke 22:32<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p24\" class=\"\">No one takes upon himself the covenant of baptism nor the honor of the priesthood except he also receives the obligations associated with Church membership and priesthood affiliation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p25\" class=\"\">The world today tells you to leave your friend alone. He has the right to come and go as he pleases. The world tells you that persuasion to attend church or priesthood meeting or to discard a bad habit might lead to frustration and undue pressures; but again I repeat the word of the Lord: You are your brother\u2019s keeper, and when you are converted, you have an obligation to strengthen your brother.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cBut bishop,\u201d you say, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to say or how to go about it. I am just a deacons quorum president.\u201d And to this the Lord answers that he gives no assignment to the children of men except he prepares a way for them to accomplish that which he has given them to do. He also says: \u201cTherefore, verily I say unto you, lift up your voices unto this people; speak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts, and you shall not be confounded before men;<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cFor it shall be given you in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p28\" class=\"\">Now at this point the Lord gives a commandment that we must speak in his name with solemnity of heart and in the spirit of meekness, and then he concludes with this promise:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p29\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 inasmuch as ye do this the Holy Ghost shall be shed forth in bearing record unto all things whatsoever ye shall say.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15798\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15798)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15798)\">D&amp;C 100:5\u20138<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p30\" class=\"\">Following this divine formula will take your contact with a friend out of the usual lip-to-ear communication category. With the help of the Holy Ghost, there will be a penetration into the heart of your friend. He will be persuaded through a wonderful spiritual process that is reserved for worthy members of the Church. It is the same process by which converts are brought into the Church and will be an important spiritual gift for each of you to develop and improve on a continuing basis.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p31\" class=\"\">Yes, the Church has need of every member, and the list of indifferent members is much too long; it concerns the First Presidency; it concerns the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p32\" class=\"\">There will not be a sign or miracle in the heavens to wake people up. It was decided aeons ago that people would be helped by people so far as the Lord\u2019s work is concerned. This is an eternal principle and process: \u201c\u2026 when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\u201d The task is largely up to those of us who are here tonight, and the responsibility is upon the newest deacon as well as the high priest of longest standing. While I have directed my comments primarily to the Aaronic Priesthood\u2014Youth, certainly every principle applies to all of us involved in this great work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p33\" class=\"\">May I conclude with a word of caution as the Lord gave it to the Prophet Joseph Smith.

Live beyond his grasp, for I can promise you that there are limits beyond which Satan cannot reach. He will not have claim on the righteous. The challenge for each of us is to stand worthy that we might better assist our brother back into the circle of activity, and may our efforts to do so be centered in that glorious revelation which is pure poetry in a scriptural setting:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p35\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p36\" class=\"\">\u201cThe Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15818\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15818)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15818)\">D&amp;C 121:45\u201346<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/12\/strengthen-thy-brethren.p37\" class=\"\">What a promise!
