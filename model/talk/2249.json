I am among friends. I know that no one loves me more than these brethren who are sitting before you, and I love them. Nearly all of them have visited our home and stayed with us and left their blessings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/to-serve-the-master.p4\" class=\"\">When President Lee called me to be a stake president about sixteen years ago, I remember on the way home he said, \u201cPresident Stone, I want you to prepare now for the day when you will be released.\u201d And I assured him that I was ready any time the Brethren wanted to release me. But you know this time when he called me the other day, he didn\u2019t say a word about that. Later he told me the appointment was for life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/to-serve-the-master.p5\" class=\"\">I feel humble, grateful, and assure you and the Brethren of my willingness to serve, to devote my time, energy, and means for the upbuilding of the kingdom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/to-serve-the-master.p6\" class=\"\">The Savior on one occasion, realizing the many temptations that we are faced with in this life, made this statement: \u201c\u2026 seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36134\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36134)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36134)\">Matt. 6:33<\/a><\/span>.) We have tried to live by that rule in our family. My sons, who have both been mission presidents, used to quote that to me when I was talking to them about their future.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/to-serve-the-master.p7\" class=\"\">Now, I want you all to remember the program of prospective elders, and I am going to tell you why. I was a prospective elder when I met my wife in Blackfoot, Idaho; and after I had courted her for some time and decided (and let her know) that she was the girl of my dreams, she let me know in no uncertain terms that I had to \u201cshape up.\u201d A temple marriage was the only marriage she was interested in.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/to-serve-the-master.p8\" class=\"\">After shaping up, I was ordained an elder and secured a temple recommend. We were sealed for time and eternity in the Salt Lake Temple April 23, 1924. I am very grateful for my eternal companion and for my family, including fourteen grandchildren.

I was having difficulty in getting it into black figures. I don\u2019t like to operate in the red, and I went to my Heavenly Father on bended knees and made a covenant with him that if he would bless me with inspiration and guidance to make that business successful, I would serve him and I would be liberal with my time and means for the up-building of the kingdom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/to-serve-the-master.p11\" class=\"\">The Lord did bless us abundantly, and I now pledge to President Lee, President Tanner, President Romney, and all these Brethren that I shall put forth my best efforts to fulfill this new assignment.
