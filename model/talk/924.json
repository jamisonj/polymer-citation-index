Ivins, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1958, pp. 49-51<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy beloved brethren and sisters, it is almost a frightening situation to face you and realize the\nobligation that that implies on my part.  I seek an interest in your faith and prayers that\nanything that I may say may be directed by the Spirit of God our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nFirst, I desire to say to Sister Bennion, Sister McKay, and Sister Kirkham, that I loved their\nhusbands dearly and miss their presence today and hope that God will comfort the sisters in\nthe absence of these wonderful men.\n<\/p><p>\nAs you have been told, I am a member of the First Council of the Seventy, a group selected\nto proclaim the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, and I am always interested in the progress that\nthat great movement makes. There are many ways of doing it, of course; there are many\nfields of labor in which we embark to spread a knowledge of the restored gospel of Jesus\nChrist.\n<\/p><p>\nI have enjoyed the remarks of President Clark.  I believe that there has come into my heart\nthrough inspiration and revelation a testimony that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he has\nworked out for us the means by which we can return to the presence of God, even in\nexaltation.\n<\/p><p>\nLast night we had a very interesting missionary meeting, and from my point of view, one of\nthe most pleasing features of it was the very sweet and humble testimony of a new member of\nthe Church as to the joys and the satisfactions that have come into his heart after having\nfound what he called the pearl of great price\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34871\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34871)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34871)\">Matt. 13:46<\/a><\/span>).\nThat comes about because the priesthood of\nGod has been restored to the earth.  The men who hold that priesthood have the obligation,\nwhich is really a privilege, of carrying to the world a knowledge of the plan of life and\nsalvation, which through experience and observation I can testify is really true and effective in\nthe lives of men and women who accept it and live it.  People who accept that testimony have\nthe privilege of coming into the fold and enjoying the many blessings that can result through\nthe ministry of the priesthood of God.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is a wonderful responsibility to hold that priesthood.  It is a tremendous opportunity that we\nhave in its administration, not only for the benefit of others who have not understood it and\nappreciated it, but for our own sakes as well.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is now twenty-four years since I first stood at this pulpit and bore my testimony to you.  In\nthat time I have had the pleasure of ministering among the people of the stakes and the wards,\nand I have been in the territory of all the mission fields of Mexico, Canada, and the United\nStates.  I have seen it effective in the lives of people, and verily it is, as we were told last\nnight, a pearl of great price which is within the reach of all who will strive\nto get it.\n<\/p><p>\nNow the pearl of great price is not a bound volume. We have one we call the Pearl of Great\nPrice, of course, but that is not the pearl of great price to which I refer. The pearl of great\nprice&mdash;what is it?  It is the opportunity, I believe, to earn an exaltation in the kingdom of\nGod, which comes to us as a merciful gift from Christ our Lord. Now, there are many others\nwho have the privilege of earning that great gift.\n<\/p><p>\nI like to think of the pearl of great price as being in escrow, brethren and sisters, and we can\nonly receive it&mdash;and perhaps we will not know whether or not we have done it successfully\nuntil the end of our days&mdash;by obtaining and exercising and magnifying the offices of the\npriesthood.  That is what it means, brethren and sisters, the opportunity of the priesthood\nmagnified in the lives of men and women, and the exaltation that can come about through that\nexercise.\n<\/p><p>\nTo me that is the pearl of great price. It will never be retrieved from escrow until God gives\nus the word of commendation for a life well lived.\n<\/p><p>\nThere are many, many men in the priesthood of God; we were told yesterday that there are\nalmost 203,000 men in the Melchizedek Priesthood, and those men have that opportunity and\nthat responsibility.  As I have moved about among the stakes and checked in recent years, I\nhave discovered, however, that there are many people who have gone through the formality of\nhaving that blessing bestowed upon them who evidently do not appreciate it.  I have come to\nthink that the Melchizedek Priesthood, perhaps, in certain sections, is the most unappreciated\ngift that we have.  In many sections where I have been there are at least thirty percent of the\nelders who are reported inactive.  Of course, I do not know just what \"inactivity\" means, but\ncertain it is that when they are reported as such they are not striving fully to magnify their\ncalling.\n<\/p><p>\nI like to suggest to those people the advantage of doing it&mdash;to hold up to them an incentive\nfor it, and I would like to read you a little from the Doctrine and Covenants, which sets up\nthat privilege: \n<\/p><p>\nFor whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken,\nand the magnifying their calling [mind you, the magnifying of their calling], are\nsanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.<br \/>\nThey become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the\nchurch and kingdom, and the elect of God.\n<\/p><p>\nNow that means, to become the elect of God one has to magnify his calling in the priesthood.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;<br \/>\nFor he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;<br \/>\nAnd he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;<br \/>\nAnd he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my\nFather hath shall be given unto him.<br \/>\nAnd this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.<br \/>\nTherefore, all those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my\nFather, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13651\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13651)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13651)\">D&amp;C 84:33-40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNow that, my brethren and sisters, is the blessing that may be obtained by magnifying the\ncalling we have in the priesthood.  Two hundred and three thousand men have that\nopportunity. Two hundred and three thousand men, if they live to avail themselves of all of\nthe privileges of the Melchizedek Priesthood, will be able to take from escrow that pearl of\ngreat price which is, in my opinion, exaltation in the kingdom of God our Heavenly Father.\n<\/p><p>\nThe culminating privilege in the testimony of that fine brother last night was the fact that he\nhad been able to take his wife and children to the temple in Los Angeles, to be sealed to his\nwife and have his children sealed to him.  In many, many meetings which I have attended,\nmeetings of elders and their wives and of reclaimed members of the Church, if you will\npermit that expression, the culminating blessing to which these brethren have testified is the\nprivilege of being sealed to their wives and having their children sealed to them in the temple\nof God; and still, not fifty percent of our people who marry avail\nthemselves of that privilege. All that our Father hath shall be given to him who magnifies that\ncalling, and that means that he shall take his wife to the temple, because we are told also that\nmen who succeed in fully living up to all of the privileges and responsibilities of the\nMelchizedek Priesthood shall become gods with the power of eternal increase. That is the\npearl of great price, brethren and sisters.\n<\/p><p>\nThen, why should we not strive, once we have been offered that privilege, to magnify it?\n<\/p><p>\nNow it is our duty, the duty of those of us who strive to do it, to help others to realize the\nimportance of it and then give aid and succor where it is necessary to strengthen in their\ndetermination these people who have not yet seen fit to qualify for all these blessings.  We\nhave many of them, yes, many of them, and who are they? They are our brothers, our\ncousins, our uncles, and in cases, our fathers. I had an elder in my chair, setting him apart one\nday, and asked his father if he could help me, it being a Melchizedek Priesthood function, and\nhe said, \"No.\" I said, \"Well, brother, you have to be careful, because as soon as this son of\nyours gets in the mission field he is going to start to work on you to convince you of these\nthings.\" He said, \"Brother Ivins, he is not waiting to get in the mission field; he is starting\nnow.\"\n<\/p><p>\nWell, there we are, brethren and sisters.  That is just a typical instance of many men who are\nwilling that their sons should go out and serve in this cause and are hopeful that their sons\nwill be able to live better lives than they have.\n<\/p><p>\nOn another occasion, as one of those fathers left my office, I said, \"Now, the next time you\nbring a son in, and you say it is going to be soon, be sure that you can help me.\" He said, \"I\nwill.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, brethren and sisters, we all know that these things are important in our lives, but why\ncannot we develop the courage that it takes to qualify for the Spirit of God through exercising\nthe priesthood that has been given to us to the very fullest of our ability? Why cannot we?\nThat is the great and important problem, it seems to me, brethren and sisters.\n<\/p><p>\nI testify to you that priesthood is virile in the lives of men, that it is actual, that it has been\nrestored.  Bless your soul, in one direction, there are only two steps between my ordination as\nan elder and the Prophet Joseph Smith. It is here, brethren and sisters, in its vigor and in its\nstrength and in its purity in unbroken line. Now why cannot we live worthy of it and magnify\nit?\n<\/p><p>\nMay God help us to do it, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
