Moyle, <i>Conference Report<\/i> April 1957,  pp. 31-34<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI am deeply appreciative, my brethren and sisters, of this opportunity, and especially to have\nfelt the wonderful spirit that has been with us in these meetings. I am sure it has come to us\nin large measure as a result of the inspired opening remarks of our beloved President. I hope\nthat that same inspiration may continue with me for the next few moments.\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a passage in the scripture that has impressed itself upon me recently very much. It\nwas Job who said:\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them\nunderstanding (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"26677\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26677)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26677)\">Job 32:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nBorn of this inspiration is the testimony we have of the divinity of the Savior of mankind. We\nknow and bear witness to the world that he is the only Begotten Son of the Father, the\nRedeemer of mankind, the Lord God Almighty.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith tells us that the Holy Ghost is the medium through which\ninspiration is transmitted to us from on high and that the reception of the Holy Ghost is the\ndistinguishing characteristic of Latter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nPaul made clear to the Corinthians the true relationship between the Holy Ghost and our\npersonal testimony of the divinity of the Savior. He said:\n<\/p><p>\nBut the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.<br \/>\nFor to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to\nanother the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;<br \/>\nTo another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same\nSpirit;<br \/>\nTo another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of\nspirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"290\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 290)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(290)\">1 Cor. 12:7-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nPaul enumerates many gifts of the Spirit. The greatest gift, however, is not the performing of\nmiracles or talking in tongues, or prophesying, etc.; but the inception of an individual\ntestimony is the greatest of all gifts of the Spirit. And that is a gift which comes from God\nthrough the Holy Ghost and can be received by any man, woman, or child in the world who\ndesires to know the truth. It is at once the greatest and certainly the most universal of all gifts\nborn of the Spirit. It is indeed the Comforter promised to all who, through faith in God and\nrepentance, seek with a contrite heart a remission of sins in the waters of baptism.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is received by all who thus qualify through the laying on of hands by those in authority as\nprovided by the eternal laws of God.\n<\/p><p>\nAs surely as God sent his Son to redeem the sins of the world, so he sends the Holy Ghost to\nthose who seek divine guidance in understanding the gospel.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is the Holy Ghost, a member of the Godhead, a Personage of spirit, who inspires the souls\nof men with an understanding of God's will.\n<\/p><p>\nNow this inspiration comes through our lives of worthiness. Our testimony is the foundation\nupon which we progress. The inspiration of the Almighty, by and through which we received\nour witness, inspires us to bear testimony to others of our knowledge of God.\n<\/p><p>\nEvery true convert to the Church has felt the twofold power of his conversion and of this\ninspiration&mdash;first, to convert himself, and second, to assist in the conversion of others.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is our purpose as members of the Church to consider constantly the place of testimony in\nour lives. We dare not become complacent or unaware of this priceless gift which is ours.\nWhen we bear our testimony we are teaching others the truths that have enriched our lives\nand made us happy. Our testimonies are borne&mdash;First, to give thanks to God for the\nknowledge and assurance he has given us; second, to assist our brethren and sisters in the\nstrengthening of their testimonies; and third, to carry the conviction which is ours into the\nhearts of all other people upon the face of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nWe may sometimes find satisfaction in sharing our material wealth with others. But far\ngreater satisfaction comes from sharing ourselves, our time, our energy, our affection, and\nparticularly in imparting to others our testimony of God, the power of God unto salvation, the\nknowledge we possess of God and his purposes. When we are truly converted, we realize that\n\"this is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou has sent\"\n(see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"27739\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27739)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27739)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>),\nand to sense our responsibility to others to assist them in attaining eternal life.\n<\/p><p>\nChrist said to his disciples just prior to his ascension:\n<\/p><p>\nBut ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye\nshall be witnesses unto me . . .

(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7805\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7805)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7805)\">Acts 22:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWe must then constantly qualify ourselves as witnesses of spiritual matters. One of President\nMcKay's favorite poems illustrates the thought I have in mind:\n<\/p><p>\nThe builder who first bridged Niagara's gorge<br \/>\nBefore he swung his cable, shore to shore,<br \/>\nSent out, across the gulf, his venturing kite<br \/>\nBearing slender cord for unseen hands<br \/>\nTo grasp upon the further cliff, and draw<br \/>\nA greater cord, and a greater yet;<br \/>\nTill at last across the chasm swung<br \/>\nThe cable&mdash;then a mighty bridge in air!<br \/>\nSo we may send our little timid thought<br \/>\nAcross the void, out to God's reaching hands,<br \/>\nSend our love and faith to thread the deep&mdash;<br \/>\nThought after thought, until the little cord<br \/>\nHas greatened to a chain no chance to break,<br \/>\nAnd we are anchored to the Infinite.\n<\/p><p>\n             &mdash;Edwin Markham\n<\/p><p>\nThe Spirit then will reveal all things to us essential to our mission. We must be prepared to\nrecognize and accept that which the Spirit offers, that which the Spirit\nwould make clear to our understandings. Then knowledge flows freely to us from heaven.\n<\/p><p>\nWe know that through obedience to the principles of the gospel, all who believe on the name\nof Jesus Christ and endure in faith to the end, shall be saved in the celestial kingdom in the\npresence of the Father.\n<\/p><p>\nWe find in the life and works of Joseph Smith how the Spirit can magnify us for our callings\nif we but attune our lives thereto.\n<\/p><p>\nI never expect to live long enough to see a more wonderful example of that inspiration than\nwe witnessed here this morning when President McKay spoke under the inspiration of his\nhigh calling.\n<\/p><p>\nThrough the witness of the Spirit I know that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, raised up\nto fulfil the promises made of old, to bring to mankind the opportunity to become heir to all\nof the blessings the Lord has promised his children through the entire time of their sojourn\nhere in mortality upon the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now after 120 years of terrific scrutiny, the works and testimony of the Prophet Joseph\nSmith stand unimpeached. No one can imagine a severer cross-examination than that to which\nhe was subjected all through his life. By any standard, legal or otherwise, he was an almost\nperfect witness. Above all, he sealed his testimony with his blood.\n<\/p><p>\nWe who through the inspiration of the Almighty have received his testimony, and that of his\nfaithful brother Hyrum, are charged with responsibility to accept and to perpetuate and add\nour solemn witness thereto, that the blood of this generation shall not be upon us.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd as many as repent and are baptized in my name, which is Jesus Christ, and\nendure to the end, the same shall be saved.<br \/>\nBehold, Jesus Christ is the name given by the Father, and there is none other name\ngiven whereby man can be saved;<br \/>\nWherefore, all men must take upon them the name which is given of the Father,\nfor in that name shall they be called at the last day;<br \/>\nWherefore, if they know not the name by which they are called, they cannot have\nplace in the kingdom of my Father.<br \/>\nAnd now, behold, there are others who are called to declare my gospel, both unto\nGentile and unto Jew;<br \/>\nYea, even twelve; and the Twelve shall be my disciples, and they shall take upon\nthem my name; and the Twelve are they who shall desire to take upon them my\nname with full purpose of heart.<br \/>\nAnd if they desire to take upon them my name with full purpose of heart, they are\ncalled to go into all the world to preach my gospel unto every creature.<br \/>\nAnd they are they who are ordained of me to baptize in my name, according to\nthat which is written (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13544\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13544)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13544)\">D&amp;C 18:22-29<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat we do constantly bear witness to the hope we have within us is further proof of the\ndivine nature of the work in which we are engaged. Were it otherwise we could not be called\nthe true Church of Jesus Christ. Where else in all the world are the true fruits of the\ninspiration of the Almighty to be found, inspiration that giveth the souls of men\nunderstanding. Throughout the history of the Church innumerable examples of spiritual\nguidance are found. One which I have cherished since childhood is an early experience of\nWilford Woodruff.\n<\/p><p>\nWhile traveling in New England, on assignment by Brigham Young, President Woodruff\ndrove his carriage into the yard of Brother Williams. Brother Orson Hyde drove a wagon by\nthe side of his carriage. President Woodruff's wife and children were in that carriage. He had\nonly been there a few minutes when the Spirit said to him, \"Get up and move that carriage.\"\nWhen he told his wife that he had to move the carriage, she asked, \"What for?\" He answered,\n\"I don't know.\"\n<\/p><p>\nThat was all she asked on such occasions. When he told her that he did not know, that was\nenough. President Woodruff got up and moved his carriage four or five rods, and put the off\nfore wheel against the corner of the house. He then returned to bed. The same Spirit said, \"Go\nand move your animals from that oak tree.\" They were two hundred yards from his carriage.\nHe moved his horses and put them in a little hickory grove. Again he went to\nbed. In thirty minutes a whirlwind came up and broke that oak tree off within two feet\nof the ground. It swept over three or four fences and fell square in that dooryard, near Brother\nOrson Hyde's wagon, and right where the carriage had stood. What would have been the\nconsequences if he had not listened to that Spirit? Why, President Woodruff, his wife, and\nchildren doubtless would have been killed.\n<\/p><p>\nThat was the still, small voice to him&mdash;no thunder, no lightning, but the still, small voice of\nthe Spirit of God (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1202\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1202)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1202)\">1 Kgs. 19:12<\/a><\/span>).\nIt saved his life. It was the Spirit of revelation.\n<\/p><p>\nWe can all afford to develop a sensitiveness to the promptings of the Spirit in all things\npertaining to our physical as well as our spiritual well-being.\n<\/p><p>\nIn speaking on this subject, Joseph Fielding Smith has said, \"The testimony of the Holy Ghost\nis Spirit speaking to spirit, and is not confined solely to the natural or physical sense.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI bear witness to you, my beloved brethren and sisters, that there is the testimony of the\nSpirit. I know by the manifestation of the Spirit that Jesus is the Christ, the Risen Lord, the\nMaster of us all, whose sins he took upon himself. I know that through his redeeming\nsacrifice immortality and eternal life is ours, through our obedience to the great plan of life\nand salvation of which he was the Author.\n<\/p><p>\nMay we all become in our own right, saviors upon Mount Zion, instruments in the hands of\nthe Lord in helping to establish his Church and kingdom here upon the earth, continually\nbearing our witness in his behalf, that the world may know that God has once again spoken\nfrom the heavens to give us direction and purpose in our lives. We as his duly ordained\nservants come to open the door to all who seek righteousness.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has said:\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . this is my work and my glory&mdash;to bring  to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"39091\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 39091)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(39091)\">Moses 1:39<\/a><\/span>)&mdash;a\nresult which cannot be accomplished without understanding from on high, an\nunderstanding which the Almighty alone can inspire.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to accomplish the high purposes he has for us in life, I pray humbly, in the name\nof the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
