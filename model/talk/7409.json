A family was going through a difficult time. It was hard for them not to focus on their challenges. The mother wrote: \u201cOur world had completely crumpled, so we turned to Heavenly Father for guidance. Almost immediately we realized that we were surrounded by goodness and were being cheered on from every side. We began as a family to express our gratitude to each other as well as to the Lord daily. A close friend pointed out to me that our family\u2019s \u2018blessing basket\u2019 was overflowing. From that conversation came a sort of game, which my children and I grew to love. Before family prayer each night we would talk about how our day had gone and then share with each other all of the many blessings that had been added to our \u2018blessing basket.\u2019 The more we expressed gratitude, the more there was to be grateful for.

This grateful awareness heightens our sensitivity to divine direction. When we communicate gratitude, we can be filled with the Spirit and connected to those around us and the Lord.
