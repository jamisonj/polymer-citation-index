Theodore Tuttle<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the First Council of the Seventy<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">A. Theodore Tuttle, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1964, pp. 7-10<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nI want to testify, my brothers and sisters and friends, that he to whom we have just listened is\nindeed a prophet of the Living God, and if we can follow and comprehend this inspired\nmessage it will bring a solution to the evils that beset us in this day and age.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Greetings from 40,000 Members<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nTwo years ago from this pulpit I brought you greetings from 20,000 members of The Church\nof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South America. Today, because of the bounteous\nblessings of the Lord and the dedicated efforts of missionaries and members alike, I am\nprivileged to bring you greetings from more than 40,000 members of the Church. Thirty-three\nyears were required to convert the first 10,000 members in South America. Only two more\nyears were required to convert the next 10,000. Since I reported two years ago, 21,000 more\nconverts have found the truth in the seven missions of South America.\n<\/p><p>\nIn an atmosphere unfriendly to the biblical doctrines of continued revelation, a Church\nfounded on prophets and Apostles, belief in a Personal Father in heaven and Jesus Christ as\nthe actual and divine Son of God, how can a Church that teaches these biblical doctrines grow\nso rapidly? What is it that brings people into the restored gospel in such unprecedented\nnumbers in these South American countries?\n<\/p><p>\nReturn with me to this great land to get some feeling of the people among whom the Spirit of\nthe Lord is working.\n<\/p><p>\nWe find ourselves on a plane flying between Porto Alegre, Brazil, and Buenos Aires,\nArgentina. Seated next to me is an executive of a large international corporation. Upon\nlearning that I was a representative of the Mormon Church, he asked, \"What would a man like\nme have to do to join the Mormon Church?\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Conversions in South America<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSince he was smoking as he drank his cocktail, I commenced by suggesting that he would\nfirst have to give up both of these habits and abstain from the use of tea and coffee as well. I\nstarted to mention such other necessary requirements as faith, repentance, and baptism, when\nhe interrupted by saying, \"Under those restrictions, can you get anybody down here to join\nyour church?\" \"Yes,\" I replied. \"Thousands of people join the Church in these lands, in fact, in\nUruguay the ratio of conversion to population is as great as any place in the world. In fact I\nknow a member who has helped to bring ninety-three other persons into the\nChurch since she joined a year ago. But you made a mistake by calling it my church. It is not\nmy church, nor is it any man's church. In reality it is the actual Church of Jesus Christ and\nthe only one on the earth of which he is the head. When you come to know that, my friend,\nand you can gain that certain knowledge, then, changing your life to conform to the revealed\nword of the Lord is not as difficult as at first it might seem.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe then asked, \"If your church is growing so fast, what do you do with all the people?\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"The Church is a perfect organization,\" I explained, \"founded upon prophets and apostles\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21763\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21763)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21763)\">Eph. 2:20<\/a><\/span>), and\nit expands in an orderly way under pressure of numbers.\n<\/p><p>\n\"It does not require a professionally trained nor paid ministry to administer it. Ordinary\npeople like yourself are called, instructed, and empowered to conduct the affairs of the\nChurch, as in ancient times; for instance, I am an educator, our mission president in Buenos\nAires is an automobile salesman by occupation, and our president in Brazil is a contractor.\nMen are ordained to the priesthood of God. They are endowed with the power of the Holy\nGhost and led by personal revelation. A living prophet guides the Church today. It is the\npractice of the leaders in the Church to call people to work in a position suitable to their\ntalents and capacities. Here in South America, for instance, we use new members in one of\nthe organizations shortly after their baptism. Work in the Church is both a means to an end,\nas well as an end in itself. People are called to fill positions in order to grow and develop\npersonally, as well as to make the organization function more effectively to bless others. This\npersonal growth is the great benefit one receives through service.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI further explained to my friend that because of the increasing numbers in the Church in\nSouth America, we have in operation an extensive training program, the express purpose of\nwhich is to give specific training to every person newly called to a position in the Church.\nThis is to make certain that each new officer knows his duty. It is our goal to fill every\nposition in the church organization. This gives members opportunity to develop through an\non-the-job training program. This training touches every facet of one's personality. He\nbecomes not only more effective as a church official, but a better, more capable citizen as\nwell.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore, with a steady stream of people joining the Church,\" I continued, \"the\norganizations can expand in an orderly fashion. Leadership training can benefit and bless\nmore and more of your fellow countrymen. I even have the temerity to suggest that this kind\nof people&mdash;people who have been trained to think, who have had experience in solving\nproblems, who have accepted and discharged leadership responsibility&mdash;are the people you\nought to be seeking to staff your corporation.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Promises Being Fulfilled<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI bore testimony to this man that the Lord is now hastening the fulfillment of his promises\nand prophecies concerning this choice land and its people. They are receptive to the message\nthat God lives and that he directs, through revelation, his perfectly organized Church.\n<\/p><p>\nOur next stop is at El Cuzco, the ancient capital city of the Incan empire, situated at 11,000\nfeet in the tops of the Andes Mountains. We are in a press conference, and a reporter asks,\n\"What is the difference between The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other\nchurches?\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Authority by Direct Revelation<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWe quote from a living prophet to explain one of the major distinguishing features of the\nChurch. President David O. McKay has said, \". . . we believe in divine authority by direct\nrevelation rather than by descent.\" The power and authority came to this Church through the\nvisitation of angelic messengers: Peter, James, and John, the Apostles of old who as\nresurrected beings, conferred their authority and power upon Joseph Smith and Oliver\nCowdery in this dispensation. We explained that this doctrine is both scriptural and logical,\nfor the Bible itself is a compilation of revelations. They were given at different periods of\ntime through various prophets over approximately 4,000 years. Just as each\nprophet in times past left scripture as evidence of the divinity of his calling, so we offer to the\nhonest in heart today additional scriptures, both ancient and modern. These additional\nrevelations form the scriptural basis for the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints.\n<\/p><p>\nNext, stand with me in Chile at the doorway to a school, recently opened by the Church.\nBright-eyed youngsters march past into a new and marvelous world of learning that they have\nnever known before, of books and methods that are the newest and finest. We see a skilled\nand experienced teacher willing to go at her own expense to teach these eager children and to\nlead them to a testimony that the glory of God is intelligence\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14462\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14462)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14462)\">D&amp;C 93:36<\/a><\/span>)\nand that truth will make them free (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28118\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28118)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28118)\">John 8:32<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJourney next to a city nestled in the center of the Brazilian coffee plantations (an industry,\nincidentally, that we have been accused of trying to put out of business in Brazil). We are\nhere to attend a district conference. A fine-looking man, not a member of the Church two\nyears ago is speaking: \"The first time I entered the chapel I could actually feel a good spirit\nhere&mdash;a spirit of warmth and friendliness, one of concern and love for one another, and of\nbrotherhood. I also felt that I must clean up my life in order to associate with you people.\nYou made me feel welcome and needed.\"\n<\/p><p>\nLike all those who visit our meetings, he was welcome and is needed. He is particularly\nneeded today because he now presides as the president of the branch he once visited. He holds\nthe authority and has the power to share with all men the same spirit that so influenced and\nblessed his life.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Brotherly Kindness<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThe feelings of fraternity in this Church and the functions of its priesthood quorums bind men\ntogether in a bond of brotherhood. It brings warmth of companionship that delights the soul\nand makes life worthwhile. Love of fellow men penetrates from heart to heart across national\nborders. It becomes the only effectual process that erases men's artificial boundaries and\nunites them in a cause greater than their own political nationalism.\n<\/p><p>\nFinally accompany me as we become junior companions to some of the missionaries over\nwhom I preside. Recently, down in Argentina, my companion and I, at the invitation of a\nmember, went to visit his friend. Evidently we entered the wrong apartment building because\nthe man who responded to our knock was not the person whom we sought. My young\ncompanion, typical of today's energetic and dedicated youth, promptly introduced us as\nrepresentatives \"<i>de la Iglesia de Jesucristo de los Santos de los Ultimas Dias<\/i>\" and asked the\nman if he would like to know something about the Church. Our new-found friend said, \"Yes,\"\nbut after a short conversation when my companion offered to leave him a tract, he refused to\ntake it saying, \"My church forbids me to read anything of a religious nature like this.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Search for Truth Brings Freedom<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHow grateful I am, my friends, that the enlightened search for truth by this Church frees a\nman from fear and teaches him that life is to learn, that truth is to be sought and accepted\nfrom any source&mdash;scientific or revealed. It teaches that God is our Father and teacher, that\nwe are son and pupil, and that we can actually become like him, this by learning and keeping\nhis commandments and doing his revealed will. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints teaches that man's pursuit of truth is his eternal quest: \n<\/p><p>\n\"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom\nthou hast sent\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28140\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28140)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28140)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now as we return from South America, I speak to all who can hear. Perhaps for the first\ntime you have heard the glad message that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored.\nPerhaps you have had friends or neighbors who have recently joined The Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints. You have probably wondered why their lives changed so much;\nwhy they seemed to be happier and busier, why they seemed to live more purposefully.\nShould you, too, not seek information about this marvelous and sacred\nmessage?\n<\/p><p>\n\"Prove all things,\" Paul admonished, \"hold fast that which is good\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2739\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2739)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2739)\">1 Thes. 5:21<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nYou, father and husband, as head of your household, should you not find release from the sins\nof the world that beset you, through faith, sincere repentance, and baptism by immersion for\nthe remission of sins? Should you not find the strength to complete the change in your life,\nfor the strength will come through receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost? Should you not\npossess the priesthood and experience its power? Should you not have the joy of certain\nknowledge that Jesus is the Christ, that God lives? The Lord will not withhold this blessing\nfrom any who sincerely seek it.\n<\/p><p>\nLook at that sweet companion by your side. Should your wife not find an outlet for sharing\nher heaven-endowed gifts in unison with other good women? Would you deny her the\ninfluences which strengthen her as a wife and mother?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd your most priceless possessions, what of them? I see that teenager at your side. Should\nyour teenager not have the opportunity to participate in a youth organization where youth\nmutually improve one another?\n<\/p><p>\nAnd your little ones, what of them? How pliable, how susceptible to all the influences of life?\nShould they not have the protection and the advantage of training in child-centered\norganizations which teach them: \"I am a child of God. My Heavenly Father loves me.\"\n<\/p><p>\nShould your entire family not kneel night and morning and receive the additional strength that\ncomes through a Wise and Loving Father? Should you and all members of your family not\nseek and find the supreme joy and the abundant life that the Savior taught in his Church\nrestored again?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Search for Better Life<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhile men have been blinded by men and prejudiced by tradition in the lands of South\nAmerica, nevertheless, when they hear explained the doctrines of this Church, when they\nunderstand its teachings, and when they see its programs in action, they are not antagonistic to\nits message. Rather, they respond to the opportunity to hold the priesthood, to give service\nfreely, to exercise the power of leadership, to do something and be somebody, because the\npromises of the Lord and the prophecies of his servants concerning these lands and this\npeople are now being fulfilled.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear my witness that this Church is indeed the restored Church of Jesus Christ, that he is at\nits head directing it today by direct and authoritative revelation to his living prophet, President\nDavid O. McKay. I know there is a great awakening among the people of South America and\na yearning for a better life&mdash;not only a desire for the material blessings but a deep searching\nand longing for the spiritual heritage which they have been promised, to which they are\nentitled. The Lord has set his hand to bless this choice land and this people of promise and\ndestiny. I invite all men everywhere to seek within this gospel the supreme joy that comes\nfrom the certainty of this testimony, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
