Richards, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1962, pp. 48-50<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brothers and sisters, I have enjoyed the spirit of this conference as you have&mdash;the\nbeautiful music that has been rendered and the wonderful counsel that has been given us by\nour Prophet and the other leaders that have spoken to us.\n<\/p><p>\nTruly, \"The Spirit of God like a fire is burning,\" and the \"veil o'er the earth is beginning to\nburst.\" (William W. Phelps.)\n<\/p><p>\nThis is so noticeable as we travel throughout the missions. Since the first of the year Sister\nRichards and I have visited all of the eight eastern American missions from Canada to\nFlorida. We have met with more than 1,700 missionaries and thousands of Saints. I would\nlike to report that their spirit is wonderful, and they are very happy and dedicated. The \"Every\nMember a Missionary\" program is being used more and more, and convert baptisms are\ndouble those of a year ago.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay, in the film, \"Every Member a Missionary,\" stated that the purpose of the\ngospel of Jesus Christ is to change men's lives, to change human nature. Does this mean \"to\nbe born again\"? Brothers and sisters, I am certain it does. The Savior, in speaking to\nNicodemus, said, \". . . Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27998\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27998)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27998)\">John 3:3<\/a><\/span>).\nNicodemus replied: \"How can a man be born when he is old? . . .\"\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior then answered, \". . . Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of\nwater and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God . . . Marvel not that I said\nunto thee, Ye must be born again\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28000\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28000)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28000)\">John 3:3-7<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nInvariably missionaries testify that their greatest joy and happiness comes from seeing men\nand women born again as they are baptized. Yes, in seeing the change that comes into their\nlives as they accept and live the simple gospel truths. Missionaries are truly seeing miracles\noccur in the lives of the converts they baptize as they accept the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the eight eastern American missions, convert baptisms in 1960 were 4,527; in 1961,\n10,209, and for the first three months of this year are more than double a year ago. Recently I\nreceived a letter from the members and missionaries of the Elkins (West Virginia) Branch\nwhich indicates what is happening. Let me quote a part of it.\n<\/p><p>\n\"We as missionaries and members of the Elkins Branch are so thrilled with the success and\ngrowth of our branch that we want to write and tell you about it. We have been blessed with\nthis growth since you came a year ago and told us of the 'Every Member a Missionary' plan.\nIn the five years from 1955 through 1960 there were 42 converts baptized in the Elkins\nBranch. With the 'Every Member a Missionary' program we, as a team in the Elkins Branch,\nbegan to ask people the Golden Questions, and those that wanted to know about the Church\nwe invited into our homes for group meetings. Because of this the Lord blessed our branch\nmembership with 121 convert baptisms in 1961, which nearly doubled our branch\nmembership.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Yes, 121 convert baptisms in 1961 compared with 42 in the five years before. In the first\ntwo months of 1962 the Lord has blessed us with 51 convert baptisms, which is almost half\nof the total number of baptisms in 1961.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The branch president and his family have been having group meetings in their home\nregularly for all age groups. By their screening the people through asking the Golden\nQuestions before they invite them into their home, the missionaries have baptized about 20\npeople from this one family's meetings alone. The effect it has had is tremendous. The people\nare really baptismal conscious and are doing everything they can to have group meetings.\n<\/p><p>\n\"We testify to you that asking the Golden Questions and having group meetings is a very\neffective way to bring souls into the Kingdom of God. The love, enthusiasm, and spirituality\nhas never been higher. We love to baptize people.\" Signed, The Elkins\nBranch members and missionaries.\n<\/p><p>\nAgain, in the Oakridge, (Tennessee), Branch there were twenty-three convert baptisms in\n1961, and in January and February of this year there were thirty&mdash;more in the first two\nmonths of this year than all of last year.\n<\/p><p>\nAt Louisville, Kentucky, the East Central States Mission office staff of five missionaries, by\nholding group meetings Sundays and evenings, baptized 124 wonderful converts in the year\n1961.\n<\/p><p>\nAt a recent stake conference in California, a great deal of interest and enthusiasm was shown\nin the \"Every Member a Missionary\" program. After the morning session a woman came up\nand introduced herself and presented her friend, saying, \"She is mine.\" Both of their faces\nreflected great joy and happiness. Then she explained that she had asked her friend the\nGolden Questions, and her friend replied that she was interested and would like to know more\nabout the Church. The woman then arranged for the missionaries to come to her home and\nteach her friend the beautiful truths of the gospel as contained in the six discussions. Her\nfriend prayed, studied, and attended Church to further her understanding. She soon gained a\ntestimony and was baptized.\n<\/p><p>\nNo wonder this good sister felt so much joy as she put her arm around her friend, and said,\n\"She is mine.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAre you one of those who are wondering about the spirit of the missionaries? I tell you as a\nwhole they have never been happier; they have never worked more effectively and have never\nbeen more richly rewarded. The great number of convert baptisms are their reward. Who does\nthe Lord's work gets the Lord's pay. Yes, they are reaping while the day lasts, that they may\ntreasure up for their souls everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14080\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14080)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14080)\">D&amp;C 6:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nRecently I received a letter from a sister in Athens, Tennessee. She had been searching for the\ntruth for forty-five years, and when she heard the gospel, she knew she had found what she\nwas looking for. The missionaries met her in October 1960, and she was baptized November\n23. When she was baptized, she was the only member in Athens. Within three months five of\nher family and friends had been baptized, having been influenced by her powerful testimony.\nNow a little more than a year later they have a branch of thirty, with a Sunday School, MIA,\nand Primary. This sister is quite typical of the many converts coming into the Church at this\ntime.\n<\/p><p>\nIncreased membership in the Church requires more and larger chapels for worship, for\nteaching, and for cultural purposes. Last year there were twenty beautiful chapels completed\nin the eight eastern American missions. This year there are forty-two new chapels either under\nconstruction or soon to start. Also in the east coast stakes many more new chapels or\nadditions to present chapels are being started. Adequate places to hold church services are\nreally wonderful missionary aids.\n<\/p><p>\nOf particular interest is the site recently purchased in New York City, just off Fifth Avenue\nbetween 57th and 58th streets. The proposed construction of a church facility at this site\nreceived nationwide publicity and opened many doors and minds to the missionaries. Also,\nwith the increased membership on the east coast more districts are becoming ready for stake\norganizations. Three stakes have been organized within the last few months, and twelve more\nareas are presently under consideration. There are now fifteen stakes in the area of the eight\neastern American missions.\n<\/p><p>\nI was especially pleased to be selected to accompany Elder Delbert L. Stapley to organize the\nCumorah Stake at Palmyra, New York, the birthplace of the Church. I tell you the Spirit of\nthe Lord and that of the Prophet Joseph was truly there.\n<\/p><p>\nYes, my brothers and sisters, the Spirit of the Lord is being poured out upon all flesh, and\nmen's hearts are being softened. One branch president in the east asked me, \"How long is this\nmissionary explosion going on in the Church?\" The answer is found in the sixty-fifth section\nof the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 2.\n<\/p><p>\n\"The keys of the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth. and from thence\nshall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the\nmountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14146\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14146)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14146)\">D&amp;C 65:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis prophecy cannot be fulfilled by the full-time missionaries and the part-time missionaries\nalone. It is necessary for \"Every member to be a missionary,\" as our Prophet has declared.\n<\/p><p>\nLet me again remind you how <i>you<\/i> can be a missionary. First, by living the gospel so that\nothers seeing your good works may be led to join the Church; by asking your friends and\nneighbors what they know about the Church, and if they would like to know more. Many will\nsay yes. Then, invite them into your homes, and have the missionaries, stake or full-time, give\nthem the simple gospel discussions.\n<\/p><p>\nTake your friends who want to know more about the Church to our Church meetings, and\nlove them into the Church. When the people who want to know more about the Church do\nnot live near you, send their names, addresses, and telephone numbers to the nearest stake or\nmission where they live.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the beautiful hymn, \"Praise to the Man,\" we sing: \"Wake up the world for the conflict of\njustice. Millions shall know 'Brother Joseph' again.\" (William W. Phelps.) I love the Prophet\nJoseph Smith, and I am certain that as this great missionary work goes forward, millions will\nknow Brother Joseph again.\n<\/p><p>\nBrothers and sisters, I know that our Father in heaven lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Only\nBegotten of the Father in the flesh. I bear witness that Joseph Smith is one of the great\nprophets of all time; and that we have a great prophet at the head of the Church at this time.\n<\/p><p>\nDavid O. McKay is one of the greatest missionaries that has ever lived, and I sustain, love,\nand support him. May the Lord bless us that we may, each and every one of us, be\nmissionaries, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
