And when the books shall be opened and the lineage of all men is known, it will be found that they have been first and foremost in everything noble among men in the various nations in breaking off the shackles of kingcraft and priestcraft and oppression of every kind, and the foremost among men in upholding and maintaining the principles of liberty and freedom upon this continent and establishing a representative government, and thus preparing the way for the coming forth of the fullness of the everlasting Gospel. And it is the foremost of those spirits whom the Lord has prepared to receive the Gospel when it was presented to them, and who did not wait for the Elders to hunt them from the hills and corners of the earth, but they were hunting for the Elders, impelled by a spirit which then they could not understand; and for this reason were they among the first Elders of the Church; they and the fathers having been watched over from the days that God promised those blessings upon Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and Ephraim. And these are they that will be found in the front ranks of all that is noble and good in their day and time, and who will be found among those whose efforts are directed in establishing upon the earth those heaven-born principles which tend directly to bles<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"187a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD23\/JoD23_0187.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;187a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/1340\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>sing and salvation, to ameliorating the condition of their fellow men, and elevating them in the scale of their being; and among those also who receive the fullness of the Everlasting Gospel, and the keys of Priesthood in the last days, through whom God determined to gather up again unto himself a peculiar people, a holy nation,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"77848\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 77848)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(77848)\">1 Pet. 2:9<\/a><\/span> a pure seed that shall stand upon Mount Zion as saviors, not only to the house of Israel but also to the house of Esau.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"62036\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 62036)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(62036)\">Obad. 1:21<\/a><\/span> <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v23n623\"> Now the work of carrying the Gospel to the nations and gathering the people, mighty as it is, is not the chief, it is but laying the foundation for the still greater work of the redemption of the myriads of the dead of the seed of Israel that have perished without the fullness of the Gospel, who too are heirs to the promised blessings; but the time had not come when they passed away for the fulfillment of all that God had promised Abraham, Isaac and Jacob concerning their seed: Ezekiel in the 37th chapter of his book beautifully illustrates this doctrine in his vision of the valley of dry bones.
