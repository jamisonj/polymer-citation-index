If things were as they should be, we would see a mother and father in a home having been married in the temple for time and eternity. The father honoring his priesthood, presiding in his home in righteousness. Father and mother loving each other and their children. Children loving and respecting each other and mother and father. All actively engaged in their church responsibilities. The Lord intended that marriage performed for eternity in the temple should endure forever. This was his plan. President Joseph Fielding Smith has said: \u201cMarriage, as understood by Latter-day Saints, is a covenant ordained to be everlasting. <span class=\"emphasis\">It is the foundation for eternal exaltation, for without it there could be no eternal progress in the kingdom of God.<\/span>\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Doctrines of Salvation <\/span>[Bookcraft, 1967], vol. 2, p. 58.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cWhat therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33243\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33243)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33243)\">Mark 10:9<\/a><\/span>.) It is evident from the scriptures that marriage performed in the Lord\u2019s way should not be dissolved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p11\" class=\"\">It is sad, indeed, to see how lightly some take their marriage vows.

I suppose this is the same reason divorce was finally permitted in the time of Moses, as referred to by the Savior as he answered the Pharisees, when he said: \u201cMoses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36091\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36091)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36091)\">Matt. 19:8<\/a><\/span>.) And so in our day members do not abide by the law of the gospel in its fullness, and, as in the day of Moses, divorce is permitted, when deemed necessary, although it was never intended to be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p14\" class=\"\">If, in marriage, both parties would make gospel standards and principles the basis of their marriage, few problems would arise they could not handle. When one or the other or both begin to compromise gospel standards, problems follow. Marriage is a sacred relationship, and good members of the Church would know that it is entered into primarily for the rearing of a family. Other important desires and plans in marriage should be well understood by both parties as well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p15\" class=\"\">President McKay said, in reference to the seriousness with which we enter the marriage contract: \u201c\u2026 to look upon marriage as a mere contract that may be entered into at pleasure in response to a romantic whim, or for selfish purposes, and severed at the first difficulty or misunderstanding that may arise, is an evil meriting severe condemnation, especially in cases wherein children are made to suffer because of such separation.\u201d (Quoted in Blaine R. Porter, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Latter-day Saint Family <\/span>[Deseret Book Co., 1966], pp. 402\u2013403.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p16\" class=\"\">Possibly to list some of the most common causes for which civil divorces are sought might be helpful in avoiding these problems: incompatibility, adultery, money matters, physical abuse, dishonesty, not living the gospel, infidelity, not honoring priesthood, desertion, constant bickering, apathy, drunkenness, uncontrolled temper.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p17\" class=\"\">Incompatibility has come to be such a common word, it seems to be the justification for many problems. I\u2019m sure there are occasions where this is justified, but what is incompatibility? Doesn\u2019t this indicate selfishness? Are we truly unselfish, do we love our neighbor as ourself when we are not compatible? Have we made every effort to compromise our likes and dislikes with those of our spouse? If we were truly living the gospel, there would be much less incompatibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p18\" class=\"\">President McKay said of incompatibility, \u201cFor a couple who have basked in the sunshine of each other\u2019s love to stand by daily and see the clouds of misunderstanding and discord obscure the lovelight of their lives is tragedy indeed. In the darkness that follows, the love sparkle in each other\u2019s eyes is obscured. To restore it, fruitless attempts are made to say the right word and to do the right thing; but the word and act are misinterpreted, and angry retort reopens the wound, and hearts once united become torn wider and wider asunder. When this heartbreaking state is reached, a separation is sought.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Ideals <\/span>[Improvement Era, 1953], p. 469.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p19\" class=\"\">I have been shocked in learning the extent to which men are physically abusive to women. In the October conference of 1951 President McKay said, \u201cI cannot imagine a man\u2019s being cruel to a woman. I cannot imagine her so conducting herself as to merit such treatment. Perhaps there are women in the world who exasperate their husbands, but no man is justified in resorting to physical force or in exploding his feelings in profanity. There are men, undoubtedly, in the world who are thus beastly, but no man who holds the priesthood of God should so debase himself.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Ideals, <\/span>p. 476.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p20\" class=\"\">The matter of disinterest, lack of voluntary expression, lack of affection are common causes for breakdown of marriage. President Harold B. Lee recently said this to a group of priesthood leaders: \u201cI say to you brethren the most dangerous thing that can happen between you and your wife or between me and my wife is apathy, \u2026 for them to feel that we are not interested in their affairs, that we are not expressing our love and showing our affection in countless ways. Women to be happy have to be loved and so do men.\u201d (Seminar for Regional Representatives of the Twelve, December 12, 1970, p. 6.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p21\" class=\"\">To take lightly the law of chastity or to violate the moral teachings of the Savior is a sober matter. It seems incredible that priesthood holders and women who have been considered worthy to hold a recommend to the temple and be married therein are so often guilty of adultery, infidelity, and other sex sins.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p22\" class=\"\">In this day when so many women are working out of the home, as men and women work together, many homes are broken up by what at first starts to be an innocent association.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p23\" class=\"\">President McKay gave some sober direction to the men when he said, \u201cA man who has entered into a sacred covenant in the house of the Lord to remain true to the marriage vow is a traitor to the covenant if he separates himself from his wife and family just because he has permitted himself to become infatuated with the pretty face and comely form of some young girl who flattered him with a smile. Even though a loose interpretation of the law of the land would grant such a man a bill of divorcement, I think he is unworthy of a recommend to have his second marriage performed in the temple.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel Ideals, <\/span>p. 473.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p24\" class=\"\">No matter what the reason for divorce, those usually hurt most are the children.

(<span class=\"emphasis\">The LDS Family, <\/span>p. 406.) The possibility of any of these is lessened in divorce.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p26\" class=\"\">As Sister Cullimore and I went to the temple to be married, President George H. Brimhall [of Brigham Young University] called us into his office. He gave us some direction we have appreciated through the years. He said: \u201cThe four fountains that will keep your \u2018Garden of Eden\u2019 from becoming a desert are constant confidence, constant counsel, constant compromise, constant courtship.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p27\" class=\"\">Important to any marriage is complete confidence\u2014trust in all things.

As we acknowledge our own faults and recognize the virtues in the other and make the adjustments, we strengthen our marriage.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p31\" class=\"\">Henry Watterson has said: \u201cI would compromise war. I would compromise glory. I would compromise everything at that point where hate comes in, where misery comes in, where love ceases to be love, and life begins its descent into the valley of the shadow of death. But I would not compromise Truth. I would not compromise the right.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p32\" class=\"\"><span class=\"emphasis\">Constant courtship. <\/span>President McKay has said: \u201cThe seeds of a happy married life are sown in youth. Happiness does not begin at the altar: it begins during the period of youth and courtship.\u201d (Pathways to Happiness [Bookcraft, 1957], p. 49.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p33\" class=\"\">Neither should courtship end at the altar. How important it is to constantly be conscious of our marriage and work at it every day we live, keeping alive our courtship by kind acts, thoughtfulness, and consideration always. Archibald F. Bennett, in his writings on family exaltation, expresses this beautifully: \u201cToo many couples have come to the altar of marriage looking upon the marriage ceremony as the end of courtship instead of the beginning of an eternal courtship. Let us not forget that during the burdens of home life \u2026 that tender words of appreciation, courteous acts are even more appreciated than during those sweet days and months of courtship. It is after the ceremony and during the trials that daily arise in the home, that a word of \u2018thank you,\u2019 or \u2018pardon me,\u2019 \u2018if you please,\u2019 \u2026 will contribute to that love which brought you to the altar. \u2026 The wedding ring gives no man the right to be cruel or inconsiderate, and no woman the right to be slovenly, cross or disagreeable.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">The LDS Family, <\/span>p. 236.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/marriage-is-intended-to-be-forever.p34\" class=\"\">May we keep sacred our marriage vows and live so that we might enjoy its eternal blessings, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
