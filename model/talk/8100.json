Each summer, our family took long trips to visit the most significant monuments, historic sites, and natural wonders of Europe. Finally, after spending 22 years in the Paris area, we were getting ready to move. I still remember the day when my children came to me and said, \u201cDad, it\u2019s absolutely shameful!

Suddenly the signs of His birth appeared in the heavens. The people were so stricken with astonishment that they humbled themselves, and nearly all were converted. However, only a short four years later, \u201cthe people began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, \u2026 and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-12455_000_037\">3<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130745\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130745)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130745)\">3\u00a0Nephi 2:1<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/is-it-still-wonderful-to-you.p16\" class=\"\" id=\"p16\">My brothers and sisters, is the gospel still wonderful to you? Can you yet see, hear, feel, and marvel? Or have your spiritual sensors gone into standby mode?

The writer Marcel Proust said, \u201cThe real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-12455_000_037\">4<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cMarcel Proust,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Guardian,<\/span> July 22, 2008, theguardian.com\/books\/2008\/jun\/11\/marcelproust.]<\/span><\/sup> Do you remember the first time you read a verse of scripture and felt as if the Lord was speaking to you personally? Can you recall the first time you felt the sweet influence of the Holy Ghost come over you, perhaps before you even realized it was the Holy Ghost? Weren\u2019t these sacred, special moments?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/is-it-still-wonderful-to-you.p18\" class=\"\" id=\"p18\">We should hunger and thirst every day after spiritual knowledge. This personal practice is founded on study, meditation, and prayer. Sometimes we might be tempted to think, \u201cI don\u2019t need to study the scriptures today; I\u2019ve read them all before\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t need to go to church today; there\u2019s nothing new there.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/is-it-still-wonderful-to-you.p19\" class=\"\" id=\"p19\">But the gospel is a fountain of knowledge that never runs dry. There is always something new to learn and feel each Sunday, in every meeting, and in every verse of scripture. In faith we hold to the promise that if we \u201cseek, \u2026 [we] shall find.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-12455_000_037\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"130746\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 130746)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(130746)\">Matthew 7:7<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/is-it-still-wonderful-to-you.p20\" class=\"\" id=\"p20\">Second, anchor your faith in the plain and simple truths of the gospel.

They came from an isolated village far away in the bush where the Church had not yet been organized but where there were 15 faithful members and almost 20 investigators. For over two weeks these men had walked on foot, traveling more than 300 miles (480 km) over paths rendered muddy by the rainy season, so they could attend the conference and bring the tithes from the members of their group. They planned to stay for an entire week so they could enjoy the privilege of partaking of the sacrament the following Sunday and then hoped to set out on the return trip carrying boxes filled with copies of the Book of Mormon on their heads to give to the people of their village.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/is-it-still-wonderful-to-you.p22\" class=\"\" id=\"p22\">The missionary testified how touched she was by the sense of wonder these brethren displayed and by their wholehearted sacrifices to obtain things that for her had always been readily available.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/05\/sunday-morning-session\/is-it-still-wonderful-to-you.p23\" class=\"\" id=\"p23\">She wondered: \u201cIf I got up one Sunday morning in Arizona and found that my car wasn\u2019t working, would I walk to my church only a few blocks away from home?
