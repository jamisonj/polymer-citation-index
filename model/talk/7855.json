In the early years of the Christian era, Rome martyred thousands for their faith in Jesus Christ.

Christians killed by other Christians are the most tragic martyrs of the Christian faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/sacrifice.p15\" class=\"\">Many Christians have voluntarily given sacrifices motivated by faith in Christ and the desire to serve Him. Some have chosen to devote their entire adult lives to the service of the Master. This noble group includes those in the religious orders of the Catholic Church and those who have given lifelong service as Christian missionaries in various Protestant faiths.

As a result, the lay members who are called to lead and serve our congregations must carry the whole load of our numerous Church meetings, programs, and activities. They do this in more than 14,000 congregations just in the United States and Canada. Of course, we are not unique in having lay members of our congregations serve as teachers and lay leaders. But the amount of time donated by our members to train and minister to one another is uniquely large. Our efforts to have each family in our congregations visited by home teachers each month and to have each adult woman visited by Relief Society visiting teachers each month are examples of this. We know of no comparable service in any organization in the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/sacrifice.p22\" class=\"\">The best-known examples of unique LDS service and sacrifice are the work of our missionaries. Currently they number more than 50,000 young men and young women and over 5,000 adult men and women. They devote from six months to two years of their lives to teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ and providing humanitarian service in more than 160 countries in the world. Their work always involves sacrifice, including the years they give to the work of the Lord and also the sacrifices made in providing funds for their support.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2012\/05\/sacrifice.p23\" class=\"\">Those who remain at home\u2014parents and other family members\u2014also sacrifice by forgoing the companionship and service of the missionaries they send forth.

A General Authority described these children\u2019s meeting in council and remembering that their deceased parents had taught them that they should always be prepared to serve the Lord. The young man accepted his missionary call, and a 16-year-old brother took over the responsibility of working to support the family.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-10405_000_009\">6<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See Harold\u00a0G.
