Brown<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcspkpos\">Of the Presiding Bishopric<\/p>\n<p class=\"gcbib\">Victor L. Brown, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1967, pp. 19-20<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nPresident David O. McKay has said: \"The home is truly the first unit of society, and\nparenthood is next to Godhood. The relationship of the children to the parents should be one\nwhich would enable those children to carry out ideal citizenship as they become related to the\nstate and to the larger forms of society. The secret of good membership in the Church or good\ncitizenship in the nation lies in the home.  If and when the time ever comes that parents shift\nto the state the responsibility of rearing their children, the stability of the nation will be\nundermined, and its impairment and disintegration will have begun . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"Would you have a strong and virile nation?&mdash;then keep your homes pure. Would you reduce\ndelinquency and crime?&mdash;lessen the number of broken homes. It is time that civilized people\nrealize that the home largely determines whether children shall be of high or low character.\nHome-building, therefore, should be the paramount purpose of parents and of the nation.\"\n(<i>The Improvement Era<\/i>, April 1963, pp. 252-53.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Troubled parents&mdash;troubled children<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs I travel about the Church and discuss various problems of youth, I invariably get the\nresponse: \"If we did not have trouble with the parents, we would not have trouble with the\nchildren.\"\n<\/p><p>\nA national Explorer leader emphasized this point when be said, \"One of our greatest problems\nis to know how to teach boys to be honest when their parents are dishonest.\"\n<\/p><p>\nToday I should like to direct my remarks to parents.\n<\/p><p>\nIf I understand the teachings of the Church, one of the greatest of all responsibilities we have\nas members is that of parenthood.  We hear this statement repeated frequently: \"The family is\nthe most important unit in time and in eternity.\" This I accept as truth.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Through the eyes of youth<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere probably is not a parent in the Church but who would be offended if accused of not\nloving his or her children, and yet, when looking at parent-child relationships through the eyes\nof a teenager, many questions arise.\n<\/p><p>\nTake, for instance, the young man who had almost reached the state of incorrigibility when he\ncame to a counselor for help.  He was drinking excessively; he was a chain smoker; he was\ncontinually in trouble with the law; and yet he came from a good LDS home. I'm sure his\nparents loved him and would have done anything in the world to help him, but let us see what\nthe counselor discovered.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen asked if he liked the taste of liquor, the boy replied that he hated it.  When asked if he\nenjoyed smoking, he said he detested the taste of tobacco.  When asked why he was\nconstantly in trouble with the law, he answered that he really didn't want to do many of the\nthings he did.\n<\/p><p>\nThe counselor delved deeper and found that the boy's bedroom was in the basement, directly\nunder the living room.  When his father walked across the room, the boy could hear his\nfootsteps overhead, the sound of which made him acutely nauseated.\n<\/p><p>\nFurther interviews revealed that the boy loved his father but felt that he was a total failure in\nhis father's eyes. You see, he simply could not satisfy him, no matter how hard he tried. His\nfather was a perfectionist, and no matter what the son did, the father pointed out how he\ncould have done better. Never did he compliment him. The result: a boy lost in a confused,\nfrustrating, and difficult world with no one to help him.\n<\/p><p>\nHis father was a good man, active in the Church.  I am sure he loved his son, but did he\nreally?  Was his love unselfish? Was it the kind of love that gave nourishment and\nencouragement to those less able than he, or was it the kind that demanded perfection to\nsatisfy himself?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Analyze relationships with children<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nParents, I believe it behooves us to analyze closely our relationship with each of our children\nto see if our actions reflect true love.  Do we want to teach and train our children to take their\nproper places in society and become better parents than we are?  If so, we must be aware of\nour shortcomings and overcome them.  You see, this father had had the same kind of strict,\noverbearing father himself. Like father, like son.  Surely, we must encourage our children to\ndevelop their talents and to achieve to the greatest extent of their ability.  I hope, however,\nour motive is for their own development, growth, and happiness and not to satisfy our\npersonal pride.\n<\/p><p>\nA few months ago I had a most revealing interview with a lovely young college student.  This\nyoung lady was the youngest in her family. All her brothers and sisters had married and left\nhome.  Her father was a farmer.  She had worked on the farm each summer plowing and\ndoing other farm work generally done by boys and men. This she did not mind, but now she\nwas 19.  She said she loved her parents with all her heart and would never do anything to\nhurt them. She said, \"Bishop Brown, my folks expect me to come back home this summer\nand help on the farm, but I have simply got to find out if I am really Susie Jones or just\nBrother Jones' little girl, as I have always been. I have got to find out if I am a real person, if\nI can stand on my own feet and make decisions, or be totally dependent upon my parents.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHere was a lovely young lady loved by her parents&mdash;there is no doubt about that because of\nthe respect and love she had for them&mdash;but in the process of growing up, it would appear\nthat decisions she should have been making for herself were made by her parents.  Had their\nlove smothered their daughter?  Were they preparing her for the day when she would, of\nnecessity, have to make decisions on her own?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Give children training and experience in decision-making<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere are some parents who feel their children just are not capable of making decisions.  How\ncan children ever develop this capacity if, as they grow up, they are not taught and given wise\nguidance?\n<\/p><p>\nOf course, good sense must be used in determining how far to go in letting a child make his\nown decisions.  Recently, I visited with a young woman who is having marital difficulty with\nher third husband.  This young lady has a mother who is still making her decisions for her.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>In taking responsibility<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nParents, may I suggest that we analyze our relationships with our children.  Are we teaching\nthem in such a way as to prepare them for the responsibilities of life, or are we protecting\nthem to the point that when they find themselves on their own, they are lost?\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to quote a few excerpts from a discussion Dr. Dana L. Farnsworth had with\nLester David regarding parent-child relationships: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Your prime goal as a parent is to help your child grow up with the good inner feeling that he\nor she is a perfectly capable, worthwhile human being, able to stand on his or her own feet.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHere are some of the rules he gives toward accomplishing this objective: \n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Give emotional support\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFirst: <i>\"Give them emotional support when they need it most&mdash;right at the start of their life.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\n\"A baby comes into the world utterly dependent upon other human beings. If the help he\nneeds is forthcoming promptly and consistently, accompanied by love, he learns very early\none of the most important lessons of his entire life&mdash;that he can rely upon people.  The baby\nwhose first basic needs are met begins to develop a positive, confident outlook essential for\nlater emotional health.  Chances are that through life, he will have the feeling that things are\ngoing to work out well for him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"If parents are not warmly responsive to an infant, he is apt to develop a suspicion and a\nmistrust of people. He may later withdraw from them, refusing to be their friend, in order to\nprotect himself from hurt. Such a person cannot become a warm and loving wife or husband.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Of course, when I suggest parents respond to their infants' needs, I certainly do not mean\nthat babies must be hovered over and entertained every minute.  Strike a happy medium.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Early start to independence\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSecond:  \"<i>Start them early on the road to independence.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\n\"Once I watched a very small child trying to button his coat.  His mother,\nsuddenly aware he was having difficulties, quickly said: 'Here, let Mommy fix it.' And she\ndid.  But she also did nothing to help her son feel capable . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"You can help [a child achieve] balance by permitting him to try his own wings, while at the\nsame time protecting him from real dangers. Let him stand, walk, climb, do as much as\npossible for himself, and praise him for his accomplishments.  Have you seen the smile of\ntriumph that lights up a toddler's face when he's done something all by himself&mdash;fixed a toy,\ncarried a package or even just stood up? He glows inside, too, with a wonderful feeling of 'I\ncan.'\n<\/p><p>\n\"As he grows, the child becomes more and more concerned with doing useful things.  The\nthings he achieves himself become crucially important to him.  He gains confidence by trying\nand succeeding. So let him try out his basic knowledge and skills.  Let your son try to climb\nthat fence, build a tree house, manage his affairs.  Let your daughter arrange her own social\nactivities, even plan her own party.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Be sure, of course, that you do not expect too much of your child, criticize him with undue\nharshness, or permit activities that are unsafe at his age.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"To make up their minds\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThird: \"<i>Teach children to make up their minds.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\n\"A twelve-year-old boy came home from school one day and told his mother he wanted to\nrun for class president, but wasn't quite sure.  That evening at dinner, while the boy sat\nquietly, his parents debated whether he ought to make the race, discussing the pros and cons\nand, finally, deciding that he should not because his schedule for the next year would be too\nheavy.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Too many parents do all or most of the problem-solving for their children. As a result, the\nchild never learns how to make up his mind about things, crucial for good mental health.\nEvery human being must make decisions all through life, and those who never learn how are\nseriously handicapped.\n<\/p><p>\n\"A child can be taught to make decisions by allowing him to do so as often as possible and to\nprofit by his mistakes.  In all of his day-to-day problems, let him understand you have faith in\nhis ability to unravel them. Listen to and discuss the facts with him.  Suggest approaches and\ngive the child the benefit of your wisdom and experience.  But avoid taking over his\nindependent right to decide upon the clothes he should wear, school problems and the like.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Common sense should dictate the kind of problems best left to a child's judgment.  Those\nwith potentially serious consequences, of course, must still be decided by Mother and Father.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Foster understanding<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFourth: \"<i>Keep the lines of understanding open<\/i> . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . [Realize] that each of your children is an individual, with his own abilities, personalities\nand needs. Don't expect one to match another's accomplishments; rather, help him take pride\nand pleasure in what he does well.\n<\/p><p>\n\"[Be] courteous to your child, listening when he speaks, respecting his rights and feelings.\n<\/p><p>\n\"[Present] logical arguments for your decisions.  'Because I say so' is a poor reply when a\nchild asks why he is required to do something.  Giving sensible reasons makes you a fair and\nreasonable person in your child's eyes. He may not acquiesce gracefully, but inwardly, in\nmost cases, he will probably see your point.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Commendation for doing well<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFifth: \"<i>Commend them for what they do well instead of condemning them for what they don't.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\n\". . . A 21 year-old college co-ed, under treatment for a severe neurosis, told her therapist: 'If\nI came home from kindergarten with two stars, Mother wanted to know how come I didn't\nget three like the day before.  If I got four marks over 90, she wondered how come the fifth\nwas only 80.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Psychiatrists know that many persons with personality problems report they too seldom\nreceived praise at home for their accomplishments.  Rather, their areas of\nweakness were constantly being pointed out.  Over and over, they say, 'I grew up feeling I\ncouldn't do anything right' . . .\n<\/p><p>\n\"Many parents feel guilty when their children do not turn out as well as they think they\nshould. This is not justified unless they really haven't tried to train their children or haven't\nloved and respected them.  Even then it is of no help unless it motivates efforts to try to learn\nhow to develop better relations with them.  Being a parent is not easy and mistakes are\nalways made: they will not be too harmful if love and respect prevail.\" (<i>This Week<\/i>, June\n19, 1966.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Sacred responsibility to children<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI pray that we as parents will accept the sacred nature of our responsibility to our children and\nthat we will endeavor to apply love in a wise and intelligent manner, and, of course, to do\nthis, the first requirement is that there is love and harmony between mother and father.  Our\nhomes must be a bulwark against the confusion and trials of the world.  If this generation is\nto fulfill its destiny, it must be strong in the most important of all places and that is the home,\nfor in Proverbs we read, \"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he\nwill not depart from it\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41481\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41481)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41481)\">Prov. 22:6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI leave you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that God lives, that this is his Church, and\nI do so in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
