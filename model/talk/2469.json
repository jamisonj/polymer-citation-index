After all, it is essentially a religious institution. It has its origin in [a] religious ceremony. It is the fulfillment of [a] divine command. Its government is of a religious nature and the finest of its products are spiritual.\u201d (Stephen L Richards, <span class=\"emphasis\">Where Is Wisdom?<\/span> Deseret Book Co., 1955, p. 193.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-family-a-divine-blessing.p6\" class=\"\">The Lord has said that in the ordinances of the Melchizedek Priesthood \u201cthe power of godliness is manifest.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16342\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16342)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16342)\">D&amp;C 84:20<\/a><\/span>.) Thus, clothed with the holy priesthood of God and commissioned by the Lord, a man takes his place at the head of his family. Through his righteous leadership, the power of godliness may be manifest in his home. This sacred obligation and stewardship he shares with his wife, his helpmate.

His lovely daughter was being pursued by an ardent admirer\u2014one who had unfortunately turned away from the Church and who, through his wrongdoings, had been cut off from the blessings of the priesthood and Church membership. This girl thought she loved him and believed she might be happy with him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-family-a-divine-blessing.p12\" class=\"\">Her concerned parents invited the young man into their home and tried to convince him of the need to put his life in order and to follow Christ. The father bore a fervent testimony of the reality of the Savior and of the joy that comes through obedience to his gospel. However, his words were rejected by the young man. In fact, the boy scoffed at such ideas and afterward tried to convince the girl that her father was old-fashioned and a hypocrite.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-family-a-divine-blessing.p13\" class=\"\">This accusation, the father said, was the young man\u2019s undoing.

As we celebrate the Easter season, we reverence the most significant demonstration of brotherly love ever shown. The atoning sacrifice of Christ was the supreme example of unselfish love. While Jesus was our only brother who could make such a sacrifice for us, each of us can and should make Christlike sacrifices daily for one another through unselfish actions and willing service. It is in the home that we experience many opportunities to do this.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-family-a-divine-blessing.p36\" class=\"\">One day my older brother, Lynn, came hurrying home from high school basketball practice, bringing a teammate with him. Upon entering the house, both made a dash for the kitchen to satisfy their hungry appetites. My brother\u2019s friend loudly described his feeling of hunger by using a few vulgar and profane words to accent his anxious mood. Lynn quickly, quietly, but firmly said, \u201cHey, don\u2019t talk like that. My little brothers might hear you. I don\u2019t want them to learn words like that. Besides, they might think less of you than they ought to.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-family-a-divine-blessing.p37\" class=\"\">Unknown to my brother, my friend and I did hear that conversation, but the profane words were quickly erased from my mind by the thoughtful concern and courage shown by my older brother. That experience made a positive, lasting impression on my young mind. At the risk of sacrificing a friendship, his kindly chastisement of his friend taught me a lesson of love and concern for others and of courage to uphold the right.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-family-a-divine-blessing.p38\" class=\"\">So important are our relationships with our family members as we learn these lessons of life that family home evening has been revealed by the Lord as a prescribed means for the enduring development of all family members.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-family-a-divine-blessing.p39\" class=\"\">Each Monday evening families will gather together, with father presiding, to experience one of the highlights of the week\u2019s activities. During this special time together, the family, regardless of size or circumstances, may receive instruction and inspiration. Here in the sacredness of home father and mother teach correct gospel principles to their children. The children also have opportunities to teach and to share their thoughts and talents. Often the most effective learning takes place as family members help each other prepare for family home evening. Parents and children increase in their love and appreciation for one another as they participate in family home evening and strive to apply the principles learned there throughout the following weeks and years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-family-a-divine-blessing.p40\" class=\"\">President Kimball, whom we have sustained as president and prophet today and of whom I testify is a living prophet of the Lord Jesus Christ, has indicated that heaven was in his home when home evening was held. He has also said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/the-family-a-divine-blessing.p41\" class=\"\">\u201cWhile one objective is reached by merely being together, yet the additional and greater value can come from the lessons of life. The father will teach the children. Here they can learn integrity, honor, dependability, sacrifice, and faith in God. Life\u2019s experiences and the scriptures are the basis of the teaching, and this, wrapped up in filial and parental love, makes an impact nothing else can make. Thus, reservoirs of righteousness are filled to carry children through the dark days of temptation and desire, of drought and skepticism. As they grow up, the children cooperate in building this storage for themselves and the family. And so we have as a basic part of the Lord\u2019s programs the home evening and the family prayers and the teaching of gospel principles in our homes.\u201d (Spencer W.
