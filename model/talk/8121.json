I soon learned the history and meaning of the nautical phrase \u201cshipshape and Bristol fashion.\u201d At one time Bristol was the second busiest port in the United Kingdom. It had a very high tidal range of 43 feet (13 m), the second highest in the world. At low tide when the water receded, the old ships would hit bottom and fall on their sides, and if the ships were not well built, they would be damaged. In addition, everything that was not carefully stowed away or tied down would be thrown in a chaotic fashion and ruined or spoiled.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-12461_000_016\">5<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[See Wiktionary, \u201cshipshape and Bristol fashion,\u201d wiktionary.org.]<\/span><\/sup> After I understood what that phrase meant, it was clear that this leader was telling us that, as missionaries, we must be righteous, follow rules, and be prepared for difficult situations.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2015\/11\/saturday-morning-session\/shipshape-and-bristol-fashion-be-temple-worthy-in-good-times-and-bad-times.p10\" class=\"\" id=\"p10\">This same challenge is applicable to each of us.

But this we know: they will come! In order to overcome the challenges and temptations that each of us inevitably faces, it will require righteous preparation and the use of divinely provided protections.

Clearly, our Lord Jesus Christ emphasized, as a foundational doctrinal message, both righteous attitudes and conduct in day-to-day living.

It may feel beyond our reach as struggling disciples. From our limited perspective, current temptations and distractions can seem attractive. The rewards for resisting those temptations, on the other hand, can feel distant and unattainable. But a true understanding of the Father\u2019s plan reveals that the rewards of righteousness are available right now. Wickedness, such as immoral conduct, is never part of the answer.
