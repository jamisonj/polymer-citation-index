I testify to you that Joseph Smith is a prophet, and because I have received this answer from the Lord, I know that all of his successors are prophets too. What a great blessing it is to have prophets in our day!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/obedience-to-the-prophets.p8\" class=\"\">Why is it important to have living prophets to guide the true Church of Jesus Christ and its members?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/obedience-to-the-prophets.p9\" class=\"\">In the Guide to the Scriptures, we find the definition of the word <span class=\"emphasis\">prophet:<\/span> \u201cA person who has been called by and speaks for God. As a messenger of God, a prophet receives commandments, prophecies, and revelations from God\u201d (\u201cProphet,\u201d scriptures.lds.org; see also Bible Dictionary, <span class=\"scriptureRef\">\u201cProphet\u201d<\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/obedience-to-the-prophets.p10\" class=\"\">It is a great blessing to receive the word, commandments, and guidance of the Lord in these difficult days of the earth. The prophet can be inspired to see the future in benefit of mankind.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/obedience-to-the-prophets.p11\" class=\"\">We are told that \u201csurely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120596\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120596)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120596)\">Amos 3:7<\/a><\/span>). We learn from this scripture that the Lord will reveal to His prophets absolutely anything that He feels is necessary to communicate to us. He will reveal His will to us, and He will instruct us through His prophets.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/obedience-to-the-prophets.p12\" class=\"\">The Lord promised us that if we believe in the holy prophets, we should have eternal life (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"120597\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120597)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120597)\">D&amp;C 20:26<\/a><\/span>). In the sixth article of faith, we declare that we believe in prophets.

His great talk, titled \u201cFourteen Fundamentals in Following the Prophet,\u201d touched my heart. It made me feel good that I had made the decision to follow the prophets for the rest of my life when I accepted baptism in the Lord\u2019s true Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/obedience-to-the-prophets.p14\" class=\"\">I would like to share with you some of the principles that President Benson taught:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/obedience-to-the-prophets.p15\" class=\"\">\u201cFirst: <span class=\"emphasis\">The prophet is the only man who speaks for the Lord in everything<\/span>\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">1980 Devotional Speeches of the Year<\/span> [1981], 26).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/obedience-to-the-prophets.p16\" class=\"\">In our day the prophet of God has told us to keep the commandments, to love our fellowman, to serve, to take care of the rising generation, to rescue the inactive or less active\u2014to do many things that we call prophetic priorities. We need to understand that these priorities are God\u2019s priorities and the prophet is His voice in communicating them to all of the Church and the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/obedience-to-the-prophets.p17\" class=\"\">We are counseled to \u201cgive heed unto all his words and commandments\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"120598\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 120598)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(120598)\">D&amp;C 21:4<\/a><\/span>).

I can remember many times when I have been present to hear one of the servants of the Lord speak about a specific thing for a city or country. I remember at least three of the living prophets, seers, and revelators who have spoken about my country, Brazil. One of these servants said that Brazil would become a great economy in the world and be free of inflation. At the time, we had two-digit inflation every month. It was difficult for many people to believe what the prophet said, but I believed. Brazil has had about 5 percent inflation each year for many consecutive years now. Brazil has become eighth in the world economy, and the country is doing great!<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/obedience-to-the-prophets.p22\" class=\"\">Third fundamental: <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cThe living prophet is more important to us than a dead prophet\u201d<\/span> (\u201cFourteen Fundamentals,\u201d 27).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2010\/11\/obedience-to-the-prophets.p23\" class=\"\">We learn a great lesson about this from the scriptures.
