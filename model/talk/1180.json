McKay, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1962, pp. 5-9<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nOne hundred and thirty-two years ago today a group of men and women, in obedience to a\ncommandment of God, were assembled in the house of Mr. Peter Whitmer, Sen., for the\npurpose of organizing the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was just a group of friendly neighbors, unknown to anyone beyond the countryside in\nwhich they followed their daily vocations. A good picture of the moral and economic\natmosphere of the neighborhood may be surmised from the following introduction of one of\nthe citizens: Joseph Knight, Sen. \"'owned a farm, a grist mill and carding machine. He was\nnot rich, yet he possessed enough of this world's goods to secure to himself and family, not\nonly the necessaries, but also the comforts of life . . .' He 'was . . . a sober, honest man,\ngenerally respected and beloved by his neighbors and acquaintances. He did not belong to any\nreligious sect, but was a believer in the Universalian doctrine.' The business in which Joseph\nKnight, Sen., engaged, made it necessary at times for him to hire men, and the Prophet Joseph\nwas occasionally employed by him. To the Knight family . . . the young Prophet related\nmany of the things God had revealed respecting the Book of Mormon, then as yet, to come\nforth.\" (<i>DHC<\/i> 1:47.)\n<\/p><p>\nOf such ordinary, rural men and women was the group composed who assembled in Peter\nWhitmer's house in Fayette, Seneca County, New York, a century and thirty-two years ago\ntoday.\n<\/p><p>\nMeans of communication were primitive&mdash;seven years before the telegraph would be known.\nThe only light in the house after dark would be furnished by candle, perhaps by kerosene\nlamp. The electric light globe would not be known for forty years. Sixty years&mdash;almost a\nlifetime&mdash;before the automobile would be used! And the airplane existed only in the realm of\nimagination. Yet one year before the organization of the Church, under the inspiration of the\nLord, Joseph Smith had written: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14074\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14074)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14074)\">D&amp;C 4:1<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThere is no evidence that such a statement had ever before been made by an obscure lad, and\nif it had, it would have passed into obscurity with the boastful pretensions or\nimaginations of its author. Just as the anticipated, foolish aspirations of \"Darius Green and his\nflying machine,\"&mdash;I am not sure whether I am right on that, but that is as I remember it as a\nboy&mdash;who spoke disdainfully of the man who had made \"wings of wax\" that would not stand\n\"sunshine and hard whacks,\" and who boastfully said: \"I shall make mine of leather, or\nsomething or other.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI mention that merely to emphasize the fact that a Church to become a \"marvelous work and a\nwonder\" must contain those elements of truth which find lodgment in the human mind, which\nin honesty recognizes and loves truth wherever or whenever it is found.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is true that over a century ago, when men heard that a young man claimed that God had\nrevealed himself, they mocked him, and in doubt turned away from him just as in the\nbeginning of the Christian Era wise and able men in Athens turned away from a lonely little\nbrown-eyed man who challenged much of their philosophy as false and their worship of\nimages as gross error, yet the fact remained that he was the only man in that great city of\nintellectuals who knew by actual experience that a man may pass through the portals of death\nand live&mdash;the only man in Athens who could clearly sense the difference between the\nformality of idolatry and the heartfelt worship of the only true and living God. By the\nEpicureans and Stoics with whom he had conversed and argued, Paul had been called a\n\"babbler,\" a \"setter-forth of strange gods\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7900\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7900)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7900)\">Acts 17:18<\/a><\/span>);\n<\/p><p>\n\"And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new\ndoctrine, whereof thou speakest is?\n<\/p><p>\n\"For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these\nthings mean\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7901\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7901)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7901)\">Acts 17:19-20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n\"Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' Hill, and said, Ye men of Athens I perceive that in all\nthings ye are too superstitious.\n<\/p><p>\n\"For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO\nTHE UNKNOWN GOD, Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7902\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7902)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7902)\">Acts 17:22-23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nToday, as then, too many men and women have other gods to which they give more thought\nthan to the resurrected Lord&mdash;the god of pleasure, the god of wealth, the god of indulgence,\nthe god of political power, the god of popularity, the god of race superiority&mdash;as varied and\nnumerous as were the gods in ancient Athens and Rome.\n<\/p><p>\nThoughts that most frequently occupy the mind determine a man's course of action. It is\ntherefore a blessing to the world that there are occasions such as this, which, as warning\nsemaphores, say to mankind: <i>In your mad rush for pleasure, wealth, and fame, pause and<\/i>\n<i>think what is of most value in life.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nWhat fundamental truths, what eternal principles, if any, were associated with that little group\nwhich assembled one hundred and thirty-two years ago?\n<\/p><p>\n<i>The first<\/i> was <i>Man's Relationship to Deity.<\/i>\nFor the first time in eighteen hundred years, God had revealed himself as a Personal\nBeing. The relationship of Father and Son had been established by the divine introduction:\n\"This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30423\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30423)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30423)\">JS&mdash;H 1:17<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThose who were baptized into the Church that day in April 1830 <i>believed in the existence of<\/i>\n<i>a Personal God; that his reality and that of his Son Jesus Christ constitute the eternal<\/i>\n<i>foundation upon which this Church is built.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nCommenting upon this eternally existent, creative power of God, Dr. Charles A. Dinsmore of\nYale University, in <i>Christianity and Modern Thought<\/i>, aptly says: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Religion, standing on the known experience of the race, makes one bold and glorious\naffirmation. She asserts that this power that makes for truth, for beauty, and for goodness is\nnot less personal than we. This leap of faith is justified because <i>God cannot be less than the<\/i>\n<i>greatest of his works<\/i>, the <i>Cause<\/i> must be adequate to the effect. When, therefore, we call God\npersonal, we have interpreted him by the loftiest symbol we have. He may be infinitely more.\nHe cannot be less. When we call God a Spirit, we use the clearest lens we have to look at the\nEverlasting. As Herbert Spencer has well said: '<i>The choice is not between a<\/i>\n<i>personal God and something lower, but between a personal God and something higher.<\/i>'\"\n<\/p><p>\n\"My Lord and my God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28043\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28043)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28043)\">John 20:28<\/a><\/span>)\nwas not merely a spontaneous, meaningless exclamation of Thomas\nwhen he beheld his Risen Lord. The Being before him was his God. Once we accept Christ as\ndivine, it is easy to visualize his Father as being just as personal as he; for Christ said, \". . .\nhe that hath seen me hath seen the Father\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28026\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28026)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28026)\">John 14:9<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nHow boastful, how unfounded, is the brazen declaration of communism that \"there is no\nGod,\" and that \"Religion (the church) is but an opiate!\"\n<\/p><p>\nFaith in the existence of an Intelligent Creator was the first element that contributed to the\nperpetuity of the Church, <i>the everlasting foundation upon which the Church is built.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\n<i>The second cornerstone is the Divine Sonship of Jesus Christ<\/i>. The gospel teaches that Christ\nis the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world. No true follower is satisfied to accept him\nmerely as a great teacher, a great reformer, or even as the One Perfect Man. The Man of\nGalilee is not figuratively, but <i>literally<\/i> the Son of the Living God.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>A third principle<\/i> which contributes to the stability of the Church and which impressed not\nonly that little group, but millions since, that a great and marvelous work was about to come\nforth, <i>is the immortality of the human soul.<\/i>\n<\/p><p>\nJesus passed through all the experiences of mortality just as you and I. He knew happiness.\nHe experienced pain. He rejoiced as well as sorrowed with others. He knew friendship. He\nexperienced also the sadness that comes through traitors and false accusers. He died a mortal\ndeath even as every other mortal. As his spirit lived after death, so shall yours and mine.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>A fourth element<\/i> which contributed to the perpetuity of that little group was the\n<i>Cherished Hope for the Brotherhood of Man<\/i>. One of the two great general principles to which all others\nare subsidiary is this: \". . . love thy neighbour as thyself\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35192\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35192)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35192)\">Matt. 19:19<\/a><\/span>), and correlated with it,\nthe promise: \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done\nit unto me\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35202\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35202)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35202)\">Matt. 25:40<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe gospel bids the strong bear the burdens of the weak, and to use the advantages given\nthem by their larger opportunities in the interest of the common good that the whole level of\nhumanity may be lifted, and the path of spiritual attainment opened to the weakest and most\nunlearned as well as to the strong and intelligent.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Savior condemned hypocrisy and praised sincerity of purpose. He taught that if the heart\nbe pure, actions will be in accord therewith. Social sins&mdash;lying, stealing, dishonest dealings,\nadultery, and the like&mdash;are first committed in thought.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Sow a thought, reap an act,<br \/>\n          Sow an act, reap a habit,<br \/>\n          Sow a habit, reap a character,<br \/>\n          Sow a character, reap an eternal destiny.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;                                      &mdash;E. D. Boardman\n<\/p><p>\nJesus taught that an unsullied character is the noblest aim in life. No man can sincerely\nresolve to apply to his daily life the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth without sensing a change\nin his own nature. The phrase, \"born again\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27997\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27997)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27997)\">John 3:3<\/a><\/span>)\nhas a deeper significance than many people\nattach to it. This <i>changed feeling<\/i> may be indescribable, <i>but it is real<\/i>. Happy the person who\nhas truly sensed the uplifting, transforming power that comes from this nearness to the Savior,\nthis kinship to the Living Christ.\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Resistance<\/i> is necessary along with obtaining a sense of the real divinity. There should be\ndeveloped also the <i>power of self-mastery<\/i>. Someone has said that when God makes the prophet,\nhe does not unmake the man. I believe that, though being \"born anew,\" and being entitled to\nnew life, new vigor, new blessings, yet the old weaknesses may still remain. The adversary\nstands by, ever eager and ready to attack and strike us at our weakest point.\n<\/p><p>\nTake, for example, the incident of Jesus on the Mount of Temptation. After he had passed\nthrough the ordinance of baptism to fulfil all righteousness, after he had received the\ncommendation of the Father and the testimony from on high that he is the Beloved Son in\nwhom the Father is well pleased, the tempter was there ready to thwart, if\npossible, his divine mission. At his weakest moment, as Satan thought, when his body was\nfamished by long fasting, the Evil One presented himself, saying, \". . . If thou be the Son of\nGod, command that these stones be made bread\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35148\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35148)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35148)\">Matt. 4:3<\/a><\/span>). Though his body was weak, his\nspirit was strong, as he answered: \". . . It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by\nevery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35150\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35150)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35150)\">Matt. 4:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWith unwavering strength, Jesus withstood the tempter's taunts and promises that followed,\nand triumphantly demanded, \". . . <i>Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship<\/i>\n<i>the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve<\/i>\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35152\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35152)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35152)\">Matt. 4:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo it is with each of us in our daily resisting of the tempter. He will make his appeal to what\nmay be our weakest point of resistance. His strongest strain will be on the weakest link in the\nchain that binds our character. It may come in the form of yielding to habit, tendency, or\npassion which we have indulged for years. It may be a desire for the old pipe or the cigarette\nwhich we determined, if we were sincere, to put aside when we entered the waters of baptism.\nAnd when that longing comes, after we are in the Church or kingdom, in that moment when\ntemptation comes, we may say to ourselves, \"Though I intend to throw it aside, I will take it\nonly once more&mdash;this once will not count.\" That is the moment of resistance when we should\nsay, as Christ, \"Get thee behind me\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"35184\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 35184)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(35184)\">Matt. 16:23<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThis power of self-control in regard to our bodily longings, satisfying the passions, applies to\nevery member of the Church of Christ. In some way, the Evil One will attack us; some way\nhe can weaken us. In some way, he will bring before us that which will weaken our souls and\nwill tend to thwart the true development of the spirit within, the strengthening and growth of\nthe spirit, which time cannot kill, which is as enduring as the Eternal Father of the spirit. And\nthe things which will tend to dwarf this spirit or to hinder its growth are things which\nmembers of the Church are called upon to resist.\n<\/p><p>\nOne hundred and thirty-two years ago the Church was officially organized with six members.\nIt was unknown, and, I repeat, would be known only to the extent that it contained and\nradiated those eternal principles which harmonize with the eternity of its Author, and only\nthus could it become a great and marvelous work.\n<\/p><p>\nToday there are branches of the Church in many parts of the world. As the effulgent light of\na glorious sun gladdens the surface of the earth by day, so the Light of Truth is entering into\nthe hearts of many honest men and women throughout the world.\n<\/p><p>\nThe marvelous progress that has been made in transportation and communication makes it\npossible for the promulgation of the truths of the restored gospel to be made known to the\nchildren of men everywhere on the face of the globe. It is possible for millions in America,\nEurope, Asia, Africa, and the islands of the sea not only to hear, but in many instances to see\nwhat you are doing as members for the gospel of truth.\n<\/p><p>\nTo all members, and to our Father's children everywhere, we declare in all sincerity that God\nlives! As sure as the light of the sun shines upon everything on the physical earth, so the\nradiance that emanates from the Creator brightens every soul that comes into the world of\nhumanity, for it is in him that we \"live and move and have our being\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7905\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7905)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7905)\">Acts 17:28<\/a><\/span>). All of us, therefore,\nshould make him the center of our lives.\n<\/p><p>\nJesus Christ his Beloved Son also lives and stands at the head of the kingdom of God on\nearth. Through him the eternal plan of the gospel has been given to man and restored in its\nfulness to the Prophet Joseph Smith. Through obedience to the principles of the gospel, we\nmay become partakers of his divine Spirit, as Peter of old, after two and a half years of\nassociation with the Redeemer, testified (see\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"4865\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4865)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4865)\">2 Pet. 1:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIn the words of President John Taylor: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Go, ye messengers of glory; <br \/>\n          Run, ye legates of the skies; <br \/>\n          Go and tell the pleasing story<br \/>\n          That a glorious angel flies; \n<\/p><p>\n\"Go, to all the gospel carry;<br \/>\n          Let the joyful news abound; <br \/>\n          Go till every nation hear you<br \/>\n          Jew and Gentile greet the sound.<br \/>\n          Let the gospel echo all the earth around.\"\n<\/p><p>\nI pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
