I met him in Milan approximately two years ago, a few months after he had joined the Church. He is a fine, wonderful, clean-cut young man, the kind any parent would be proud of. He was living a good life. He thought he had no needs that were not being met\u2014until he found the gospel of Jesus Christ. I should like to share from his letter a few thoughts having to do with his feelings about himself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/finding-ones-identity.p4\" class=\"\">\u201cWithout those two elders, my life could have been happy, full of satisfaction, but lacking all the benefits of love, faith, truth, knowledge, freedom, all the things coming only from God, our Heavenly Father, through his Son, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/finding-ones-identity.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cAs a child of God, I am glad to live at this time on the earth.

Our lives are greatly changed and our hearts are willing to do what our Father in Heaven wants us to accomplish.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/finding-ones-identity.p7\" class=\"\">This wonderful young man has now achieved an awareness of his own identity which so many people, young and old, are hungering for. Finding one\u2019s own, intimate identity can be a great blessing in the life of every human being. Everyone can obtain it if he realizes it comes only through the light of truth or, as explained by the Savior, the light of life. In <span class=\"citation\" id=\"29180\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 29180)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(29180)\">John 8:12<\/a><\/span> we read, \u201cI am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/finding-ones-identity.p8\" class=\"\">As we endeavor to understand what it means to have the light of life, which is a most important aid to discovering our identity, we must of necessity know who Jesus is. From the holy scriptures, we are told who he is\u2014the Son of God, referred to as the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. He was born of Mary. He is our Redeemer through whom repentance and forgiveness of sin are made possible. He it is who was condemned to die and even while hanging on the cross forgave his executioners. He is the same who rose from the tomb and by that act broke the bonds of death for all mankind, establishing the resurrection. This is the same Jesus who guides his church in these latter days, which church carries his name, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/finding-ones-identity.p9\" class=\"\">Through direct teachings during his mortal life and through instruction given to both ancient and modern prophets which are found recorded in the sacred scriptures, the Savior left all mankind sufficient teachings for each one to understand himself and to find his own, true identity. It comes only through knowledge of and obedience to the commandments. Once it does come, the thoughts, \u201cI\u2019m not worth anything\u2014I\u2019m just a nobody,\u201d will have no place in our lives. By \u201ctrue identity\u201d I mean the relationship between self-worth and self-subordination. The quest for this is explained in the words of George T. Boyd in a talk he gave some years ago.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/finding-ones-identity.p10\" class=\"\">\u201cScripture reading enables [man] to see life, not alone from the human point of view, but in some degree from God\u2019s.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/finding-ones-identity.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cThis perspective fills two of man\u2019s important needs\u2014a sense of individual worth and a feeling of self-subordination. Either of these are achievable alone. But how easy it is for a sense of personal worth to turn to an intolerable egoism and self-conceit\u2014or a sense of self-subordination\u2014to turn into a false humility or morbid self-depreciation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/finding-ones-identity.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cIn the scriptures man finds that he belongs to a whole, of which God is a part. Belonging to such a whole gives him a sense of the value of his own soul, but seen in relation to God reveals his dependence and hence his subordination. \u2026 Thus, a devout use of the scriptures nourishes the spiritual life with a calm that displaces the doubts and anxieties which paralyze mankind.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Views on Man and Religion,<\/span> ed.

He was asked a question and when he answered it correctly was informed he had won an expensive sports car. It seemed like a dream come true for a teenage boy. A loving bishop was concerned about what such a car might do to the boy, thinking it might draw him away from all we hold dear. He asked him about his feelings. The bishop could hardly believe his ears when the young man indicated he was not going to take the car but would accept a cash award instead. He said, \u201cNow my mission is paid for.\u201d What an outstanding example of proper balance in an attitude toward worldly wealth or recognition and Christlike values.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/finding-ones-identity.p41\" class=\"\">I am acquainted with another young man who struggled to achieve this balance. He had received tremendous recognition as an athlete. He started swimming competitively at age thirteen and would practice upwards of thirty hours every week. He became a national champion and winner of a bronze medal at the 1968 Olympic Games. He was an All-American in college for three years. After graduation he went on to medical school and did very well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/finding-ones-identity.p42\" class=\"\">During all this time, he had excluded himself from any spiritual association and had little warmth toward people less fortunate or less talented than he. He was struggling for a real feeling of self-worth. In his own words: \u201cI would tell myself, \u2018You are an Olympian. You have a good mind, you will become a doctor and have the good life.\u2019 I would tell myself this as I was contemplating suicide.

With the encouragement of his older mentor, he began to read the scriptures. At first he did so with arrogance, confident that intellectually he could understand all he read, which he found he could not do. Again in his own words: \u201cI was halfway through Genesis and was learning very little when I said to myself, \u2018There must be chapters that are written in a way that will be easier to understand.\u2019 I turned to Numbers and found that I understood even less.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1983\/05\/finding-ones-identity.p44\" class=\"\">Finally, he pursued his studies in the right spirit, wanting to learn and to feel.
