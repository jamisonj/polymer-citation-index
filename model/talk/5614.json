With only a few exceptions, a young person cannot find adequate role models among those in athletics, entertainment, or commercial music. Not only do these public figures fail to provide positive examples, but they are often the exact inverse of the type of role models that are acceptable to most of us. Access to these contemporary icons is expensive and unproductive. We are almost always disappointed when we come to witness the shallow and murky standards by which the public heaps its praise. No wonder the public areas of so many cities and towns are crowded with young people who are possessed with these same shallow and murky standards of personal behavior.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/search-for-identity.p8\" class=\"\">Yet there is an abundance of role models who can be found much closer and who can have much deeper influence upon each one of us. Most of us, with relatively little effort and much less cost, can provide for our families a veritable list of important role models. This list can be created from a modest search into the lives of our ancestors. Let me give you a few examples:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/search-for-identity.p9\" class=\"\">A few years ago, as a birthday gift, I went to the FamilySearch\u00ae system and retrieved my wife\u2019s entire recorded family pedigree. That was a serious mistake. The computer revealed that my wife is a descendant of European royalty. It has been hard to live with her ever since. Maybe now, through this knowledge of her family history, I am more inclined to treat her as our family queen. But the biggest problem, of course, is that my children share in this royal ancestry, which, sadly, makes me the only \u201ccommoner\u201d in my family.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/search-for-identity.p10\" class=\"\">Manasseh Byrd Kearl, born in 1870 and raised near Bear Lake in northern Utah, tells a wonderful story that might be instructional to his descendants, of which I am one. Let me read from his journal:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/search-for-identity.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cThat fall father bought some cattle for John Dikens, a very large herd. Dikens had a large ranch on Bear River. \u2026 I remember Jimmie was down north buying cattle and he sent father that he needed more money. So father toled me to take some money to him. Mother sewed six hundred dollars in my under clothes, and father put me on a horse and said, \u2018Now Byrdie my boy, don\u2019t you get off this horse till you find your brother Jimmie, and keep your mouth shut, and if any one asks you questions don\u2019t reply or tell them where you are going, and do not give this money to any one but Jimmie, no matter what any one tells you.\u2019 Well, when I got to DingleDell, I was toled Jimmie was in Montpelier. So to Montpelier I went to Joe Richs, a friend of father\u2019s, he toled me that Jimmie had gone home. Brother Rich wanted me to go in the house and get something to eat. I toled him no, that father toled me not to get off this horse till I found Jim, and here I stayed. I turned around and headed for home. When I got to Bears Valley, \u2026 I could hardly walk. Mr. Potter tried to get me to stop and rest, but I could not stay. At last I got home. Jimmie took me off the horse and carried me into the house. Mother cried to think I had been in the saddle while the horse went over eighty miles.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-95905_000_020\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Personal journal of Manasseh Byrd Kearl, copy in possession of author.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/search-for-identity.p12\" class=\"\">Let us consider also the eloquent language of Gustave Henriod:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/search-for-identity.p13\" class=\"\">\u201cYou, my kind reader, will never know the sports and vicissitudes, joys and fears, gladness and disappointment, grief and delight, cravings and satisfactions, hope and despair, anxiety and contentment, pains and pleasures, all of which are familiar associates, or rather were in the year 1853 between Omaha and Salt Lake City. Yoking up half wild oxen every morning, staking down the tent every night, picking up buffalo chips to cook the food, loading and unloading boxes and bedding mornings and evenings, in the saddle or on foot guarding the stock every night and driving loose cattle in the day, digging trenches around the tents to keep from being drowned by the torrents, singing the songs of Zion, mending a broken wagon, \u2026 washing your clothes\u2014everybody forgot a clothes line.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-95905_000_020\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[In <span class=\"emphasis\">Our Pioneer Heritage,<\/span> comp.

If the men had not been saints, there would doubtless have been much profane language used; but the oxen, not understanding \u2018English,\u2019 did just as well without it. But it did seem so truly comical to witness the bewildered look of some innocent brother, who, after having labored an hour or more to get [an ox] secured to one end of the yoke, would hold the other end aloft, trying to persuade [the other ox] to come under, only to see [the first] careering across the country, the yoke lashing the air, and he not even giving a hint as to when he intended to stop.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-95905_000_020\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Autobiography and Poems<\/span> (Salt Lake City, J.

John Davies was a loyalist during the American Revolutionary War. He had been instrumental in the establishment of the Church of England in America, which became known as the First Episcopal Society of Litchfield. These early immigrants had been taught that next to religion, loyalty was the cardinal virtue. They honestly considered that none but the infidel and traitor would venture to speak of revolution from the motherland. Some argued that any attempt to independence was rank ingratitude. They considered the king to be the head not only of their state but also of their religion.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/search-for-identity.p17\" class=\"\">John Davies recounts the challenge of building their first church in Litchfield, Connecticut, only to have it seriously damaged by soldiers of the Revolution.
