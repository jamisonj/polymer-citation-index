Some of them went on to achieve success in life, but too many of those gifted and able young people did not persevere and failed to achieve their potential. In contrast, several less visible young men and women at the same school worked diligently, persevered, and continued with their education and became outstanding doctors, engineers, educators, lawyers, scientists, businessmen, artisans, electricians, plumbers, and entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/perseverance.p17\" class=\"\">Success is usually earned by persevering and not becoming discouraged when we encounter challenges.

Benson and Lorenzo Snow, along with Elders Alma Smith and William W. Cluff, on a mission to the Hawaiian Islands. From Honolulu they took passage on a small boat to the little harbor of Lahaina. As they approached the reef, the surf was running high and a heavy swell struck the boat, carrying it about 50 yards and leaving it in a trough between two huge waves. When the second swell struck, the boat capsized into the foaming sea.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/perseverance.p20\" class=\"\">The people on the shore manned a lifeboat and picked up three of the brethren, who were swimming near the submerged boat. But there was no sign of Brother Snow. Hawaiians accustomed to the surf swam in every direction to search for him. Eventually one of them felt something in the water, and they pulled Brother Snow to the surface. His body was stiff, and he looked like he was dead as they hauled him into the boat.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/perseverance.p21\" class=\"\">Elder Smith and Elder Cluff laid Brother Snow\u2019s body across their laps and quietly administered to him, asking the Lord to spare his life that he might return to his family and home. When they reached the shore, they carried Brother Snow to some large empty barrels lying on the beach. Laying him face downwards on one of them, they rolled him back and forth to expel the water he had swallowed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/perseverance.p22\" class=\"\">After the elders worked over him for some time, without any indication of life, the bystanders said that nothing more could be done for him. But the determined elders would not give up. So they prayed again, with the quiet assurance that the Lord would hear and answer their prayers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/perseverance.p23\" class=\"\">They were impressed to do something rather unusual for that day and time. One of them placed his mouth over Brother Snow\u2019s in an effort to inflate his lungs, alternately blowing in and drawing out air, imitating the natural process of breathing. Taking turns, they persevered until they succeeded in inflating his lungs. A little while later they perceived faint indications of returning life. \u201cA slight wink of the eye, which, until then, had been open and death-like, and a very faint rattle in the throat, were the first symptoms of returning vitality. These grew more and more distinct, until consciousness was fully restored.\u201d With their perseverance and the smile of merciful Providence, all four of the Lord\u2019s servants survived and were able to complete their missions.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-25905_000_021\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Eliza R.
