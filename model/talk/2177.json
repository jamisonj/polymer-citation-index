But let me take just a moment to mention a little incident that made an impression upon me when I was a boy. This came to my mind when it was mentioned that there are with us this afternoon a large group of dedicated people who teach our youth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-teacher.p4\" class=\"\">It was on a summer day early in the morning. I was standing near the window. The curtains obstructed me from two little creatures out on the lawn. One was a large bird and the other a little bird, obviously just out of the nest. I saw the larger bird hop out on the lawn, then thump his feet and cock his head. He drew a big fat worm out of the lawn and came hopping back. The little bird opened its bill wide, but the big bird swallowed the worm.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-teacher.p5\" class=\"\">Then I saw the big bird fly up into a tree. He pecked at the bark for a little while and came back with a big bug in his mouth. The little bird opened his beak wide, but the big bird swallowed the bug. There was squawking in protest.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-teacher.p6\" class=\"\">The big bird flew away, and I didn\u2019t see it again, but I watched the little bird. After a while, the little bird hopped out on the lawn, thumped its feet, cocked its head, and pulled a big worm out of the lawn.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1972\/07\/a-teacher.p7\" class=\"\">God bless the good people who teach our children and our youth, I humbly pray, in Jesus\u2019 name. Amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
