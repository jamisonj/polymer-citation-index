It is character&mdash;character developed through obedience to the laws of life as\nrevealed through Jesus Christ, who came that we might have life and have it more abundantly\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28186\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28186)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28186)\">John 10:10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMan's chief concern in life should not be the acquiring of gold or of fame or of material\npossessions. It should not be the development of physical prowess, nor of intellectual strength,\nbut his aim, the highest in life, should be the development of a Christlike character.\n<\/p><p>\nOne of the most significant statements in the Word of Wisdom, one which carries with it\nevidence of the inspiration of the Prophet Joseph Smith, is found in the following statement,\n\"In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men\nin the last days, I have warned you, and forewarned you, by giving unto you this word of\nwisdom by revelation&mdash;\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14643\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14643)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14643)\">D&amp;C 89:4<\/a><\/span>) \". . . evils and designs which do and will exist in the\nhearts of conspiring men . . .\"&mdash;the purport of that statement impressed me way back in the\ntwenties and thirties of this century.\n<\/p><p>\nI ask you to recall the methods employed by certain tobacco interests to induce women to\nsmoke cigarettes. You remember how insidiously they launched their plan: first, by saying\nthat smoking would reduce weight. Their slogan was: \"Take a cigarette instead of a sweet.\"\nLater, some of us noticed in the theater that they would have a young woman light the\ngentleman's cigarette. Following this a woman's hand would be shown on billboards lighting\nor taking a cigarette. A year or two passed, and soon they were brazen enough to show the\nwoman on the screen or on the billboard smoking the cigarette.\n<\/p><p>\nI have a newspaper clipping which I set aside in 1931 which corroborates this idea. It reads:\n\"It is well-known that the cigarette manufacturers are now after the young women and girls.\nThey say there are twenty-five million of these in the United States, and if they can\npopularize smoking among them, they will be able to increase their sales from three billions,\nsix hundred million dollars annually, to six billion dollars. This is their claim and their aim.\"\n<\/p><p>\nNow, as you all know, it is common to see beautiful young women depicted on billboards and\nin magazine advertisements smoking cigarettes, and now most insidious of all are the cigarette\nadvertisements which come into our homes by way of television and are viewed by our boys\nand girls, showing young men and young women smoking in the most enticing scenes\npossible.\n<\/p><p>\nDo these conspiring men have evil designs upon our youth? Keep your eyes and ears open to\nobserve if they are not taking the same steps now to get our boys interested as they did to\nentice women to use that vile weed.\n<\/p><p>\nOur youth should be taught the hazards of cigarette smoking to health. They should be taught\nthat doctors and scientists now have established a direct tie to cancer and cigarette smoking.\n<\/p><p>\nEmerson Foote, chairman of the National Interagency Council on Smoking and Health, has\ntestified that \"it has been concluded by responsible scientific authorities that cigarette\nsmoking is responsible for at least 125,000 and possibly 300,000 deaths a year in this country.\n<\/p><p>\n\"But death is not the only thing . . . It is beyond doubt that there are millions of people who\nsuffer varying degrees of disability brought on by cigarette smoking.\" (Washington\n[Associated Press], <i>Deseret News<\/i>, March 23, 1965, p. A-7.)\n<\/p><p>\nSomewhere between sixty and eighty percent of boys and men and a somewhat lesser number\nof girls and women are already habituated to cigarettes or they are confirmed addicts.\n<\/p><p>\nThe high death rates from cigarette smoking have created a demand from many interested\ngroups for positive action that will lessen the dangers to health. The Royal College of\nPhysicians of Great Britain, the American Cancer Society, and the United States Public Health\nService have led the way in creating public reaction against smoking. The Cancer Society has\nsupported research generously and has kept the public and the medical profession informed on\nthe problems connected with smoking. The Surgeon General of the Public Health Service has\nused his official and moral influence in emphasizing the dangers involved in smoking.\n<\/p><p>\nThese agencies, as well as the great body of research scientists, have compiled the evidence\nand stated the facts so clearly that every reasonable mind is fully aware of the danger entailed\nfrom smoking.\n<\/p><p>\nNotwithstanding the admission of danger from smoking, the advertising of cigarettes by the\ntobacco companies has been stepped up to an all-time peak. Yet there is never a hint that\nsmoking is already a major threat to life. Instead, the advertising constantly emphasizes the\nmildness of the cigarette and its pleasurable qualities. This cigarette advertising is promoted\nwith such reckless abandon, in spite of what research has already proved regarding the\ndangers from smoking, that the most charitable conclusion to be drawn is that the promoters\nhave no regard whatever for the value of human life. It seems that success for the tobacco\nindustry is more important than the avoiding of suffering and of death.\n<\/p><p>\nOne hundred thirty-two years ago a twenty-seven-year-old youth told the world that tobacco\nwas harmful for the human body. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day\nSaints were given by divine revelation the Word of Wisdom, in which they were advised to\nrefrain from the use of tobacco in any form. They were promised better health as a result.\nThis was strange as no one knew of any danger from smoking at that time. Most of the\nmembers accepted and applied the instructions given.\n<\/p><p>\nThe demonstration presented today by more than two million people of the Church should be\nimpressive to any skeptic. Hundreds of thousands of teenage youths have never smoked. They\nknow that smoking is a destructive habit that mars the human body as well as the mind.\n<\/p><p>\nOur homes should establish the fact that the boy who indulges in cigarettes is not contributing\nto his advancement and growth in the Church and kingdom of God; neither is he preparing\nhimself for his responsible place in society. The word of God to the Prophet Joseph Smith is\nthat tobacco is not good for man (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"14645\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 14645)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(14645)\">D&amp;C 89:8<\/a><\/span>).\nThe statement is not qualified in any way. Scientists have\ndemonstrated it; men who have tried to disprove it have failed; and we as a people stand\ncommitted to that command from God. Keep the habit of smoking and the use of tobacco in\nany form out of the lives of our boys. Resistance of the appetite will react upon the character\nand strengthen it, and just because a man has developed the habit is no justification for his\ncontinuing it. Just because some man may think he is immune from the ill effects of tobacco\nis no justification for its use in the priesthood of God.\n<\/p><p>\nFathers and members of the priesthood have the obligation of setting an example worthy of\nimitation to the youth. Boys want to look upon you as men. Their ideals incorporate in your\nlife all the Christlike attributes, as nearly as you can develop them, which Christ had when the\nRoman governor pointed to him saying, \"Behold the man!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28221\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28221)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28221)\">John 19:5<\/a><\/span>). Remember, even\nthough you have the habit, overcoming it will make you stronger.\n<\/p><p>\n\"It is easy enough to be virtuous<br \/>\n     When nothing tempts you to stray,<br \/>\n     When without or within no voice of sin<br \/>\n     Is luring your soul away.<br \/>\n     But it is only a negative virtue<br \/>\n     Until it is tried by fire,<br \/>\n     And the soul that is worth the honor of earth<br \/>\n     Is the soul that resists desire.\"<br \/><br \/>\n&nbsp; &nbsp;     (Adapted from Ella Wheeler Wilcox, \"Worth While.\")\n<\/p><p>\nTo our boys I would say that if they want to live physically; if they want to be men strong in\nbody, vigorous in mind; if they want to be good in sports, enter the basketball game, enter the\nfootball game, enter the contest in running and jumping; if they want to be good Scouts; if\nthey want to be good citizens, in business, anywhere, avoid tobacco and live strictly the\nreligious life.\n<\/p><p>\nMay God help us as men of the priesthood, as fathers, to reach our boys and young men and\nimpress upon them this great lesson, this divine truth, that to be carnally minded is to be\nmiserable, unhappy, but to be spiritually minded, which means to obey the principles of the\ngospel in all that it means, is to have life, life eternal and peace\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42791\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42791)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42791)\">Rom. 8:6<\/a><\/span>), I humbly pray in the name\nof Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
