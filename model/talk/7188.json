Many of us have served as full-time missionaries, some of us presently are serving as full-time missionaries, and all of us now are serving and will continue to serve as lifelong missionaries. We are missionaries every day in our families, in our schools, in our places of employment, and in our communities. Regardless of our age, experience, or station in life, we are all missionaries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p6\" class=\"\">Proclaiming the gospel is not an activity in which we periodically and temporarily engage. And our labors as missionaries certainly are not confined to the short period of time devoted to full-time missionary service in our youth or in our mature years. Rather, the obligation to proclaim the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is inherent in the oath and covenant of the priesthood into which we enter. Missionary work essentially is a priesthood responsibility, and all of us who hold the priesthood are the Lord\u2019s authorized servants on the earth and are missionaries at all times and in all places\u2014and we always will be. Our very identity as holders of the priesthood and the seed of Abraham is in large measure defined by the responsibility to proclaim the gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p7\" class=\"\">My message tonight is applicable to all of us in our priesthood duty to proclaim the gospel. My specific purpose in this priesthood meeting, however, is to talk candidly with the young men of the Church who are preparing for the call to serve as missionaries. The principles I will discuss with you are both simple and spiritually significant, and they should cause us to ponder, to evaluate, and to improve. I pray for the companionship of the Holy Ghost for me and for you as we consider together this important subject.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>A Frequently Asked Question<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p9\" class=\"\">In meetings with young members of the Church around the world, I often invite those in attendance to ask questions. One of the questions I am asked most frequently by young men is this: \u201cWhat can I do to prepare most effectively to serve as a full-time missionary?\u201d Such a sincere question deserves a serious response.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p10\" class=\"\">My dear young brethren, the single most important thing you can do to prepare for a call to serve is to <span class=\"emphasis\">become<\/span> a missionary long before you go on a mission. Please notice that in my answer I emphasized <span class=\"emphasis\">becoming<\/span> rather than <span class=\"emphasis\">going.<\/span> Let me explain what I mean.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p11\" class=\"\">In our customary Church vocabulary, we often speak of <span class=\"emphasis\">going<\/span> to church, <span class=\"emphasis\">going<\/span> to the temple, and <span class=\"emphasis\">going<\/span> on a mission. Let me be so bold as to suggest that our rather routine emphasis on <span class=\"emphasis\">going<\/span> misses the mark.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p12\" class=\"\">The issue is not going to church; rather, the issue is worshipping and renewing covenants as we attend church. The issue is not going to or through the temple; rather, the issue is having in our hearts the spirit, the covenants, and the ordinances of the Lord\u2019s house. The issue is not going on a mission; rather, the issue is becoming a missionary and serving throughout our entire life with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength. It is possible for a young man to <span class=\"emphasis\">go<\/span> on a mission and not <span class=\"emphasis\">become<\/span> a missionary, and this is not what the Lord requires or what the Church needs.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p13\" class=\"\">My earnest hope for each of you young men is that you will not simply go on a mission\u2014but that you will become missionaries long before you submit your mission papers, long before you receive a call to serve, long before you are set apart by your stake president, and long before you enter the MTC.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>The Principle of Becoming<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p15\" class=\"\">Elder Dallin H. Oaks has taught us most effectively about the challenge to become something instead of just doing expected things or performing certain actions:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cThe Apostle Paul taught that the Lord\u2019s teachings and teachers were given that we may all attain \u2018the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ\u2019 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44559\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44559)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44559)\">Eph. 4:13<\/a><\/span>). This process requires far more than acquiring knowledge. It is not even enough for us to be <span class=\"emphasis\">convinced<\/span> of the gospel; we must act and think so that we are <span class=\"emphasis\">converted<\/span> by it. In contrast to the institutions of the world, which teach us to <span class=\"emphasis\">know<\/span> something, the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to <span class=\"emphasis\">become<\/span> something. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p17\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2026 It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become\u201d (\u201cThe Challenge to Become,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Liahona,<\/span> Jan. 2001, 40; <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 2000, 32).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p18\" class=\"\">Brethren, the challenge to become applies precisely and perfectly to missionary preparation. Obviously, the process of becoming a missionary does not require a young man to wear a white shirt and tie to school every day or to follow the missionary guidelines for going to bed and getting up, although most parents certainly would support that idea. But you can increase in your desire to serve God (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"44688\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44688)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44688)\">D&amp;C 4:3<\/a><\/span>), and you can begin to think as missionaries think, to read what missionaries read, to pray as missionaries pray, and to feel what missionaries feel. You can avoid the worldly influences that cause the Holy Ghost to withdraw, and you can grow in confidence in recognizing and responding to spiritual promptings. Line upon line and precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, you can gradually become the missionary you hope to be and the missionary the Savior expects.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p19\" class=\"\">You will not suddenly or magically be transformed into a prepared and obedient missionary on the day you walk through the front door of the Missionary Training Center. What you have become in the days and months and years prior to your missionary service is what you will be in the MTC. In fact, the nature of the transition through which you will pass in the MTC will be a strong indicator of your progress in becoming a missionary.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p20\" class=\"\">As you enter the MTC, you obviously will miss your family, and many aspects of your daily schedule will be new and challenging. But for a young man well on his way to becoming a missionary, the basic adjustment to the rigors of missionary work and lifestyle will not be overwhelming, burdensome, or constraining. Thus, a key element of raising the bar includes working to become a missionary before going on a mission.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p21\" class=\"\">Fathers, do you understand your role in helping your son to become a missionary before he goes on a mission? You and your wife are key in the process of his becoming a missionary. Priesthood and auxiliary leaders, do you recognize your responsibility to assist parents and to help every young man become a missionary before he goes on a mission? The bar also has been raised for parents and for all members of the Church. Prayerful pondering of the principle of becoming will invite inspiration tailored to the specific needs of your son or to the young men whom you serve.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p22\" class=\"\">The preparation I am describing is not oriented only toward your missionary service as a 19- or 20- or 21-year-old young man. Brethren, you are preparing for a lifetime of missionary work. As holders of the priesthood, we are missionaries always. If you truly progress in the process of becoming a missionary, both before going on a mission and in the mission field, then when the day arrives for your honorable release as a full-time missionary, you will depart from your field of labor and return to your family\u2014but you will never cease your missionary service. A priesthood holder is a missionary at all times and in all places. A missionary is who and what we are as bearers of the priesthood and as the seed of Abraham.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2>The Seed of Abraham<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p24\" class=\"\">The heirs of all the promises and covenants made by God to Abraham are referred to as <span class=\"emphasis\">the seed of Abraham<\/span> (see Bible Dictionary, \u201cSeed of Abraham,\u201d 771). These blessings are obtained only by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Brethren, the process of becoming a missionary is directly related to understanding who we are as the seed of Abraham.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p25\" class=\"\">Abraham was a great prophet who desired righteousness and was obedient to all of the commandments he received from God, including the command to offer as a sacrifice his precious son, Isaac. Because of his steadfastness and obedience, Abraham is often referred to as the father of the faithful, and Heavenly Father established a covenant with and promised great blessings to Abraham and his posterity:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cBecause thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cThat in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p28\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou has obeyed my voice\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44443\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44443)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44443)\">Gen. 22:16\u201318<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p29\" class=\"\">Thus, Abraham was promised a great posterity and that the nations of the earth would be blessed through that posterity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p30\" class=\"\">How are the nations of the earth blessed through the seed of Abraham? The answer to this important question is found in the book of Abraham:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd I will make of thee [Abraham] a great nation, and I will bless thee above measure, and make thy name great among all nations, and thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed after thee, that in their hands they shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p32\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd I will bless them through thy name; for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44778\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44778)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44778)\">Abr. 2:9\u201310<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p33\" class=\"\">We learn in these verses that Abraham\u2019s faithful heirs would have the blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the authority of the priesthood. Thus, the phrase \u201cbear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations\u201d refers to the responsibility to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ and to invite all to receive by proper priesthood authority the ordinances of salvation. Truly, great responsibility rests upon the seed of Abraham in these latter days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p34\" class=\"\">How do these promises and blessings relate to us today? Either by literal lineage or adoption, every man and boy within the sound of my voice tonight is a rightful heir to the promises made by God to Abraham. We are the seed of Abraham. One of the primary reasons we receive a patriarchal blessing is to help us more fully understand who we are as the posterity of Abraham and to recognize the responsibility that rests upon us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p35\" class=\"\">My beloved brethren, you and I, today and always, are to bless all peoples in all the nations of the earth. You and I, today and always, are to bear witness of Jesus Christ and declare the message of the Restoration. You and I, today and always, are to invite all to receive the ordinances of salvation. Proclaiming the gospel is not a part-time priesthood obligation. It is not simply an activity in which we engage for a limited time or an assignment we must complete as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Rather, missionary work is a manifestation of our spiritual identity and heritage. We were foreordained in the premortal existence and born into mortality to fulfill the covenant and promise God made to Abraham. We are here upon the earth at this time to magnify the priesthood and to preach the gospel. That is who we are, and that is why we are here\u2014today and always.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/becoming-a-missionary.p36\" class=\"\">You may enjoy music, athletics, or be mechanically inclined, and someday you may work in a trade or a profession or in the arts.
