Sometimes our stories feel very intense, and we would like to read ahead to know our own end, to make sure that everything is going to turn out all right. While we don\u2019t know the particular details of our life\u2019s experiences, fortunately we do know something about our futures, if we live worthily.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/all-things-shall-work-together-for-your-good.p7\" class=\"\">We are given this insight in Doctrine and Covenants 90:24 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43604\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43604)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43604)\">D&amp;C 90:24<\/a><\/span>]: \u201cSearch diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly.\u201d This stunning promise from the Lord that all things shall work together for our good is repeated many times in the scriptures, particularly to people or prophets who are suffering through the trials of their own life stories.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/all-things-shall-work-together-for-your-good.p8\" class=\"\">I sense that this promise comes from a tender, caring Father who desires to bless us and give us reason to hope through our earthly journey. Knowing that eventually all things will work together for our good will help us endure affliction like the faithful people from the scriptures who knew of His promises and trusted in them, \u201chaving seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43359\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43359)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43359)\">Heb. 11:13<\/a><\/span>).

While it may be true in some instances that our promised blessings will be fulfilled only in the eternities, it is also true that as we search, pray, and believe, we will often recognize things working together for our good in this life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/all-things-shall-work-together-for-your-good.p10\" class=\"\">As I read the stories of Jesus\u2019 Apostles after His death, I see that they were frequently and brutally persecuted, stoned, and imprisoned. But they lived with courage and faith. They knew that ultimately all things would work together for their good. They also knew that through interim blessings and miracles, things were working out. They were sustained, tutored, and protected. They embraced the promises not only afar off but here and now as well.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/all-things-shall-work-together-for-your-good.p11\" class=\"\">A wonderful miracle happened in Peter\u2019s life when he was imprisoned by King Herod. His fellow Apostle James had just been killed, and now Peter was thrown into jail, carefully guarded by 16 men. I wonder if he felt like the Prophet Joseph Smith felt as he suffered in Liberty Jail. It was while Joseph was there that the Lord promised him that \u201call these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43622\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43622)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43622)\">D&amp;C 122:7<\/a><\/span>). It might be hard to believe in this promise in the midst of such trials, but Peter, like Joseph, was blessed by the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/all-things-shall-work-together-for-your-good.p12\" class=\"\">The people of the Church were gathered together praying \u201cwithout ceasing\u201d in Peter\u2019s behalf. Then something wonderful happened. During the night when Peter was sleeping between two soldiers and was bound with two chains, an angel of the Lord \u201ccame upon him\u201d and \u201craised him up,\u201d and \u201chis chains fell off from his hands.\u201d Peter wondered if he were in a dream. He followed the angel past the guards through an iron gate and out to a city street, \u201cand forthwith the angel departed from him.\u201d Peter then realized it was not a dream. He had been miraculously delivered. The Lord was blessing him right then.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/all-things-shall-work-together-for-your-good.p13\" class=\"\">He went to the home where members of the Church were gathered together praying for him. When Peter knocked, a young woman (just like you young women) named Rhoda came to the gate. She heard and recognized Peter\u2019s voice. The scriptures say she was glad. But in her excitement she forgot to let him in. Instead, she ran back to share with the others the great news that Peter stood at the gate. They didn\u2019t believe her and argued with her, saying she didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. Meanwhile Peter still knocked and waited. When they finally came to him, \u201cthey were astonished\u201d (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"43318\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43318)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43318)\">Acts 12:4\u201317<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/all-things-shall-work-together-for-your-good.p14\" class=\"\">These people had been continually praying for a miracle to occur, but when the Lord answered their prayers, they were amazed. They were surprised at the Lord\u2019s goodness in His miraculous response. Do we recognize the fulfilling of promises in our lives? As the Savior asked, \u201cHaving eyes, see ye not?\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43287\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43287)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43287)\">Mark 8:18<\/a><\/span>).

They will sustain us as we carry our earthly burdens. Often in our lives, those angels are the people around us, the people who love us, those who allow themselves to be instruments in the Lord\u2019s hands. President Spencer W. Kimball said: \u201cGod does notice us, and he watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other in the kingdom\u201d (\u201cThere Is Purpose in Life,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">New Era,<\/span> Sept. 1974, 5).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/all-things-shall-work-together-for-your-good.p16\" class=\"\">I appreciate wonderful young women and Young Women leaders, mothers and fathers, and good friends who strengthen one another.

Alexis is hearing impaired, and I worried about how I could help her fit in and show her that she was one of us.

I pulled Alexis and her mom in front of the girls and said (signing to Alexis), \u2018We have a gift for you. Now you are one of us.\u2019 Then we stood and repeated the theme and did it in sign language. The Spirit was so strong, and there weren\u2019t many voices because we were all crying, but the girls did a beautiful job. Alexis was beaming.

Because she is deaf, I am often at her side interpreting for her. You can imagine the feelings that flooded through me as the young women all began to sign the Young Women theme for her. As I stood there watching with tears in my eyes, the verse that ran through my mind was from Matthew 25:40 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43285\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43285)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43285)\">Matt. 25:40<\/a><\/span>]: \u2018Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/all-things-shall-work-together-for-your-good.p26\" class=\"\">\u201cThe remarkable love and service these young women have shown just began on that day.

We thought about the words and signed it for someone else so that [she] could know the words too, and that made me happy to know that she could understand our theme and know that she was a daughter of God too.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2004\/05\/all-things-shall-work-together-for-your-good.p30\" class=\"\">Even the young men got involved.
