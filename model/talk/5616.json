Elder Bruce R. McConkie stated: \u201cAnyone serving in any capacity in the Church in which he is responsible for the spiritual or temporal well-being of any of the Lord\u2019s children is a shepherd to those sheep. The Lord holds his shepherds accountable for the safety [meaning the salvation] of his sheep.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-95905_000_022\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Mormon Doctrine<\/span> (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1966), p. 710.]<\/span><\/sup> The bearers of the priesthood have this great responsibility, whether it is father, grandfather, home teacher, elders quorum president, bishop, stake president, or other Church calling.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/responsibilities-of-shepherds.p8\" class=\"\">Initially, I speak to the worthy young men of the Aaronic Priesthood. When I was a very small boy, my father found a lamb all alone out in the desert. The herd of sheep to which its mother belonged had moved on, and somehow the lamb got separated from its mother, and the shepherd must not have known that it was lost. Because it could not survive alone in the desert, my father picked it up and brought it home. To have left the lamb there would have meant certain death, either by falling prey to the coyotes or by starvation because it was so young that it still needed milk. Some sheepmen call these lambs \u201cbummers.\u201d My father gave the lamb to me and I became its shepherd.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/responsibilities-of-shepherds.p9\" class=\"\">For several weeks I warmed cow\u2019s milk in a baby\u2019s bottle and fed the lamb. We became fast friends. I called him Nigh\u2014why I don\u2019t remember. It began to grow. My lamb and I would play on the lawn. Sometimes we would lie together on the grass and I would lay my head on its soft, woolly side and look up at the blue sky and the white billowing clouds. I did not lock my lamb up during the day. It would not run away. It soon learned to eat grass. I could call my lamb from anywhere in the yard by just imitating as best I could the bleating sound of a sheep: <span class=\"emphasis\">Baa. Baa.<\/span><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/responsibilities-of-shepherds.p10\" class=\"\">One night there came a terrible storm. I forgot to put my lamb in the barn that night as I should have done. I went to bed. My little friend was frightened in the storm, and I could hear it bleating. I knew that I should help my pet, but I wanted to stay safe, warm, and dry in my bed. I didn\u2019t get up as I should have done. The next morning I went out to find my lamb dead. A dog had also heard its bleating cry and killed it. My heart was broken. I had not been a good shepherd or steward of that which my father had entrusted to me. My father said, \u201cSon, couldn\u2019t I trust you to take care of just one lamb?\u201d My father\u2019s remark hurt me more than losing my woolly friend. I resolved that day, as a little boy, that I would try never again to neglect my stewardship as a shepherd if I were ever placed in that position again.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/responsibilities-of-shepherds.p11\" class=\"\">Not too many years thereafter I was called as a junior companion to a home teacher. There were times when it was so cold or stormy and I wanted to stay home and be comfortable, but in my mind\u2019s ear I could hear my little lamb bleating, and I knew I needed to be a good shepherd and go with my senior companion. In all those many years, whenever I have had a desire to shirk my duties, there would come to me a remembrance of how sorry I was that night so many years ago when I had not been a good shepherd. I have not always done everything I should have, but I have tried.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/responsibilities-of-shepherds.p12\" class=\"\">I should like to speak for a few minutes about the constitutional duties of the Lord\u2019s shepherds.
