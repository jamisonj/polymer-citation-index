Carolyn was not a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but she had felt particularly welcome in her new circle of associates. She eagerly joined them for the climb.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/prophets-in-the-land-again.p6\" class=\"\">As the sun steadily rose, so did the hikers on the mountainside. Then, as the ten o\u2019clock hour approached, the group began to find places to sit down. Carolyn thought, \u201cThis is wonderful. How did they know I needed the rest?\u201d and she, too, looked for a comfortable spot to stretch out. But the participants seemed unusually earnest about this particular break, some pulling out pencils and notebooks while one intently dialed a transistor radio.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/prophets-in-the-land-again.p7\" class=\"\">What then happened would be a turning point in her life forever. One of her friends said, \u201cCarolyn, we need to explain something. This is the first Saturday in October, and for us that means not only lovely weather and bright fall foliage, but it also means a general conference of the Church. As Latter-day Saints, wherever we are or whatever we are doing, we stop and listen. So we are going to sit here among the oak and the pines, look out over the valley below, and listen to the prophets of God for a couple of hours.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/prophets-in-the-land-again.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cA couple of hours!\u201d thought Carolyn. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there were prophets of God still living,\u201d she said, \u201cand I certainly didn\u2019t know there were two hours\u2019 worth!\u201d Little did she know that they were going to stop again at two o\u2019clock that afternoon for another two hours and then invite her to tune in at home for four more the next day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/prophets-in-the-land-again.p9\" class=\"\">Well, the rest is history. With the gift of a leather-bound copy of the scriptures from her students, the love of friends and families in the LDS ward she began to attend, and spiritual experiences we want all who make their way into the light of the gospel to have, Carolyn was baptized and confirmed a member of the Church. The rest is, as they say, history. With her introduction to general conference that day sitting high atop Y Mountain, Sister Rasmus had seen her own personal fulfillment of Isaiah\u2019s prophetic invitation: \u201cCome ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-26911_000_040\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"45253\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45253)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45253)\">Isaiah 2:3<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/prophets-in-the-land-again.p10\" class=\"\">We are coming to the close of another marvelous general conference. We have been blessed to hear messages from our leaders, including and especially President Gordon B. Hinckley, the man we sustain as God\u2019s oracle on earth, our living prophet, seer, and revelator. As prophets have done in dispensations from Adam down to the present day, President Hinckley has figuratively gathered us in a kind of global equivalent of the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, has loved us and taught us and bestowed upon us his blessing.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-26911_000_040\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"45719\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45719)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45719)\">D&amp;C 107:53\u201356<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/prophets-in-the-land-again.p11\" class=\"\">I think it is safe to say that the prayer all the brethren and sisters have had as they have spoken this weekend is that general conference will have been as uplifting, and if needful as life-changing for each of us as it was for Sister Rasmus and countless thousands of others who semi-annually respond to our LDS hymn, \u201cCome, listen to a prophet\u2019s voice, and hear the word of God.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-26911_000_040\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cCome, Listen to a Prophet\u2019s Voice,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 21.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/prophets-in-the-land-again.p12\" class=\"\">In my own expression of testimony and gratitude for the messages and meaning of general conference, may I suggest three things these twice-yearly gatherings declare to all the world.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/prophets-in-the-land-again.p13\" class=\"\">First, they declare eagerly and unequivocally that there is again a living prophet on the earth speaking in the name of the Lord. And how we need such guidance! Our times are turbulent and difficult. We see wars inter-nationally and distress domestically. Neighbors all around us face personal heartaches and family sorrows. Legions know fear and troubles of a hundred kinds. This reminds us that when those mists of darkness enveloped the travelers in Lehi\u2019s vision of the tree of life, it enveloped <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> of the participants\u2014the righteous as well as the unrighteous, the young along with the elderly, the new convert and seasoned member alike. In that allegory all face opposition and travail, and only the rod of iron\u2014the declared word of God\u2014can bring them safely through. We <span class=\"emphasis\">all<\/span> need that rod. We all need that word. No one is safe without it, for in its absence any can \u201c[fall] away into forbidden paths and [be] lost,\u201d as the record says.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-26911_000_040\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"45458\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45458)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45458)\">1 Nephi 8:28<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"45457\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 45457)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(45457)\">vv. 23\u201324<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> How grateful we are to have heard God\u2019s voice and felt the strength of that iron rod in this conference these past two days.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/prophets-in-the-land-again.p14\" class=\"\">Not often but over the years some sources have suggested that the Brethren are out of touch in their declarations, that they don\u2019t know the issues, that some of their policies and practices are out-of-date, not relevant to our times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/prophets-in-the-land-again.p15\" class=\"\">As the least of those who have been sustained by you to witness the guidance of this Church firsthand, I say with all the fervor of my soul that never in my personal or professional life have I ever associated with any group who are so <span class=\"emphasis\">in<\/span> touch, who know so profoundly the issues facing us, who look so deeply into the old, stay so open to the new, and weigh so carefully, thoughtfully, and prayerfully everything in between. I testify that the grasp this body of men and women have of moral and societal issues exceeds that of any think tank or brain trust of comparable endeavor of which I know anywhere on the earth. I bear personal witness of how thoroughly good they are, of how hard they work, and how humbly they live. It is no trivial matter for this Church to declare to the world prophecy, seership, and revelation, but we do declare it. It is true light shining in a dark world, and it shines from these proceedings.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/prophets-in-the-land-again.p16\" class=\"\">Secondly, each of these conferences marks a call to action not only in our own lives but also on behalf of others around us, those who are of our own family and faith and those who are not. This morning President Hinckley movingly reminded us that this is the 150th anniversary of those handcart companies that, as general conference was convening in October of 1856 here in the Salt Lake Valley, were staggering through the last freezing miles of Nebraska and were soon to be stranded in the impassable snows of the high country of Wyoming.
