Marriages are failing at alarming rates. Far too many children are abused and neglected. Women struggle to hear the voice of righteous truth amid a confusing cacophony of voices persuasively urging them toward expediency and political correctness. There are many among our own 4.2 million Relief Society members who are hurting and confused. Do we realize what we have, sisters? Do we understand who we are? Do we fully appreciate that within the organization of the Relief Society we have all of the tools and resources we need to soothe a single soul or to heal a troubled world?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/come-to-relief-society.p10\" class=\"\">The first objective of Relief Society is to build faith in Jesus Christ and to teach one another the doctrines of the kingdom of God. Through Relief Society lessons, activities, and shared experiences, you can gain a testimony or you can strengthen the testimony you already have. When it comes right down to it, that may be the single most important thing we do in Relief Society, for the spiritual strength and secure testimonies of the women of the Church are absolutely vital\u2014to themselves, to their families, to their branches and wards, and to the world itself.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/come-to-relief-society.p11\" class=\"\">The second objective of Relief Society is to help each sister understand that she is a beloved spirit daughter of Heavenly Father, and as such she has a divine nature and destiny, including the most marvelous of all possibilities: eternal life in the presence of God as His heir. Once again quoting President Kimball: \u201cWhere else can you learn who you really are? Where else can you be given the necessary explanations and assurances about the nature of life? From what other source can you learn about your own uniqueness and identity?\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-98911_000_038\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">My Beloved Sisters,<\/span> 43.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/come-to-relief-society.p12\" class=\"\">When we fully understand that we are daughters of God with rights and privileges that extend throughout eternity\u2014that we are entitled to blessings from Him, dependent upon our faithfulness\u2014then we will look at the world, and our place in it and our responsibility to it, in a different way. Listen to what President Gordon B. Hinckley tells us: \u201cKnow that you are daughters of God, children with a divine birthright. Walk in the sun with your heads high, knowing that you are loved and honored, that you are a part of his kingdom, and that there is for you a great work to be done which cannot be left to others.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-98911_000_038\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cLive Up to Your Inheritance,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1983, 84.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/come-to-relief-society.p13\" class=\"\">What is the work to which President Hinckley refers\u2014a work \u201cwhich cannot be left to others\u201d? The answer, as you might expect, can be found in Relief Society. The third objective of Relief Society states each sister is encouraged to reach out and serve those in her family, her ward, and her community. As sisters, we have the ability and the responsibility to help each other walk in the light of the Lord. No matter where we live and regardless of our age, nationality, marital status, or Church calling, there are those around us who need our love and service.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/come-to-relief-society.p14\" class=\"\">We are all familiar with the life and work of the late Mother Teresa, who spent most of her life laboring among the world\u2019s poor and impoverished and did much to relieve sorrow and suffering. Once when she was in Australia, she offered to clean the hut of a lonely Aborigine man. In his hut was a beautiful but unlit lamp. When asked why he didn\u2019t light it, he replied, \u201cNobody comes here.\u201d She made him promise that he would light the lamp, and she promised to have the sisters visit him. Later the man sent word to Mother Teresa: \u201cTell my friend, the light she lit in my life is still burning!\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-98911_000_038\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See <span class=\"emphasis\">My Life for the Poor: Mother Teresa of Calcutta,<\/span> ed.

We can give hope, we can lift, and we can inspire. We can teach of Christ and help others find peace and comfort within His light. As women, we have natural tendencies to love and nourish. Women teach children, bolster friends, encourage husbands, and cheer on the disheartened. Women are givers of life and nurturers of the living. Every one of us has something to give, something to share, and someone to serve. As the second president of the Relief Society, Eliza R. Snow, declared, \u201cThere is no sister so isolated \u2026 her sphere so narrow but what she can do a great deal towards establishing the Kingdom of God upon the earth.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-98911_000_038\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Woman\u2019s Exponent,<\/span> 15 Sept. 1873, 62.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/come-to-relief-society.p16\" class=\"\">The fourth objective of Relief Society is to strengthen and protect families. Has there ever been a time in all of history when that strength and protection was more desperately needed? It is my sincere belief that the most powerful protection against the deteriorating condition of the family is a faithful, righteous mother. In 1993 President Hinckley said: \u201cI remind mothers everywhere of the sanctity of your calling. No other can adequately take your place. No responsibility is greater, no obligation more binding than that you rear in love and peace and integrity those whom you have brought into the world.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote9-98911_000_038\">9<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cBring Up a Child in the Way He Should Go,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1993, 60.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/come-to-relief-society.p17\" class=\"\">As a Relief Society general presidency we reaffirm that motherhood is the most noble work a woman can be engaged in. As we do so, however, we remember that there are many among the most devoted women of the Church who have not as yet had the opportunity to experience motherhood for themselves. For them, the words of Elder Dallin H. Oaks provide insight: \u201cWe know that many worthy and wonderful Latter-day Saints currently lack the ideal opportunities and essential requirements for their progress. Singleness, childlessness, death, and divorce frustrate ideals and postpone the fulfillment of promised blessings. In addition, some women who desire to be full-time mothers and homemakers have been literally compelled to enter the full-time workforce. But these frustrations are only temporary. The Lord has promised that in the eternities no blessing will be denied his sons and daughters who keep the commandments, are true to their covenants, and desire what is right.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote10-98911_000_038\">10<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cThe Great Plan of Happiness,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1993, 75.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/come-to-relief-society.p18\" class=\"\">Our fifth objective is to help each sister feel needed, included, valued, and loved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1998\/11\/come-to-relief-society.p19\" class=\"\">In Relief Society we share our love for each other and for our Heavenly Father.
