Burton, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1970, pp. 90-92<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nIt used to be said of a Mormon that his word was as good as his bond. Once a Mormon gave\nhis word, you could rely on it. Even if it meant a personal sacrifice of money, time, or effort,\nonce he gave his word you could depend on him to do as he promised. Is the same thing true\ntoday?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Honesty takes many forms<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHonesty can take many forms, such as giving a full day's work for a full day's pay. Can one\nbe considered honest who loafs on his job; who does not take pains with his work; who\nwastes time in the rest room, around the water fountain, or who stretches his lunch hour an\nextra 15 minutes? It is easy to compile a list of dishonest business practices that take money\nfrom an employer. We can name such things as making unnecessary personal telephone calls,\ncoming late to work, taking home paper, pencils, postage stamps, or mailing personal letters\nthrough the company postage meter. Such practices once frowned on are almost universally\naccepted today with the excuse that \"everyone does it.\" The fact of the matter is that everyone\n<i>doesn't<\/i> do it. There are still many honest people in this world.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Honesty within the family<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHonesty includes more than material things. There must be honesty within the family. A man\nmust be honest with his wife and a wife honest with her husband. Children must be honest\nwith parents and parents honest with their children. Honesty involves loyalty to family,\nfriends, neighbors, the community, and the nation. Honesty is a host of little things that make\na person trustworthy. Honesty is a fundamental principle in the true worship of a kind, loving\nFather in heaven. One of the reasons the Father loved the Son so much was because he was\ntrustworthy. Jesus said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.\n<\/p><p>\n\"No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I\nhave power to take it up again. This commandment have I received of my Father\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28586\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28586)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28586)\">John 10:17-18<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJesus used the power God gave him to help others. How wonderful if that same testimony\ncould apply to us in our dealings with others. How wonderful if we could likewise say:\nTherefore doth my Father love me, because I do what he asks me to do.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Sharpness in business dealings<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI devoutly wish that <i>all<\/i> members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints could be\nnumbered among the honest, trustworthy people of this world. Some members of the Church\nsuccumb to the world in which they live. They wear their religion on Sunday, but forget it\nwhen they enter the business world. There they become as sharp and untrustworthy in\nbusiness dealings as some of their associates. You can be both successful and honest&mdash;in\nfact, you can be more successful as an honest man than you ever can as a self-seeking,\ndishonest person.\n<\/p><p>\nNo one is born honest. No one is born dishonest. We have to be taught to be honest. We have\nto experience the pain, worry, and discomfort of dishonesty to know that truly, \"honesty <i>is<\/i> the\nbest policy.\" The prophet Alma told his son Corianton, \"Behold, I say unto you, wickedness\n<i>never<\/i> was happiness\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9133\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9133)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9133)\">Alma 41:10<\/a><\/span>,\nitalics added). Dishonest persons soon\ndiscover this. Not only does dishonesty ruin their lives, but it also brings shame and dishonor\nto their families. Dishonesty also brings shame and suffering to the people of the church to\nwhich they belong. Like it or not, we are all soon tarred with the same brush.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Dishonesty in little things<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt is easy to be dishonest in little things. Few people think it dishonest to take a pencil home.\nThe Church has about 3,500 employees. Figuring five cents per pencil, if each person were to\ntake one pencil, such a loss would amount to $175.00. A person who would think twice about\nstealing $175.00 may never lose a moment's sleep about taking a pencil. Yet what limits dare\none set for dishonesty? Little things soon amount to big things. Before we are aware, we\ngraduate to greater sin.\n<\/p><p>\nThe telling of a lie may appear to be a little thing, but one lie leads to another until a person's\nreputation is lost. Once a person is branded a liar, a cheat, or a thief, it takes a long period of\nrepentance and restoration to bring back a reputation so easily tarnished by a careless and\nthoughtless act. As long as we have to learn to be honest or dishonest, why not learn to be\nhonest?\n<\/p><p>\nI wish all boys could have had a mother such as I had. One day I came home eating an apple.\nMother asked me where I got it. I told her I found it. She soon discovered that I had found it\nin Mr. Goddard's grocery store, and mother insisted I take it back. I protested that it was\npartly eaten, but at her urging I took the partly eaten apple back to Mr. Goddard and\nshamefully told him I had robbed his store. He phoned mother to tell her I had brought it\nback and said he had seen me take it, but it was such a little thing he hadn't bothered to say\nanything about it. It wasn't a little thing to mother. She loved us too much to have a thief in\nthe family.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Justification through faultfinding<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThere is a phenomenon that accompanies dishonest persons. Before long they become very\ncritical and tend to find fault with leaders who call their attention to their unrighteousness.\nInstead of repenting and changing their lives for the better, they tend to justify their own\nmisdeeds by finding fault with their leaders. The Prophet Joseph Smith said: \n<\/p><p>\n\"I will give you one of the Keys of the mysteries of the Kingdom. It is an eternal principle,\nthat has existed with God from all eternity: That man who rises up to condemn others, finding\nfault with the Church, saying that they are out of the way, while he himself is righteous, then\nknow assuredly, that that man is in the high road to apostasy; and if he does not repent, will\napostatize, as God lives\" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>, Joseph Fielding Smith,\ncomp., pp. 156-57).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>In prosperity we forget God<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAnother truism is that God does bless the righteous. Often in that moment when God showers\nblessings upon us most abundantly, we forget him because we no longer need his sustaining\nhand. I hope with our present prosperity we are not forgetting our Maker nor forgetting those\npractices of honesty and integrity that have made us what we are today. Helaman, a great\nBook of Mormon prophet, wrote: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men; yea, we\ncan see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put their\ntrust in him.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his people . . . then is the time\nthat they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their\nfeet the Holy One&mdash;yea, and this because of their ease, and their exceedingly great\nprosperity.\n<\/p><p>\n\"Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride . . . and how slow are they to remember the Lord\ntheir God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom's paths!\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24708\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24708)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24708)\">Hel. 12:1-2,5<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWould it not be wise to examine our practices to see which road we are walking? Is <i>our<\/i> word\nas good as our bond? Are we honest in our dealings with others, even in little things?\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Leaders in righteousness<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nJust because we Latter-day Saints live in a current world characterized by sharp and dishonest\npractices is no excuse for us to be untrustworthy. Because others lie is no excuse for us to be\ndishonest. On the contrary, we must be leaders of righteousness so that others may know the\npaths of honesty and righteousness that lead back into the presence of God the Eternal Father.\nThe power of the priesthood is given us to lead. Those who bear that priesthood must be\npillars of honesty and virtue in every sense of the word. The apostle Peter spoke to priesthood\nleaders in this way: \n<\/p><p>\n\"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye\nshould shed forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous\nlight: \n<\/p><p>\n\"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which\nwar against the soul; \n<\/p><p>\n\"Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as\nevildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of\nvisitation\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"2327\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2327)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2327)\">1 Pet. 2:9,11-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Honoring the royal name we bear<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs the children of God, our lives must be filled with good works, honest practices, and honest\nvirtues that are characteristic of the children of God. When we take upon ourselves the name\nof Jesus Christ, we bear the responsibility of guarding that great name with our very lives.\n<\/p><p>\nTo fail to honor that royal name we bear as Christians is to hold the very God we espouse to\nopen ridicule and shame. In effect, we crucify him anew before the world.\n<\/p><p>\nNow we know these things are true. Like Amulek of old we know better, but often we won't\nlisten. As Amulek said: \n<\/p><p>\n\". . . I did harden my heart, for I was called many times and I would not hear; therefore I\nknew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling against\nGod, in the wickedness of my heart\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"9123\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 9123)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(9123)\">Alma 10:6<\/a><\/span>,\nitalics added).\n<\/p><p>\nYou know as I know that the ways of God will not fail. His purposes will be accomplished\nand he will save us from our sins if only we will not harden our hearts.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is God's work. We are God's children and must not fail him. Let us all then obey those\nteachings which we know deep down in our hearts are true. It is time to remember that Jesus\ntruly is the Christ, the living Son of the living God. He is the Redeemer and Savior of this\nworld. Of the divinity of his teachings and the rightness of his cause I bear my personal\nwitness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
