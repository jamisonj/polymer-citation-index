The Holy Ghost will often preach sermons to us from the pulpit of memory. He will comfort us and reassure us. The burdens not lifted from us, He will help us to bear, thus enabling, even after we err, to continue with joy the soul-stretching journey of discipleship. After all, while the adversary clearly desires our lasting misery, the Father and the Son truly and constantly desire our everlasting happiness (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"4681\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 4681)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(4681)\">2 Ne. 2:27<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/apply-the-atoning-blood-of-christ.p26\" class=\"\">Brothers and sisters, Christ paid such an enormous, enabling price for us! Will we not apply His Atonement in order to pay the much smaller price required for personal progress? (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"40986\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 40986)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(40986)\">Mosiah 4:2<\/a><\/span>). Being valiant in our testimony of Jesus, therefore, includes being valiant in our efforts to live more as He lived (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"20778\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 20778)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(20778)\">D&amp;C 76:79<\/a><\/span>). We certainly cannot enter His kingdom without receiving the restored ordinances and keeping their associated covenants, but neither can we enter His kingdom without having significantly developed our charity and the other cardinal attributes (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"22445\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22445)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22445)\">Ether 12:34<\/a><\/span>). Yes, we need the essential ordinances, but we also need the essential attributes. Yes, we need to keep our covenants, but we also need to develop our character. Do we not sing, \u201cMore holiness give me,\u201d pleading that we can be \u201cmore, Savior, like thee\u201d? (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> no. 131).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/11\/apply-the-atoning-blood-of-christ.p27\" class=\"\">During this special process, how can you and I better insure that the precious blessings given by God are fully received by us? For my part, I desire that my blessings, including the recent \u201cdelay en route,\u201d bring about my needed and greater spiritual refinement in addition to my grateful acknowledgment. Yes, you and I should count our blessings, but we should also make them count! Furthermore, since the focus in extremity falls on the things of eternity, such should be our focus in whatever remains of mortal brevity. This is my earnest prayer for me and for you in the holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            <\/div><!-- end #primary -->\n                        \n                        <!-- end #secondary -->\n                        \n                    <\/div><\/div>"}
