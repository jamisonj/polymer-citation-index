The introductory pages of the Book of Mormon have the great prophet Nephi, while recounting the trials and blessings of his day, first paying homage to his father: \u201cI, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-20905_000_033\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"1333\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 1333)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(1333)\">1 Ne. 1:1<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/because-my-father-sent-me.p7\" class=\"\">Enos, likewise, first recognized his father for the preparation he received: \u201cBehold, it came to pass that I, Enos, knowing my father that he was a just man\u2014for he taught me in his language, and also in the nurture and admonition of the Lord\u2014and blessed be the name of my God for it.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-20905_000_033\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21458\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21458)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21458)\">Enos 1:1<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/because-my-father-sent-me.p8\" class=\"\">When the Prophet Joseph Smith first received the vision of the angel Moroni, he was instructed to tell his father, who, in turn, confirmed that it was true and that Joseph should follow the directions of Moroni.

I remember one experience of a fine young man who spent his life on the ranch, just as his own father did. When the boy got into the mission field, it was all strange: too many people, not enough open spaces. He wanted badly to go home. Finally, the mission president had the young missionary call his father. The father listened patiently as his son said how homesick he was, and then the father spoke in terms that his son could understand, and as I heard about this, it brought a smile to my face. He said with firmness but love, \u201cSon, you\u2019re just going to have to \u2018cowboy up.\u2019\u201d The boy knew exactly what that meant, and he is hanging on as the spirit of his mission begins to come. He knows his father will not give up on him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/because-my-father-sent-me.p12\" class=\"\">Innumerable are the numbers of those young people who did not quit and go home during those first days of being away at school or away from home the first time because of the good influence of fathers and mothers.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/because-my-father-sent-me.p13\" class=\"\">When I sat across from President David O. McKay and was first called to this calling some 32 years ago, I remember that after he discussed with me what would be expected, he then charged me to serve by asking me to carry out this calling in a way that would be pleasing to my own father. That was enough of a challenge for a lifetime. President McKay knew my father, who had been a stake president for 20 years, and I looked on my father as one of the greatest men I knew. My first understanding of how important I was to my father and how real the Savior was, was when I heard him pray for us in family prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2000\/05\/because-my-father-sent-me.p14\" class=\"\">Now there are some exceptions, such as death and other serious circumstances, but what is needed today is for fathers to commit to being fathers, whatever that might take\u2014to assume the responsibility and to live by it, that you may become an anchor to all who come after you. If the example has not been set in your life, then reach out and try to help establish it, and resolve that that example will begin with you, if there is no one else.
