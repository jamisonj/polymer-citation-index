These were divinely determined in another time and another place. We are accustomed to focusing on the men of God because theirs is the priesthood and leadership line. But paralleling that authority line is a stream of righteous influence reflecting the remarkable women of God who have existed in all ages and dispensations, including our own. Greatness is not measured by coverage in column inches, either in newspapers or in the scriptures. The story of the women of God, therefore, is, for now, an untold drama within a drama.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-25911_000_041\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cThe Women of God,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> May 1978, 10.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p8\" class=\"\">Some of you sisters may feel inadequate because you can\u2019t seem to do all you want to do. Motherhood and parenting are most challenging roles. You also have Church callings that you fulfill so capably and conscientiously. In addition, many of you, besides all this, have to work as well as care for your family. My heart goes out to the widows and the single-parent sisters who bear so much of the responsibility of parenting. In general you noble sisters are doing a much better job of holding it all together and making it work than you realize. May I suggest that you take your challenges one day at a time. Do the best you can. Look at everything through the lens of eternity. If you will do this, life will take on a different perspective.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p9\" class=\"\">I believe that all of you sisters want to be happy and find the peace that the Savior promised. I think many of you try very hard to keep up with all of your responsibilities. I do not wish to offend anyone. I am reluctant to mention a matter but feel it should be said. Sometimes we carry unhappy feelings about past hurts too long. We spend too much energy dwelling on things that have passed and cannot be changed. We struggle to close the door and let go of the hurt. If, after time, we can forgive whatever may have caused the hurt, we will tap \u201cinto a life-giving source of comfort\u201d through the Atonement, and the \u201csweet peace\u201d of forgiveness will be ours.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-25911_000_041\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See \u201cMy Journey to Forgiving,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Feb. 1997, 43.]<\/span><\/sup> Some injuries are so hurtful and deep that healing comes only with help from a higher power and hope for perfect justice and restitution in the next life.

Your influence for good is incalculable and indescribable. President Brigham Young said: \u201cThe sisters in our Female Relief Societies have done great good. Can you tell the amount of good that the mothers and daughters in Israel are capable of doing? No, it is impossible. And the good they will do will follow them to all eternity.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote5-25911_000_041\">5<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> sel.

God entrusts women to bear and nurture His children. No other work is more important. Motherhood is such an important role for women. Sacred blessings and righteous influence have flowed into my own life and my family\u2019s lives from my beloved wife, her mother, my own mother, grandmothers, my precious daughters, and granddaughters. The treasured relationship of each woman in my life is beyond expression. This is especially true of my eternal companion, Ruth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p12\" class=\"\">We want you single sisters to know of our great love for you. You can be powerful instruments in the hands of God to help bring about this great work. You are valued and needed. Other women, even though married, may not be mothers. For those in either of these circumstances, please be assured that the Lord loves you and has not forgotten you. You can do something for another person that no one else ever born can do. You may be able to do something for another woman\u2019s child that she may not be able to do herself. I believe some compensatory blessings will come in this life and in the hereafter to sisters in those circumstances. These blessings and a comforting peace will come to you if you can love God \u201cwith all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-25911_000_041\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"44513\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 44513)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(44513)\">Luke 10:27<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> You can still be highly successful in whatever you do as instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p13\" class=\"\">Women affect so very much of what happens in the world for good or otherwise. In some measure, wives and mothers control the flow of blessings that come into their homes. As you sustain the priesthood callings of your husband and encourage your sons in their priesthood activities, your homes will be richly blessed. You should also urge your children to help others who are in need. Our home has been blessed because of my wife\u2019s involvement in Relief Society all of our married life. She was a ward and then a stake Relief Society president during a period of some years. As she went about her duties and attended her meetings, our home was blessed with the sweet spirit of service she brought home with her.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p14\" class=\"\">You are members, as we have heard tonight, of the greatest society for women in the world.

My wife toiled all summer in lending her aid towards its accomplishment. She had a hundred pounds of wool, which, with the assistance of a girl, she spun in order to furnish clothing for those engaged in the building of the Temple, and although she had the privilege of keeping half the quantity of wool for herself, as a recompense for her labor, she did not reserve even so much as would make her a pair of stockings; but gave it for those who were laboring at the house of the Lord. She spun and wove and got the cloth dressed, and cut and made up into garments, and gave them to those men who labored on the Temple; almost all the sisters in Kirtland labored in knitting, sewing, spinning, etc. for the purpose of forwarding the work of the Lord.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote9-25911_000_041\">9<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cHistory of Joseph Smith,\u201d <span class=\"emphasis\">Times and Seasons,<\/span> Apr. 15, 1845, 867.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p17\" class=\"\">Polly Angell, wife of the Church architect, said that the Prophet told them: \u201cWell sisters, you are always on hand.

These are gifts you use to make our lives more pleasant. Often when you sisters prepare and give a lesson you put an attractive cloth and flowers on the table, which is a wonderful expression of your caring and conscientious nature. In contrast, when the brethren give a lesson they don\u2019t even decorate the table with as much as a shriveled dandelion! Occasionally, however, you are too hard on yourselves. You think that if your offering is not quite perfect, it is not acceptable. I tell you, however, that if you have done your best, which you usually do, your humble offering, whatever it may be, will be acceptable and pleasing to the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p19\" class=\"\">In these days, visiting teachers do much good. Twelve years ago, Suzy was called to be Dora\u2019s visiting teacher. A widow with no children, Dora had a difficult personality and was almost a recluse. When Suzy first began visiting Dora, she was met at the doorstep but never invited in. Several months later, Suzy took a treat to Dora, but Dora said she could not accept it. When Suzy asked why not, she answered, \u201cBecause you\u2019ll want something in return.\u201d Suzy assured her, \u201cAll I want is your friendship.\u201d After that, visiting became easier. Gradually, Suzy found ways to do things for Dora and to listen when listening was needed. She would also tell her about the wonderful people in the ward, the lessons, and the conferences, thus making her feel a part of the ward. As Dora\u2019s health began to deteriorate, Suzy\u2019s visits were daily, and they became close friends. When Dora died, Suzy was able to eulogize the woman others called \u201cunapproachable\u201d as a \u201cremarkable woman\u201d and \u201ca cherished friend.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote11-25911_000_041\">11<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Letter in possession of Relief Society office.]<\/span><\/sup> She knew her as few others could because of her service as a visiting teacher.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/11\/instruments-in-the-hands-of-god.p20\" class=\"\">Relief Society is a sisterhood and a place where women are instructed to build their faith and to accomplish good works. As President Hinckley has often said, we all need friends. Friendship fills us with warmth and love. It is not confined to the young or the old, the rich or the poor, the little known or the public figure. Whatever our circumstances, we all need someone who will listen to us with understanding, pat us on the back when we need encouragement, and nurture in us the desire to do better and to be better.
