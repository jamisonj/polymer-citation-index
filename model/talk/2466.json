We will ever be indebted to him and thankful to him for asking us what we knew about the Mormon Church and would we like to know more. Through the missionary discussions we were thoroughly convinced that this was the true church. And the thing that has changed my life the most is that I have found a purpose in life and a certain peace of mind I have never felt before. I know with all my heart that this is the true church and that Christ lives and God lives.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p14\" class=\"\">These converts\u2019 testimonies are truly inspiring and emphasize the value of the gospel to them and to their families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p15\" class=\"\">I have borne my testimony many times to people who were interested in knowing more about the Church, and they have asked me, \u201cHow can I obtain a conviction of the truthfulness of the restored gospel\u2014yes, a testimony to this effect?\u201d My answer has been, \u201cStudy the gospel, pray and attend church.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p16\" class=\"\">This formula when followed will bring a conviction or testimony that the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is true, and when one accepts the gospel plan and lives its principles, it will bring him peace, happiness, growth, and development. However, to obtain a testimony one must have a real desire to know the truth and must be willing to exert considerable effort.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p17\" class=\"\">The interested person must study the gospel, and the gospel is to be found primarily in the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price, the four standard works of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p18\" class=\"\">In this dispensation the Lord has counseled us to \u201cseek \u2026 out of the best books words of wisdom: seek learning, even by study. \u2026\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16359\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16359)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16359)\">D&amp;C 88:118<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p19\" class=\"\">Jesus said, \u201c\u2026 know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28780\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28780)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28780)\">John 8:32<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p20\" class=\"\">I feel sure that part of this freedom Jesus refers to must be freedom from ignorance, as ignorance is a deterrent to happiness, growth, and development.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p21\" class=\"\">Through study of the scriptures we can understand our relationship to God and how the basic gospel principles apply to our daily lives. Our study, however, should be constant and intensive, for the gospel of Jesus Christ embraces all truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p22\" class=\"\">Now regarding the second step to acquire a testimony\u2014<span class=\"emphasis\">prayer<\/span>\u2014the Prophet Joseph Smith observed that \u201cit is the first principle of the gospel to know for a certainty the character of God, and to know that we may converse with Him as one man converses with another. \u2026\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Documentary History of the Church,<\/span> vol. 6, p. 305.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p23\" class=\"\">Near the end of the Book of Mormon, Moroni, a great leader, gave this promise:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"38390\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 38390)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(38390)\">Moro. 10:4\u20135<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p26\" class=\"\">Although this promise specifically refers to the Book of Mormon, I am sure as you study the Bible, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price you will find that the promise is likewise applicable to these scriptures.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p27\" class=\"\">Prayer plays a vital part in our religious thinking and in our daily lives. One of my convert friends told me, \u201cBecause the elders emphasized that we should pray, I did. I barely had asked the questions when this beautiful answer came. Yes, that was the start of my new life.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p28\" class=\"\">Another convert said, \u201cI used to pray, not often, but I did pray before we became members. I prayed that someday my husband and I would grow closer together. I never thought it would come to be, but the Church was my answer. We found the power of prayer. I\u2019m so thankful for the Church.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p29\" class=\"\">Prayer then must accompany study for one to obtain a testimony of the truthfulness of the restored gospel.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p30\" class=\"\">The third part of the formula to obtain a testimony is to attend church and become involved in church activities. My Arizona convert friend also had this to say: \u201cThe first time we visited a ward meeting, I felt such a warm, loving feeling. All the people seemed to have smiles on their faces and hearty handshakes for us. We felt so welcome, and we knew we wanted to be a part of all this. This was the only way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p31\" class=\"\">She continued: \u201cAnother aspect of the Church I love is its constant learning, developing, and growing power.

My first calling was that of chorister in sacrament meeting.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p33\" class=\"\">\u201cThen I was asked to be a Mia Maid leader. I asked the question, \u2018What is a Mia Maid?\u2019 I learned from experience. That is a girl at the delightful age of 14. The girls have so much enthusiasm and energy. I am thrilled with my calling in MIA. It keeps me feeling young and needed and busy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p34\" class=\"\">\u201cMy husband, too, has held many positions in the ward, and his determination and dedication have been a strength to me.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p35\" class=\"\">After listening to these converts\u2019 testimonies, it is easy to see why so many members of the Church declare that their testimony is their most prized possession.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p36\" class=\"\">Many thousands have received a testimony, a conviction of the truthfulness of the restored gospel, by following the formula: study, pray, and attend church. They have thus been able to better interpret the scriptures and find their place in the eternal scheme of things.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p37\" class=\"\">To those of you who feel that you have a firm testimony, remember: a testimony is never static; a testimony can be lost. To keep it alive, it must be fed. Continue to study, pray, attend church, and be involved. This will not only keep your testimony alive, but it will expand and become more meaningful in your life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p38\" class=\"\">I bear my testimony to you that the Holy Ghost has borne witness to me that God lives and is the Father of our spirits, that Jesus Christ is our Redeemer and Savior, and that Joseph Smith was a great prophet chosen by God to restore the gospel in its fullness and the power to act in his name in this dispensation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/05\/testimony.p39\" class=\"\">The Holy Ghost has also borne witness to me that President Spencer W.
