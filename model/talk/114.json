Widtsoe, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, April 1944, pp. 93-97<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brethren and fellow workers, this has been a very enjoyable conference to me, and I\nknow to all of us. A spirit of peace has been here, and that is as it should be, for the head of\nthis Church is the Prince of Peace.\n<\/p><p>\nThat which has been said during these two days has been interesting, instructive and\nimpressive. I have been built up in my testimony, as well as in my knowledge of the Gospel.\nI have felt to thank the Lord, time and again, as I have looked into the faces of you, my\nfellow workers, for the faith and devotion to truth and to the cause of the Lord, His truth,\nwhich I know abide in you.\n<\/p><p>\nACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE CHURCH REFLECT FAITH\n<\/p><p>\nI am certain all of us were, shall I say, astonished, when we heard the report of the year's\nactivities of the Church. Most of us had no idea, living in our little corners, doing our duty\nwell in them, how great is the accumulation of service the Church is rendering. The twig\nplanted by the Prophet Joseph Smith, under God's direction, on April 6, 1830, has grown into\na mighty tree, bearing bountiful and good fruit.\n<\/p><p>\nThe thing that impressed me, I think more than anything else, when the report was read, was\nthat every dollar mentioned, every can of fruit reported, represented a spiritual value, greater\nthan the dollars, better than the can itself or the fruit within it. The dollars and the cans\nreflected faith, faith in our hearts and in our actions. It reflected the nearness that the Church\nof God is building toward the Father of us all.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen I heard President Grant's eloquent, impressive address&mdash;and he gave us the spirit of the\nconference&mdash;it was evident again that this Church is built upon eternal realities. I thought as I\nheard the reading of his address of a statement frequently made in sacred writ, that \"the\ncourse of God is one eternal round\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"11967\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11967)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11967)\">D&amp;C 35:1<\/a><\/span>).\nThe Gospel does not vary nor depart from truth. In every\nage, in every dispensation, in every day and in every hour, all that we can do is to live\nrighteously before the Lord, and to make use of the eternal principles which have been\nhanded down to us from the day we lived in the heavens, and which will continue to the very\nend.\n<\/p><p>\nMy heart has been filled with gladness during this conference. I am grateful\nfor the calling into the service of Brother Mark E. Petersen, as I am for the other brethren\nwho have come into the Council of the Twelve recently, and of course for all who have\nserved longer. I have known Brother Petersen for some time. He is one of us, a faithful\nLatter-day Saint. We can trust him.\n<\/p><p>\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH\n<\/p><p>\nIn preparation for this conference, I have thought about the present perplexed and pitiful\nconditions of the world. I was led to turn back the pages of history. It is said that \"history\nrepeats itself,\" and so I thought that perhaps I might discover some solution for our\npresent-day problems by reading history.\n<\/p><p>\nI turned, as I often do, to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I came into this Church from another\nChurch, a man-made Church, one that is without the substance of truth, though filled with\ngood people, deceived in their belief. When I found in this Church the true Gospel of the\nLord Jesus Christ, I fell in love with Joseph Smith. I have been in love with him ever since.\n<\/p><p>\nSo I turned back to see if I might discover something that he had said that might help me in\nclearing my own thinking. If you are willing, let me take you back a hundred years.\n<\/p><p>\nA hundred years ago the Prophet Joseph Smith was living out the last twelve months of his\nlife on earth. It must have been a terrible year for him. Enemies, and bitterness of feeling\nsprang up on every hand against the people and leaders of the Church. Lawsuits followed\nlawsuit. There was no peace, especially for Joseph and his brother, Hyrum. It would seem, as\none reads the story of that year, that the events that transpired during those twelve months\nwere too trying to be endured by ordinary mortal man.\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, I was thrilled when I found the Prophet's own words as to how he felt in the midst\nof tribulation and persecution, when facing death, for he no doubt knew that eventually his\nenemies would destroy his life. He expressed a great calm of spirit. In the midst of the storm\nand stress of the day he was calm. There was a majesty of calmness about him as he said:\n<\/p><p>\nThe Great Jehovah has ever been with me. The wisdom of God will direct me in the seventh\nhour. I feel in closer communion and better standing with God than I ever felt before.\n<\/p><p>\nIn substance, that message has been given over and over again in this conference, for it is\nanother way of stating the results of obedience to the great eternal, everlasting truths of the\ngospel. Would we not all like to be able to say that the great Jehovah has ever been with us,\nthat the wisdom of God directs us in the seventh hour; and that we feel in closer communion\nand better standing with God than we had ever felt before?\n<\/p><p>\nAs I read that message, I began to understand how he could walk as a king, in the midst of\ncircumstances of distress and persecution which marked the last year of his\nlife, though not peculiar to that year, for he was ever persecuted, even feeling the attempts of\nthe Evil One to destroy him and his work.\n<\/p><p>\nEXPERIENCES OF THE PROPHET'S LAST YEAR\n<\/p><p>\nThe experiences of his last year came to a culmination in the great April conference of 1844.\nIt began on Saturday, the 6th of April. It continued through until Tuesday&mdash;four days. The\nweather was good, almost perfect. More people attended that conference than had ever\ngathered before at any Latter-day Saint conference.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Prophet was not feeling his best physically. He said on the first day that his lungs\ntroubled him, and the sermon, which he had promised to deliver, he would give the next day.\nOn Sunday he did give it. It is one of the most marvelous messages ever given to humanity,\nspoken by human lips.\n<\/p><p>\nThat conference was remarkable in many ways. The Prophet's mind seemed to sweep, as it\nwere, the horizons of eternity. He touched upon the things that are far beyond things of\neternity. This sermon is known in our history as the \"King Follett Sermon,\" a most\nremarkable document. I am glad that Elder Joseph Fielding Smith included it in his\n<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>\nHe taught revealing doctrines never clearly told before, since Christ, or perhaps since Adam,\nof the nature of God, our Heavenly Father, and of the destiny of man. The doctrine as there\ntaught has become incorporated into our thinking and writing, in our books and sermons,\nwithout knowing exactly when or how it was first stated.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was at that conference that the land of Zion was defined. The people who had joined the\nChurch&mdash;ordinary people like ourselves&mdash;had perhaps thought of Kirtland or Missouri, as\nMissouri, as the land of Zion. But at this conference the Prophet said that the land of Zion is\nall of America&mdash;North America and South America. As we read this account, our minds go\nback to the days soon after Christ, when Peter himself was inclined to believe that the gospel\nwas for a limited few, in a limited place, until God himself, by revelation, taught Peter that\nGod's work is for all the world and all who dwell upon it, who have dwelt upon it, and who\nshall dwell upon it (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7522\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7522)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7522)\">Acts 10:9-16,28,34-35<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt was at this conference that the Prophet&mdash;(I wonder sometimes if he foresaw that in three\nmonths he would be martyred)&mdash;bore down on the people to finish the temple, and to secure\ntheir endowments, as among the most important things for them to do.\n<\/p><p>\nAt this conference, missionary work was also stressed. Brigham Young and Hyrum Smith\nboth discoursed earnestly on missionary work.\n<\/p><p>\nAs I read the minutes of the conference, I said to myself: \"These teachings are like those of\n1944&mdash;the same subjects, objectives, and requirements, and the same obligations, and the same\neternal truths to guide us in our work.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt was in this conference that the revelation came relative to stakes. Stakes of\nZion had been organized before, but the Prophet said on this occasion:\n<\/p><p>\n\"I have received instructions from the Lord that henceforth where-ever the elders of Israel\nshall build up Churches and branches unto the Lord throughout the states, there shall be a\nstake of Zion organized.\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe mentioned specifically that in course of time stakes should be organized in New York City\nand in Boston. Part of that prediction is already fulfilled, for we have a stake in New York.\n<\/p><p>\nIt was a great conference. But, the Latter-day Saints have ever been willing to apply eternal\ntruths to everyday needs. You recall that Elder Lee said that we are a practical people. We\nbelieve that the great things of life begin here, today, and that we have the right to enjoyment\nand happiness, today, as in the great day to come.\n<\/p><p>\nSo, the Prophet, during his last year, spoke frequently upon practical matters. I have not the\ntime to discuss his views relative to the building of a commonwealth, the relationship between\nindustry, agriculture, and manufacturing. That which he said is good reading today, and might\nbe read with profit by the empire-makers of today.\n<\/p><p>\nOne thing which he said, as he looked into the future, refers to us, I believe. He said:\n<\/p><p>\n\"I prophesy, in the name of the God of Israel, anguish, and wrath, and desolation, and the\nwithdrawing of the spirit of God await this generation until they are visited with utter\ndesolation.\"\n<\/p><p>\nTHE PROPHET'S SOLUTION OF PRESENT TROUBLES\n<\/p><p>\nCan you pick up a paper today, reporting great cities destroyed, countrysides laid barren,\nwithout feeling that the Prophet spoke as a prophet? He not only looked into the next day, but\ninto the years to come, and into the ages that lie before.\n<\/p><p>\nBut in the spirit of the gospel, he set about at once to find a solution, for coming distress.\nThis is what I found. I found three principles that appeared to be a solution of the world's\ntroubles, but specifically and particularly pertaining to the United States. He was thinking\nabout the United States&mdash;they were living in the United States at that time; they had problems\nwithin the States.\n<\/p><p>\nFirst, the Prophet laid down certain foundation principles.\n<\/p><p>\n\"It is our purpose to build up and establish the principles of righteousness, and not to break\ndown or destroy.\" That had a tremendous meaning. We seek to establish righteousness&mdash;yes;\nbut we are not destroyers; we are builders. We accept all good that has come down through\nthe years.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he continues:\n<\/p><p>\n\"And I proclaim, in the name of the Lord God Almighty, that I will fellowship nothing in this\nChurch but virtue, integrity, and uprightness.\" \n<\/p><p>\nTo a man seeking for Mormonism in a nutshell, perhaps these two statements would be a\ngood offering. Upon such a platform the Prophet, in the midst of\npersecution, could be calm, unruffled, and could carry forward steadily the work of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nSecond, he declared the necessity for full conformity with the Constitution of the United\nStates. If we desire prosperity, we of this land must conform to the principles that lie\nimbedded in the Constitution of the United States. For, he said, through such conformity we\nshall win liberty of conscience, and protection for the weak and for the oppressed. Without\nthe preservation of this right and protection, there is no true freedom. The Church has ever\nfought for the untrammeled conscience. The great welfare program is but the working out of\nthe principle inherent in the Gospel; that the weak and the oppressed shall be protected. These\nprinciples embody the very spirit of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThird, he laid down a principle which comes home to us this year. Brother Kirkham barely\nmentioned it. It so happened that in 1844 there would be a presidential election the following\nfall, and the Prophet and others spoke about the problems of that election. Hyrum Smith, the\nfellow-martyr of the Prophet, delivered an impassioned sermon, giving no quarter whatever. I\nshall read a passage or two:\n<\/p><p>\nWe engage in the election, the same as any other principle; you are to vote for good men, and\nif you do not do this, it is a sin: to vote for wicked men would be a sin. Choose the good and\nrefuse the evil. Men of false principles have preyed upon us like wolves upon helpless lambs.\nDamn the rod of tyranny; curse it. Let every man use his liberties according to the\nConstitution; . . . we want a president of the United States, not a party president, but a\npresident of the whole people, for a party president disfranchises the opposite party. Have a\npresident who will maintain every man in his rights.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
