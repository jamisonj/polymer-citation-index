Many of you have only recently been baptized; your covenants are fresh in your hearts, your sacrifices still tender. As I think about you, I am reminded of Priscilla Staines from Wiltshire, England. Nineteen-year-old Priscilla joined the Church in 1843. Alone. She had to steal away in the night to be baptized, because of the persecutions of her neighbors and the displeasure of her family. She wrote: \u201cWe waited until midnight \u2026 and then repaired to a stream of water a quarter of a mile away. Here we found the water \u2026 frozen over, and the elder had to chop a hole in the ice large enough for the purpose of baptism. \u2026 None but God and his angels, and the few witnesses who stood on the bank with us, heard my covenant; but in the solemnity of that midnight hour it seemed as though all nature were listening, and the recording angel writing our words in the book of the Lord.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-22911_000_035\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Quoted in Edward W.

That is a phrase we often hear in the Church, but what does it mean? How do covenants define who we are and how we live?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/with-holiness-of-heart.p9\" class=\"\">Covenants\u2014or binding promises between us and Heavenly Father\u2014are essential for our eternal progression. Step-by-step, He tutors us to become like Him by enlisting us in His work. At baptism we covenant to love Him with all our hearts and love our sisters and brothers as ourselves. In the temple we further covenant to be obedient, selfless, faithful, honorable, charitable. We covenant to make sacrifices and consecrate all that we have. Forged through priesthood authority, our kept covenants bring blessings to fill our cups to overflowing. How often do you reflect that your covenants reach beyond mortality and connect you to the Divine? Making covenants is the expression of a willing heart; keeping covenants, the expression of a faithful heart.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/with-holiness-of-heart.p10\" class=\"\">Sounds so simple on paper, doesn\u2019t it? Of course, the doing is where we prove who we really are. Thus, every time we reach out with love, patience, kindness, generosity, we honor our covenants by saying, \u201cHere am I; send me.\u201d Usually we speak these words softly, unaccompanied by brass bands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2002\/11\/with-holiness-of-heart.p11\" class=\"\">When have someone else\u2019s covenants with the Lord blessed <span class=\"emphasis\">your<\/span> life, brought you peace, nurtured your soul?

For instance, when it comes to families, we cannot afford indifference and distraction. Childhood is a vanishing wonder; so few have had the sunny days I knew growing up on a farm.

This period of soul-searching was marked by changing jobs, new financial pressures, tugs from worldly philosophies. Now listen to what she did. She sat down with other sisters in her ward and found that they too were searching to find the peace the gospel brings. She asked for a priesthood blessing. She valiantly carried forward in her calling. She studied and tried to more fully commit her love, appreciation, and conviction to Jesus. She prayed. \u201cI cried to the Lord,\u201d she said, \u201cand told Him I would do whatever He would ask of me.\u201d She did all this despite those difficulties. And do you know what happened? No, her eternal companion did not appear on her doorstep.
