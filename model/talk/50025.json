He has stated things as they are, according to my knowledge. I have been acquainted with him some twenty-three or twenty-four years. He is our Judge in this county, and I can say to his praise that he is one of the best Judges we have in the Territory; and my prayer and wish to God is that we may not have a swore Judge from this time henceforth and forever, and that we may never have any Judges in this Territory but men of our own choice, and that we may never have any person to preside over us in the capacity of a Governor of this Territory but the man of our own choice.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"94494\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 94494)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(94494)\">Jer. 30:21<\/a><\/span> [Voices: &#x201C;Amen.&#x201D;] And I can say further, we never will.

Here, in the Territory of Deseret, is the kingdom of God, and here are all the officers pertaining to that kingdom; and here is an organization that is organized after the order of God, and it is organized after the order of the Church of the Firstborn. <\/div> <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"129b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD05\/JoD05_0129.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;129b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/2247\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n896\"> Let me explain what the Church of the Firstborn is. It is the first Church that ever was raised up upon this earth; that is, the first born Church. That is what I mean; and when God our Father organized that Church, He organized it just as His Father organized the Church on the earth where He dwelt; and that same order is organized here in the City of Great Salt Lake; and it is that order that Joseph Smith the Prophet of God organized in the beginning in Kirtland, Ohio. Brother Brigham Young, myself, and others were present when that was done; and when those officers received their endowments, they were together in one place. They were organized, and received their endowments and blessings, and those keys were placed upon them, and that kingdom will stand forever. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n897\"> Now mark it&#x2014;that kingdom will never be overthrown;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"61174\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 61174)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(61174)\">Dan. 2:44<\/a><\/span> although they may kill, that is, if they can, brother Brigham and me, and brother Daniel H.

They are now designing to come with troops to break us up and to kill our Prophets, and our Apostles, and our Elders. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n901\"> Brethren, I will tell you one thing, and you may be sure of it, as the Lord God lives, and as my soul lives, that nations that raise the weapons of war against this people shall perish by those weapons.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"59726\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 59726)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(59726)\">Isa. 54:17<\/a><\/span> [Voices: &#x201C;Amen.&#x201D;] Every nation, every tongue, and every people shall perish, and every man and woman that gives consent to it.

Brother Elias has been talking about that this morning, how he has felt that will that was in him. Gentlemen, he has not been easy to handle and place upon the wheel; if he had been, he would have been filled with almighty power, even the power that was upon Joseph and Brigham, and upon every other good man in this Church; but he is going to walk up henceforth; he ain't going to stand back any more. He is akin to brother Joseph, and Joseph is ashamed of his own kindred that will not step forth and be valiant, and God is ashamed of them. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n909\"> Be passive in the hands of God, in the hands of His servants, as clay in the hands of the potter.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"60524\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 60524)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(60524)\">Jer. 18:6<\/a><\/span> How is that?

It is not the fault of the blacksmith. &#x201C;But,&#x201D; says the iron, &#x201C;don't you handle me in this manner.&#x201D; He throws that aside: that has got to go back to the furnace again, to be melted and made into a loop, and that turned out into iron again, because it was not passive; and then it becomes passive by getting the snappish stuff out of it: it runs out with the dross. The dross, you know, is very brittle and snappish. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n913\"> When you find a man or woman snappish and fretful, and not willing to be subject, you may know there is a good deal of dross in that character, because dross is brittle.

We came here to the Valleys of the Mountains, and you have followed us. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n916\"> Let me tell you, gentlemen, you have got to learn to be passive and be like clay in the hands of the potter,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"60525\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 60525)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(60525)\">Jer. 18:6<\/a><\/span> or be like a tallowed rag or wick before a hot fire: it becomes limber and passive, and you can tie it into a thousand knots, and it will not break. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n917\"> Are you of that nature that you will not break and fly as though there were a hundred convulsions in you? You have got to come to that standard, as true as you ever become the true subjects and heirs of the kingdom of God. And let brother Brigham take a hundred men of that character, and I would give more for them than ten thousand people who are stiff in their own way; and he would take that hundred men and go into the mountains and whip out the world. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n918\"> We read that one shall chase a thousand, and two shall put ten thousand to flight.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"55235\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55235)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55235)\">Deut. 32:30<\/a><\/span> We read that in the Bible.

Would they come any quicker if we told them that they were poor, miserable, priest-ridden curses, who want a President in the chair that dare not speak for fear those hellhounds be on him? <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n923\"> God knew that Zachary Taylor would strike against us, and He sent him to hell.

They would make our Father and God a drudge&#x2014;make him do the dirty work, kill those poor devils, and every poor, rotten-hearted curse in our midst. With them it is, &#x201C;O Lord, kill them, kill them, damn them, kill them, Lord.&#x201D; It is just like that, and their course has just as much nonsense in it. We intend to kill the poor curses ourselves, before they get to the Big Mountain. And we are going to dig a cache, or take some natural one, and put all the whining men and women into it, and let them whine. We want to be released from such poor hellions, and we will be; we won't have a murmurer or complainer in the House of Israel. If we go out to war, let them stay here, and let the Devil handle them. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n952\"> How long is it, brother Brigham, since we first went to Kirtland? [Brother Brigham: Twenty-four years, this fall.] In September, 1833, we went to Kirtland and gathered with Joseph and the Saints.

They are trying to take the lives of brother Brigham and your leaders. It is their design, and the design of the President of the United States, with his cabinet, and of Congress; and all the priests there are in the world back them up. That is the truth. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n954\"> Get the Spirit of the Lord, and stop your whining, every one of you. &#x201C;Oh,&#x201D; says one, &#x201C;I will leave you, if you don't wait on me as you have hitherto, and get me all the things I ask for.&#x201D; I wish you would: you could not please me better. Does that show such whiners have got integrity in them? A man or woman that has got integrity should have it, if there is nothing but a potato to eat. And if you have not a stocking to your feet, nor a gown, nor a petticoat, nor a short gown, you should be as true as the sun to the servants of the living God; and if you are not so under such circumstances, you would not be if you were loaded down with treasures. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n955\"> It is true, I will tell you, the day of your being petted is past; and you have got to come to the crisis when the gate will be shut down between us and the United States, and that very soon, ladies and gentlemen; and if you don't get your test, you may say I am false.

No, never; and we never had anything except we worked for it and go it by the hardest licks; and our wives would think that they were very extravagant to get a piece of calico of six yards for a dress pattern; and they thought that there were too many puckers then: and now you have got to have six or eight breadths puckered up. Why don't you take some of those breadths out and make aprons, and not call on your husbands for new calico, &amp;c., every week. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n958\"> No man on the earth loves women better than I do. I love a good woman, one that has a good spirit; I love that woman that will strive to make me happy, and I love that son that seeks to please his father and mother; for he will make a good husband. I love that daughter that seeks to please her father and mother, because she will make a good wife. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n959\"> You cannot help yourselves; the gate will be shut down directly, ladies. I am talking to you because it is customary in the States to address the ladies first; so, if you get it first, you must not be jealous of me. I respect our ladies; and there should not be a lady in the house of Israel but what should be like an angel to administer to her husband, and to pray for him, and to nourish him by night and by day, and watch his house and his pillow, and see that he is preserved in the last days. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n960\"> We have got to go to work and manufacture our own clothing, our shoes, our stockings, our bonnets, our dresses, and everything we need. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n961\"> I will refer you to brother Brigham's words.

Why do you not do it? Tell about listening to brother Brigham! You look today as though you were listening to his counsel. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n963\"> Many of the sisters presume to judge us. Say they, There is brother Kimball; his women have all got store bonnets, and ribbons, and laces, and this, that, and the other thing, brooches, jewelry, and feather beds sowed under their arms. Ain't we just as good as they? Yes, if you do as well as they do. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n964\"> I won't say anything about anybody else's family, only my own. Are you listening to brother Brigham's counsel? Some of you say, I am willing to listen to him. Well, listen to him, and listen to him forever. I am under the necessity of laying out of my substance, and every dime I have got, and that I can get, that I would lay up for a little sugar, a little of this, and a little of that, that we actually need, a little butter and lard, that we grow in our midst; but instead of that, I have to pay every dime I can get for morocco shoes, for my women to wear to meeting; and they will wear out a pair while once going to meeting. [Voice: &#x201C;Don't you wish they earned them themselves?&#x201D;] Yes, I pray that you may have to earn them with your own fingers, or go without them. I pray that prayer, and I know it will come to pass. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n965\"> I am defending brother Brigham here, and that by the Holy Ghost and the dictation of the counsel he received from the Father, and the Son, and the old Patriarchs, and Prophets. You may go home, and say, Brother Kimball is hard. Go and say it as quick as you please. I ask no odds of any such people. I am independent of you; I know his feelings, I will preach his word, and the word of God that came through him; and that is all that will save you. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n966\"> Do you want such things to cease? <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"137b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD05\/JoD05_0137.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;137b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/2239\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> I just know it ain't right.

Why don't you put them away? I want you to make an ox goad with a spike in the end of it, and ram that into your horse, and get this instead of spurs, and destroy a horse at once. I cannot keep a decent horse, neither can brother Brigham, or any other man; for the boys will kill them. Let them rest: they are as good as we are in their sphere of action; they honor their calling, and we do not, when we abuse them: they have the same life in them that you have, and we should not hurt them. It hurts them to whip them, as bad as it does you; and when they are drawing as though their daylights would fly out of them, you must whip, whip, whip. Is there religion in that? No; it is an abuse of God's creation that he has created for us. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v5n968\"> I do not think that many ever suppose that animals are going to be resurrected.
