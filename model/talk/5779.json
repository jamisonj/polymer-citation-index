He watched each person swing and then gave suggestions. When he came to me, he said: \u2018Basically, you\u2019ve got a very good swing. Now this time, when you swing back, extend a little further to the right and explode through. Good,\u2019 he said. \u2018Practice that way. And if anyone ever tries to tell you differently, you tell them that I said you have a great swing!\u2019 Then he moved on to the next golfer, and I kept practicing.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/listening-with-new-ears.p8\" class=\"\">\u201cDid it work?\u201d we asked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/listening-with-new-ears.p9\" class=\"\">\u201cNot yet, but it will,\u201d he answered confidently.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/listening-with-new-ears.p10\" class=\"\">As the boys went on through the room and out the other door to do a little more practicing in the backyard, I felt a twinge of envy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/listening-with-new-ears.p11\" class=\"\">Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if there were someone whom I trusted that much\u2014an expert who could take a look at my life and say: \u201cBasically, you\u2019re doing great.

No, I want my information from a real expert.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/listening-with-new-ears.p13\" class=\"\">All at once, the light turned on! General conference! No wonder I look forward to those meetings and messages! Here are my experts: the prophets who reassure me that basically my swing is good and then give instructions about what I should do or should stop doing that will make a big difference. Not only are these men experienced, but their instructions come directly from Heavenly Father to me by way of the Holy Ghost\u2014personalized to my exact, immediate, and individual needs. Who could be trusted more than this combination: the Lord, his mouthpiece, and the Holy Ghost?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/listening-with-new-ears.p14\" class=\"\">What an exciting process! As a Young Women general presidency, we desire to invite every young woman and leader to listen to President Hinckley and find a personal message. Then we invite you to put that message into action and experience the positive changes that will surely follow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/listening-with-new-ears.p15\" class=\"\">A young woman wrote: \u201cPresident Hinckley quoted Joshua 1:9 [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30142\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30142)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30142)\">Josh. 1:9<\/a><\/span>] in one of his talks. It says, \u2018Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.\u2019 Sometimes my friends want me to be someone else and I don\u2019t want to be someone else. I want to be myself, and what I am afraid of is that I might lose them, and I don\u2019t want to lose them. When the prophet read this scripture, it was like he knew what I was feeling. I felt like somebody had answered my prayers. Whenever friend troubles happen to me again, I know what to do and think, because I have those words in my mind that I will never forget, never!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n      <p class=\"preamble\">Let me review the invitation:<\/p>\n      <ol class=\"number\"><li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">1.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Listen to and read the words of President Hinckley. It\u2019s easy to say: \u201cThat was a really good talk. He\u2019s one of my favorite speakers.\u201d Then we go home and continue to be the same people with the same problems. President Hinckley will conclude this meeting tonight. He and the other General Authorities will speak to us next weekend. Listen with new ears. Read and reread the messages. Is the Lord using his prophets to answer your prayers? Is the Lord using his prophets to send you a message that you are loved and are on the right road\u2014that fundamentally your swing is great? Is the Lord using his prophets to give you some instructions to practice or warnings to act on?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">2.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Next, identify, with the help of the Holy Ghost, a personal message\u2014the little corrections you should make in your swing. Like the young woman whose letter I have just read, there will be an idea or a few words that you will feel are spoken just for you. Their interpretation will be yours alone. This is the process of personal revelation. It is simple. Don\u2019t brush it aside.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">3.<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Put the message into action.

This is the whole point of revelation.

Her personal message was to be a missionary by being a better example to her friends. At first she found this difficult to do, but she didn\u2019t give up. Finally, she changed her habits successfully.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/listening-with-new-ears.p21\" class=\"\">She writes: \u201cWe got out of school early and all went to a friend\u2019s house to watch a video. They wanted to watch one that was rated R and they said it wasn\u2019t that bad. I was going to go along with it because I was sick of being the one to always be good. Luckily, one of the guys spoke up against it, refusing to watch it. I felt an overwhelming relief. But then they watched a PG-13 movie that was probably just as bad. I tried my hardest to talk them out of it, but couldn\u2019t. I should have gone home, but didn\u2019t. I regret it. That night in my prayers I promised the Lord to be a better example to my friends. Since then I\u2019ve cut some words out of my speech. I\u2019ve quit sluffing [skipping school], and some of my friends have stopped now too. I suggest better movies, and every time they choose something I\u2019d rather not see, I leave.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/05\/listening-with-new-ears.p22\" class=\"\">Don\u2019t be discouraged\u2014keep trying until you succeed.
