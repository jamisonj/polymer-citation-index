As one little person put it to me just the other day, \u201cWhy do you have to be so churchy?\u201d I would like to share a feeling or two concerning that inquiry. It is because, young people, we love you, are concerned about you, your well-being, and your ultimate welfare. It is important to know that we as parents have taken upon ourselves a very sacred oath and covenant to bring you up in the ways of the Lord, and that is very, very important to us, as it is to him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p17\" class=\"\">One of the scriptures many of your moms and dads take literally is the one recorded in the sixty-eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which says: \u201cAnd again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15753\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15753)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15753)\">D&amp;C 68:25<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p18\" class=\"\">Now that is rather serious to those of us who sit in such a responsible position. I once asked my mother, \u201cHow does it feel, Mom, to have all my sins placed upon your head?\u201d She said, \u201cOh, but you forgot one thing, Paul. I have transferred them back to you because I have taught you the doctrines of the kingdom.\u201d In a sense that is what we are trying to do, young people: to prepare you to live a happy and full life both now and in the future, and true joy and happiness comes in knowing and living the commandments of our Father in heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p19\" class=\"\">Would you listen to the words of Alma, that great Book of Mormon prophet.

She said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cI had the meanest mother in the whole world. While other kids had no breakfast, I had to have cereal, eggs, and toast. When others had pop and candy for lunch, I had to eat a sandwich. My mother insisted on knowing where we were at all times. You\u2019d think we were on a chain gang. She had to know who our friends were and what we were doing. She insisted that if we said we\u2019d be gone for an hour, that we would be gone for one hour or less.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cI am ashamed to admit it, but she actually had the nerve to break the child labor law. She made us wash the dishes, make beds, learn to cook, and all sorts of cruel things. I believe she lay awake nights thinking up mean things for us to do. She always insisted that we tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cBy the time we were teenagers she was much wiser, and our lives became even more miserable. None of this tooting the horn of a car for us to come running. She embarrassed us to no end by making our dates and friends come to the door to get us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p25\" class=\"\">\u201cMy mother was a complete failure as a mother. None of us have ever been arrested or beaten a rap. Each of my brothers has served a mission, and his country. And whom do we have to blame for this terrible way we turned out? You\u2019re right\u2014our mean mother. Look at all the things we have missed. We never got to take part in a riot, burn draft cards, and a million and one other things that our friends did. She made us grow up into educated, honest adults. Using this as a background, I am trying to raise my children. I stand a little taller and I am filled with pride when my children call me mean. You see, I thank God that he gave me the meanest mother in the whole world.\u201d (Orien Fifer, <span class=\"emphasis\">Phoenix Gazette<\/span>)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p26\" class=\"\">How truly blessed is a person who has a mother who cared. I too am grateful for my parents, who applied the gospel of love in such a wonderful way. And although I often remind my mother of our round-table discussions, in which she chased me around the table, I learned the truths of the gospel by example from her and from my father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p27\" class=\"\">As with the bud, so with the blossom. A boy is the only thing known from which a man can be made. I hope that we as parents are teaching our children that they are the sons and daughters of God, and that they have the capacity to become like him. It was the old Edinburgh weaver who prayed, \u201cO God, help me to hold a high opinion of myself.\u201d Likewise I would counsel young people to hold a high opinion of themselves, to remember who they really are, and to put their faith in their Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p28\" class=\"\">In today\u2019s fast-moving, materialistic world, unfortunately many fathers place their business affairs ahead of their children. I am appalled as I look around me, as was Eddie Cantor some years ago, when he said that a man will spend a whole week figuring out what stocks to buy with $1,000\u2014but he won\u2019t spend an hour with his child, in whom he has a greater investment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p29\" class=\"\">Is it any wonder that many of our young people are troubled with identity problems? We who are older speak of building a better world, but our progress is slow. Real generosity to the future lies, then, in giving all that we have to the present.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p30\" class=\"\">Now, you young people, listen to the counsel of your parents.

I would also remind you that the Lord has not left you or them unattended in our challenging world. Since the beginning of time the Lord has revealed his mind and will and has counseled us through his prophets on how to find true happiness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p32\" class=\"\">For just a moment, I would like to invite you to come with me into the scriptures, wherein you might become a little more excited about the gospel as it is related to us by great prophets. And I would hope that on your own and in family home evening, church study classes, you could become more excited about our wonderful scriptures. We tend to support and want to do those things we understand. For instance:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p33\" class=\"\">Not long ago when I was residing in Southern California, I made a trip from our home in Downey to the University of Southern California, where I was working. One morning as I traveled down a street in order to find a new route to work, I took a road where a beautiful house was under construction, and it caught my eye because it was quite similar to one my wife hoped we would build one day, although it was somewhat out of our financial reach. I took great personal interest in this house because of its familiar floor plan and style, but I noticed several weeks later that the workmen had ceased their labor, and I wondered about it. I thought for a minute maybe there was a strike, or perhaps they had run short of finances, and other possibilities entered my mind. Several months came and went, and that once shiny new lumber seemed to deteriorate. The wood gradually changed to yellow, then brown, and finally commenced to rot.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p34\" class=\"\">As I viewed this scene, young people, and this is so typical of the scriptures, I thought of the great truths that our Savior taught in the New Testament, and my mind was immediately attracted by that house to the fourteenth chapter of Luke. Now if you can, picture in your mind for a moment the Savior teaching the Pharisees and Sadducees, some sinners, publicans, and others who even sought his life. They had asked questions and he turned and made this observation. He said, \u201cFor which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost [Can you see why I had caught the message of the unfinished house?], whether he have sufficient to finish it?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p35\" class=\"\">\u201cLest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p36\" class=\"\">\u201cSaying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p37\" class=\"\">\u201cOr what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p38\" class=\"\">\u201cOr else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"31820\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 31820)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(31820)\">Luke 14:28\u201332<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1971\/06\/young-people-learn-wisdom-in-thy-youth.p39\" class=\"\">Could I just translate that scripture into 1971 language for you young people?

The cost of a wonderful home, the cost of getting an education, the cost of properly marrying, the cost perhaps in many cases of a wonderful mission, the cost of doing the right thing for the right reason. That is what our Heavenly Father would have us tell you. It is a timeless message.
