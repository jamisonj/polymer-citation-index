I realize how difficult it is in this day for young men and young women to overcome the evils of the world, to honor the priesthood, and appreciate their membership in the church of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p6\" class=\"\">There are some who are having problems, and to them I appeal in the name of the Lord to repent and walk uprightly, to keep themselves free from sin, and prepare themselves to enjoy the blessings of the faithful. You have been chosen and permitted to come forth in this day. Our priesthood is very important, and our task is enormous. Nothing will bring greater joy and success than to live according to the teachings of the gospel. Be an example; be an influence for good; be prepared and worthy to accept any call that comes from the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p7\" class=\"\">Every one of us has been foreordained for some work as His chosen servant on whom he has seen fit to confer the priesthood and power to act in his name.

The future progress of the Church, and, in fact, the future of the world, depends on how we magnify the office which we hold in the priesthood. Every deacon, every teacher, every priest, every holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood has an individual responsibility and privilege to combine forces with the Savior in being tools in his hands and helping him to accomplish his work and his glory, which is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. No other people have this same authority or special call.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p11\" class=\"\">It is hard to imagine and impossible to calculate the tremendous influence we would have if every one of us would honor his priesthood, and magnify his calling, and really try every day and in every way to use his influence to meet the onslaught of Satan. Too many of us seem to take the priesthood which we hold for granted; we fail to realize what the Lord expects of us, or we don\u2019t have the conviction, courage, and fortitude to stand up for the right and be counted, to be different when necessary.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p12\" class=\"\">One young boy on the school ground can wield a mighty influence for good. One young man on the football team, or the campus, or among his fellow workers can, by living the gospel, honoring his priesthood, and taking a stand for the right, do untold good. Often you will experience much criticism and ridicule even by those who believe as you do, even though they may respect you for doing right. But remember that the Savior himself was tormented, ridiculed, spat upon, and finally crucified because he would not waver in his conviction. Have you ever stopped to think what would have happened had he weakened and said, \u201cOh, what\u2019s the use?\u201d and abandoned his mission? Do we want to be quitters, or do we want to be valiant servants in spite of all the opposition and evil in the world?

How sad it is to see one who would rather be popular than do what he knows is right. I have in mind and remember so well a good member of the Church who was elected to the legislature but who wanted to be a good fellow, popular with everyone. He, wanting to be popular, let down his standards and took one drink at a social and then another. It happened again and again. He began drinking with the fellows at lunch and at dinner. And then, unintentionally I am sure, and contrary to his greatest desire, he became an alcoholic and lost the support of his constituency and the respect of his friends and family who loved him and sorrowed for him. He died an early death as an alcoholic. What a sad situation\u2014all because he sought the praise of men more than the praise of God.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p28\" class=\"\">This is not a single case.

One of the General Authorities, whom I will call George, was telling an experience he had when a priest. A friend of his was taking his girl home from a party, and her younger sister was going with them. He asked George to accompany them. George accepted. He said that shortly after they arrived home and were sitting in the living room together, the girl whom he took home went over, turned off the lights, came back and sat on his lap, and started to make advances. He said that though he knew he would be unpopular and even offensive, he excused himself, got up, and went home. As he was telling the story, he said that he knew that many young men today would consider him a sissy, but he remembered so well the story of Joseph who was sold into Egypt.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p33\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p34\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd she [Potiphar\u2019s wife] caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23890\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23890)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23890)\">Gen. 39:11\u201312<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p35\" class=\"\">We remember how he was made to suffer for this but how the Lord blessed him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p36\" class=\"\">Then George said: \u201cI shudder to think what might have happened if I had stayed with her and have concluded many times that I might never have been here as a servant of the Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p37\" class=\"\">As I told this story to a young man one day, his response was, \u201cThat action surely took guts, didn\u2019t it!\u201d I have thought since how true it is that to do right under similar circumstances does take guts or backbone or willpower, while to succumb shows weakness.

Young men and some adults have trials or tests of this nature. There are different kinds of temptations where their loyalty and strength of character are really tested. If we will always remember who we are and that God is watching over us, we will be able to shun, or avoid and withstand such temptations. Always remember that you cannot play with fire without danger of being burned.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p39\" class=\"\">Though it is important that we make a living for our families, and as good citizens participate in community affairs, we must not become so involved in the things of the world that we forget or neglect our duty and responsibility as called and chosen children of God and holders of his priesthood. Unless we are continually on guard we will find ourselves gradually off the straight and narrow path until we have completely gone astray, becoming a great disappointment to ourselves, our families, and the Lord, and certainly not what we had anticipated or intended or wanted to be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p40\" class=\"\">We find examples of this so often where a person, forgetting who he is, wants to be popular with his peers and wants their praise. So often athletes get so carried away with their success and desire for praise that they forget their duty to God and the importance of his approval and as a result lose their way. This applies equally to politicians, members of fraternal organizations, professions, and business. This craving for praise and popularity too often controls actions, and as they succumb they find themselves bending their character when they think they are only taking a bow.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p41\" class=\"\">Someone said to me the other day when we were talking about this that those who constantly love the praise of men more than the praise of God are faint reflections of another\u2014meaning Satan, of course\u2014who in the preexistence wanted to save all mankind, but with one condition attached\u2014that the honor and glory go to him, not to God. He was more concerned with credit than with results; glory and praise were the end in themselves. My friend went on to say that on the crucial issues, if individuals are more concerned with pleasing men than pleasing God, then they suffer from the same virus Satan had, for there are many situations where seeking the praise of men will clearly result in their hurting, not helping, mankind for they will do expedient and temporary things instead of those which are lasting and beneficial.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p42\" class=\"\">How much more satisfying it is when we receive the praise of God, knowing that it is fully justified and that his love and respect for us will persist, when usually the praise of men is fleeting and most disappointing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p43\" class=\"\">It is shocking and appalling indeed to those who believe in the teachings of Christ to see how people in high places, in order to enjoy the praise of those who are so vocal in encouraging and promoting immorality, do not take a stand against these evils and promote the teachings of Christ which are so clearly stated in these words in the Ten Commandments: \u201cThou shalt not commit adultery.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"22862\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22862)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22862)\">Ex. 20:14<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p44\" class=\"\">And then in 1 Corinthians we read:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1975\/11\/for-they-loved-the-praise-of-men-more-than-the-praise-of-god.p45\" class=\"\">\u201cKnow ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
