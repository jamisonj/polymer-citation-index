Out of that vicious and ugly attack we are plunged into a state of war. It is the first war of the 21st century. The last century has been described as the most war-torn in human history. Now we are off on another dangerous undertaking, the unfolding of which and the end thereof we do not know. For the first time since we became a nation, the United States has been seriously attacked on its mainland soil. But this was not an attack on the United States alone. It was an attack on men and nations of goodwill everywhere. It was well planned, boldly executed, and the results were disastrous. It is estimated that more than 5,000 innocent people died. Among these were many from other nations. It was cruel and cunning, an act of consummate evil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-times-in-which-we-live.p7\" class=\"\">Recently, in company with a few national religious leaders, I was invited to the White House to meet with the president. In talking to us he was frank and straightforward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-times-in-which-we-live.p8\" class=\"\">That same evening he spoke to the Congress and the nation in unmistakable language concerning the resolve of America and its friends to hunt down the terrorists who were responsible for the planning of this terrible thing and any who harbored such.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-times-in-which-we-live.p9\" class=\"\">Now we are at war. Great forces have been mobilized and will continue to be. Political alliances are being forged. We do not know how long this conflict will last. We do not know what it will cost in lives and treasure. We do not know the manner in which it will be carried out. It could impact the work of the Church in various ways.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-times-in-which-we-live.p10\" class=\"\">Our national economy has been made to suffer. It was already in trouble, and this has compounded the problem. Many are losing their employment. Among our own people, this could affect welfare needs and also the tithing of the Church. It could affect our missionary program.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-times-in-which-we-live.p11\" class=\"\">We are now a global organization. We have members in more than 150 nations.

The terrible forces of evil must be confronted and held accountable for their actions. This is not a matter of Christian against Muslim. I am pleased that food is being dropped to the hungry people of a targeted nation. We value our Muslim neighbors across the world and hope that those who live by the tenets of their faith will not suffer. I ask particularly that our own people do not become a party in any way to the persecution of the innocent. Rather, let us be friendly and helpful, protective and supportive. It is the terrorist organizations that must be ferreted out and brought down.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-times-in-which-we-live.p13\" class=\"\">We of this Church know something of such groups. The Book of Mormon speaks of the Gadianton robbers, a vicious, oath-bound, and secret organization bent on evil and destruction. In their day they did all in their power, by whatever means available, to bring down the Church, to woo the people with sophistry, and to take control of the society. We see the same thing in the present situation.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-times-in-which-we-live.p14\" class=\"\">We are people of peace. We are followers of the Christ who was and is the Prince of Peace. But there are times when we must stand up for right and decency, for freedom and civilization, just as Moroni rallied his people in his day to the defense of their wives, their children, and the cause of liberty (see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"8691\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8691)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8691)\">Alma 48:10<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-times-in-which-we-live.p15\" class=\"\">On the Larry King television broadcast the other night, I was asked what I think of those who, in the name of their religion, carry out such infamous activities. I replied, \u201cReligion offers no shield for wickedness, for evil, for those kinds of things. The God in whom I believe does not foster this kind of action. He is a God of mercy. He is a God of love. He is a God of peace and reassurance, and I look to Him in times such as this as a comfort and a source of strength.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-times-in-which-we-live.p16\" class=\"\">Members of the Church in this and other nations are now involved with many others in a great international undertaking. On television we see those of the military leaving their loved ones, knowing not whether they will return. It is affecting the homes of our people. Unitedly, as a Church, we must get on our knees and invoke the powers of the Almighty in behalf of those who will carry the burdens of this campaign.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-times-in-which-we-live.p17\" class=\"\">No one knows how long it will last. No one knows precisely where it will be fought. No one knows what it may entail before it is over.

The economy is particularly vulnerable. We have been counseled again and again concerning self-reliance, concerning debt, concerning thrift. So many of our people are heavily in debt for things that are not entirely necessary. When I was a young man, my father counseled me to build a modest home, sufficient for the needs of my family, and make it beautiful and attractive and pleasant and secure. He counseled me to pay off the mortgage as quickly as I could so that, come what may, there would be a roof over the heads of my wife and children. I was reared on that kind of doctrine. I urge you as members of this Church to get free of debt where possible and to have a little laid aside against a rainy day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-times-in-which-we-live.p19\" class=\"\">We cannot provide against every contingency.

But let us not panic nor go to extremes. Let us be prudent in every respect. And, above all, my brothers and sisters, let us move forward with faith in the Living God and His Beloved Son.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/11\/the-times-in-which-we-live.p21\" class=\"\">Great are the promises concerning this land of America.
