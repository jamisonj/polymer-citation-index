I pray that we may be obedient to his inspired leadership and follow his example. May his remarkable ministry be extended for many years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2001\/05\/them-that-honour-me-i-will-honour.p44\" class=\"\">Brethren, I have been privileged, as boy and man, to enjoy the warm, comforting spiritual mantle of the holy priesthood for 68 years. I cannot express in words what a great and marvelous sustaining influence this has been to me and my family. Many times I have been less than I should have been. But in my weak way I have wanted to be deserving of this supernal blessing. So long as there is breath in my life, I want to be found testifying of the wonder and glory of the restored gospel with its priesthood keys and authority. May we be worthy of the Lord\u2019s promise, \u201cThem that honour me I will honour,\u201d in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n\t\t\n                            \n                            \n                            <div id=\"references\" style=\"display:block;\">\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        <ol><h3 class=\"title\">Notes<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-21905_000_021\"><a name=\"-21905_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote1-21905_000_021\">1.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"2471\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 2471)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(2471)\">1 Sam. 2:30<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-21905_000_021\"><a name=\"-21905_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote2-21905_000_021\">2.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"10567\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 10567)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(10567)\">Dan. 5:23<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-21905_000_021\"><a name=\"-21905_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote3-21905_000_021\">3.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"26986\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 26986)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(26986)\">John 21:1\u201315<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-21905_000_021\"><a name=\"-21905_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote4-21905_000_021\">4.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"22475\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22475)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22475)\">Ex. 20:3<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-21905_000_021\"><a name=\"-21905_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote5-21905_000_021\">5.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"32936\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32936)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32936)\">Mark 12:30<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-21905_000_021\"><a name=\"-21905_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote6-21905_000_021\">6.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"22477\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22477)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22477)\">Ex. 20:7<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-21905_000_021\"><a name=\"-21905_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote7-21905_000_021\">7.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"11194\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 11194)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(11194)\">D&amp;C 107:4<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-21905_000_021\"><a name=\"-21905_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote8-21905_000_021\">8.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"citation\" id=\"22476\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 22476)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(22476)\">Ex. 20:3<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-21905_000_021\"><a name=\"-21905_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote9-21905_000_021\">9.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Quoted in Burton Stevenson, ed., <span class=\"emphasis\">The Home Book of Quotations<\/span> (1934), 1350.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t<li class=\"footnote \" id=\"-21905_000_021\"><a name=\"-21905_000_021\">\u00a0<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"label\">\n\t<a name=\"footnote10-21905_000_021\">10.<\/a>\n      <\/span>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Lucile C.
