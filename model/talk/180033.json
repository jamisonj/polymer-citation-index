Would they have continued, as many have done, for over forty years in this Church; and would the people, numbering in this Territory about one hundred and fifty thousand, have gathered as they have done from nearly all the civilized nations, to the great interior of this continent, if the promises made them through this Gospel had not been fulfilled.

Do you not therefore see that it would be impossible to gather such people together from the different nations? But, when the promises are realized, the people receiving something they never before experienced, when those effects are strictly in accordance with the words of God, then they have a testimony that cannot be denied. But says one, &#x201C;We hear people belonging to the different Christian sects and denominations say that they receive the spirit of God; you say the same. How are we to judge between you and them?&#x201D; I would answer in the language of the Apostle John, who, in the first verse of the fourth chapter of his General Epistle said, &#x201C;Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"78743\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 78743)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(78743)\">1 Jn. 4:1<\/a><\/span> The true spirit imparts signs to all believers. Do the Methodists, the Baptists, the Presbyterians, or any of the Christian sects receive a spirit of this kind? Do they lay their hands on the sick, and are the sick healed? If they do then they are true believers; but if they do not, it shows that they have been deceived. Do they even profess to have these signs? No. Why? Because they know they are not in possession of them; and in order to excuse themselves with a view of making everybody believe they are true believers, they say these signs were only to follow the servants of God in the first age of Christianity. Let us examine carefully the written word, to see whether this is so or not. Jesus, as is shown in the 16th chapter of St. Mark, commencing at the 15th verse, said to the Eleven Apostles, &#x201C;Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.

And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them: they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"66841\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 66841)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(66841)\">Mark 16:15-18<\/a><\/span> Were the believers here referred to confined to certain individuals?

Some argue that when the Gospel was first introduced, it was necessary that these signs should follow the believers, in order that all the world might be convinced of its divinity; but that when the Gospel had been fully established, by signs and wonders, they were no longer needed. This is believed in and accepted as truth by the great majority of the Christian world. This being the case, I have often wondered why there were not more infidels in the world, than we have a knowledge of. Because a man inclined to infidelity might say, &#x201C;If you do not believe in one part of the Gospel, what use is there in my believing any of it? If you can take upon yourselves the right to do away with a part of the Gospel, why may not I do away with the whole of it?&#x201D; The signs which the Savior promised should follow believers are just as much a part of the Gospel as salvation itself is. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n883\"> But how shall we &#x201C;try the spirits?&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"78744\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 78744)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(78744)\">1 Jn. 4:1<\/a><\/span> I do not know of a better and surer way than to follow the word of God.

The world say that Joseph Smith was an impostor. I would ask, Can there be any more effectual means of detecting an impostor, of determining the truth or falsity of his profession, than for him to make to public promises of this kind? If he were an impostor, the signs spoken of would not follow believers, and the power to perform these wonderful works would not be given to those who obeyed his words. Do you not know, strangers, that an impostor would carefully avoid giving such unmistakable proofs of his impositions? Yes, he would be as cautious as the Methodists, and the rest of the so-called Christian denominations, for they do not even profess a belief in them, much less to declare themselves to be in possession of them. But the fact that these signs do follow believers, that this power does exist, is testimony sufficient, and it is a testimony to all the world, that this Gospel message which we preach is divine, and that God is able to do today the same as he did anciently; and you, Latter-day Saints, are witnesses concerning these things. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v18n886\"> Having examined the message that these missionaries proclaim, let me speak a little upon another subject.

I would advise you to go to your minister and ask him where he obtains his evidence to prove that the canon of Scripture is full. You will find that he will appear dumb, because no man can put his finger upon a single passage of Scripture proving such an assertion. Perhaps some have tried to believe it, by quoting certain verses from the last chapter of the Revelation of the Lord to St. John, when on the Isle of Patmos; I have had them quote it to me. You will recollect that John, while on the Isle of Patmos, ninety-six years after the birth of Christ, received wonderful revelations, the Lord commanding him to write them. He wrote them on parchment, and upon the closing up of the scroll the Lord says, &#x201C;If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.&#x201D;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"80901\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 80901)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(80901)\">Rev. 22:18<\/a><\/span> This is often quoted, per<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"269a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD18\/JoD18_0269.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;269a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/6872\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>haps without knowing or considering that John, after his release from Patmos, as history informs us, wrote the Gospel of St. John. Supposing that John was questioned on this point, how do you think he would have explained himself? He would have said that that caution had reference to the book written on Patmos. He would have said further, that the caution was against man&#x2019;s adding, but that God has the right to give to his people line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"58570\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 58570)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(58570)\">Isa. 28:10,13<\/a><\/span> book after book, yea, even ten thousand revelations, or more as he may deem proper; and he never pronounced a curse against himself, but that man has not the right to add a single word. The same language may be found in the book of Deuteronomy, which of course has a direct bearing to the five books of Moses, without any reference whatever to the succeeding books of the Bible. May not the same objection be just as consistently raised against all the books of the Old and New Testament which follow the last book written by Moses, containing the same caution, as against the new revelation of today? Surely the people who lived in and after the days of Moses might just as consistently have objected to receiving any further revelations from the Lord, because of the caution referred to appearing in the Book of Deuteronomy,<span class=\"citation\" id=\"54937\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 54937)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(54937)\">Deut. 4:2<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"55034\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 55034)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(55034)\">Deut. 12:32<\/a><\/span> as the people of today have for objecting to receive any new revelation, because the same caution appears in the last chapter of the revelation on Patmos.
