My husband and I had traveled to one of the most remote locations in our mission so he could conduct temple recommend interviews with members in the Ikot Eyo district. Some in this growing district had been Church members less than two years. All the members lived 3,000 miles away from the nearest temple in Johannesburg, South Africa. None had received their temple endowment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/seeing-the-promises-afar-off.p5\" class=\"\">These members knew the appointed day each month we would come to their district, but even we didn\u2019t know the exact hour we would arrive; nor could we call, for telephones were rare in that part of West Africa. So these committed African Saints gathered early in the morning to wait all day if necessary for their temple recommend interviews. When we arrived, I noticed among those waiting in the searing heat were two Relief Society sisters dressed in bold-patterned wrappers, white blouses, and the traditional African head-ties.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2003\/11\/seeing-the-promises-afar-off.p6\" class=\"\">Many hours later, after all the interviews were completed, as my husband and I drove back along that sandy jungle trail, we were stunned when we saw these two sisters still walking.
