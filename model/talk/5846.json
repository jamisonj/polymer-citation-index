Without you the entire program would be frustrated. As I have said before from this pulpit, when the process of creation occurred, Jehovah, the Creator, under instruction from His Father, first divided the light from the darkness [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24128\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24128)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24128)\">Gen. 1:4<\/a><\/span>] and then separated the land from the waters [<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24129\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24129)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24129)\">Gen. 1:6<\/a><\/span>]. There followed the creation of plant life, followed by the creation of animal life. Then came the creation of man, and culminating that act of divinity came the crowning act, the creation of woman [see <span class=\"citation\" id=\"24133\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24133)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24133)\">Gen. 2:22<\/a><\/span>].<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p6\" class=\"\">Each of you is a daughter of God, endowed with a divine birthright.

Invariably they ask about the place of women in the Church. They do so in an almost accusatory tone, as if we denigrate and demean women. I invariably reply that I know of no other organization in all the world which affords women so many opportunities for development, for sociality, for the accomplishment of great good, for holding positions of leadership and responsibility.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p8\" class=\"\">I wish all of these reporters could have been in the Tabernacle a week ago Saturday when the general Relief Society meeting was held. It was an inspiration to look into the faces of that vast gathering of the daughters of God, women of faith and ability, women who know what life is about and have something of a sense of the divinity of their creation. I wish they could have heard that great chorus of young women from Brigham Young University, who touched our hearts with the beauty of their singing. I wish they could have heard the stirring messages of the Relief Society general presidency, each of whom spoke on a phase of the subject faith, hope, and charity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p9\" class=\"\">What able people these women are. They express themselves with power and conviction and great persuasiveness. President Faust concluded that service with a wonderful talk.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p10\" class=\"\">If those reporters who are prone to raise this question could have sat in that vast congregation, they would have known, even without further inquiry, that there is strength and great capacity in the women of this Church. There is leadership and direction, a certain spirit of independence, and yet great satisfaction in being a part of this, the Lord\u2019s kingdom, and of working hand in hand with the priesthood to move it forward.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p11\" class=\"\">Many of you are here today who were in that meeting. Today you are seated with your husbands, men whom you love and honor and respect, and who in turn love and honor and respect you. You know how fortunate you are to be married to a good man who is your companion in life and who will be your companion throughout eternity. Together, as you have served in many capacities and reared your families and provided for them, you have faced a variety of storms and come through them all with your heads held high. Most of you are mothers, and very many of you are grandmothers and even great-grandmothers. You have walked the sometimes painful, sometimes joyous path of parenthood. You have walked hand in hand with God in the great process of bringing children into the world that they might experience this estate along the road of immortality and eternal life. It has not been easy rearing a family. Most of you have had to sacrifice and skimp and labor night and day. As I think of you and your circumstances, I think of the words of Anne Campbell, who wrote as she looked upon her children:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">You are the trip I did not take;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">You are the pearls I cannot buy;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">You are my blue Italian lake;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">You are my piece of foreign sky.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"citationInfo\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p16\" class=\"\">(\u201cTo My Child,\u201d quoted in Charles L.

Some of them put on a fine face before the world during the day and come home in the evening, set aside their self-discipline, and on the slightest provocation fly into outbursts of anger.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p19\" class=\"\">No man who engages in such evil and unbecoming behavior is worthy of the priesthood of God. No man who so conducts himself is worthy of the privileges of the house of the Lord. I regret that there are some men undeserving of the love of their wives and children. There are children who fear their fathers, and wives who fear their husbands. If there be any such men within the hearing of my voice, as a servant of the Lord I rebuke you and call you to repentance. Discipline yourselves. Master your temper. Most of the things that make you angry are of very small consequence. And what a terrible price you are paying for your anger. Ask the Lord to forgive you. Ask your wife to forgive you. Apologize to your children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p20\" class=\"\">There are many women among us who are single. Generally, this is not of their own choice.

And do not give up trying. But do give up being obsessed with it. The chances are that if you forget about it and become anxiously engaged in other activities, the prospects will brighten immeasurably. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p22\" class=\"\">\u201cI believe that for most of us the best medicine for loneliness is work, service in behalf of others. I do not minimize your problems, but I do not hesitate to say that there are many others whose problems are more serious than are yours. Reach out to serve them, to help them, to encourage them. There are so many boys and girls who fail in school for want of a little personal attention and encouragement. There are so many elderly people who live in misery and loneliness and fear for whom a simple conversation would bring a measure of hope and happiness.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p23\" class=\"\">Included among the women of the Church are those who have lost their husbands through abandonment, divorce, and death.

How much it says about the way this Church functions and should function throughout the world. I hope that every woman who finds herself in the kind of circumstances in which this woman lives is similarly blessed with an understanding and helpful bishop, with a Relief Society president who knows how to assist her, with home teachers who know where their duty lies and how to fulfill it, and with a host of ward members who are helpful without being intrusive.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p36\" class=\"\">I have never met the woman whose letter I have read. Notwithstanding the cheerful attitude she conveys, I am sure there has been much of struggle and loneliness, and at times, fear. I notice that she works to provide for her needs and the needs of her boys, who are in their teens. I assume her income is inadequate, because she indicates that the bishop has helped them with food and clothing.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p37\" class=\"\">Some years ago President Benson delivered a message to the women of the Church.

I sustain the position which he took.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p38\" class=\"\">Nevertheless, I recognize, as he recognized, that there are some women (it has become very many in fact) who have to work to provide for the needs of their families. To you I say, do the very best you can. I hope that if you are employed full-time you are doing it to ensure that basic needs are met and not simply to indulge a taste for an elaborate home, fancy cars, and other luxuries. The greatest job that any mother will ever do will be in nurturing, teaching, lifting, encouraging, and rearing her children in righteousness and truth. None other can adequately take her place.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p39\" class=\"\">It is well-nigh impossible to be a full-time homemaker and a full-time employee. I know how some of you struggle with decisions concerning this matter. I repeat, do the very best you can. You know your circumstances, and I know that you are deeply concerned for the welfare of your children. Each of you has a bishop who will counsel with you and assist you. If you feel you need to speak with an understanding woman, do not hesitate to get in touch with your Relief Society president.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p40\" class=\"\">To the mothers of this Church, every mother who is here today, I want to say that as the years pass, you will become increasingly grateful for that which you did in molding the lives of your children in the direction of righteousness and goodness, integrity and faith.

Your bishop will not ask you to do anything that is beyond your capacity. And as you so serve, a new dimension will be added to your life. You will find new and stimulating associations. You will find friendship and sociality. You will grow in knowledge and understanding and wisdom, and in your capacity to do. You will become a better mother because of the service you give in the work of the Lord.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1996\/11\/women-of-the-church.p44\" class=\"\">Now, in conclusion, I wish to say a word to you older women, many of whom are widows.
