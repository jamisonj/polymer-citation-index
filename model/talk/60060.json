All people have been more or less taught by the Spirit of revelation; and let me say further, there never was a child born upon this earth that was not naturally endowed with that Spirit; and when we try to make ourselves believe differently, we are mistaken. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v6n2217\"> It is extensively taught that nature must be subdued, and grace made to take its place. I wish to inform you that it is nature for the child to be influenced by the Spirit of God. It is nature for all people to be influenced by a good spirit; and the evil that is <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"330b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD06\/JoD06_0330.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;330b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/2430\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> spoken of is the power the Devil has gained upon this earth through the fall.

It is the flesh that is alluded to in that passage. Then why not follow the dictates of the good Spirit? We talk about it, read of it, believe in it&#x2014;that Spirit which gives joy and peace to the children of men, and wishes and does no evil to any person; and that is the Spirit of the Gospel. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v6n2218\"> If people would listen to the whisperings of that Spirit, they would be led into the paths of truth and righteousness. If they would overcome temptations to evil&#x2014;cause their spirits to overcome the flesh, they would bring themselves into subjection to the law of Christ and become Saints of God. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v6n2219\"> You design evils in your neighborhoods, in your families, and in yourselves. The disposition to produce evil, to annoy, to disturb the peace of families, neighbors, and society, is produced by the power of the enemy over the flesh, through the fall. Every person who will examine his own experience&#x2014;who will watch closely the leading of his own desires&#x2014;will learn that the very great majority prefer to do good rather than  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"331a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD06\/JoD06_0331.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;331a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/2429\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>to do evil, and would pursue a correct course, were it not for the evil power that subjects them to its sway. In wrongdoing, their own consciences condemn them. They are taught what is right, they read what is right, and at times the Spirit of the Lord is upon them, teaching them what is right, and would be upon them from their youth, were it not that they give way to temptation and let the flesh overcome the spirits that God has placed within us. I feel to continually urge upon those who profess to be Saints never to grieve that Spirit that enlightens their minds, teaches them righteousness, to love God and their fellow creatures, and to do good to themselves and to all around them, to promote righteousness upon the earth, and overcome iniquity in themselves and those around them as fast as possible. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v6n2221\"> Some may imagine and really believe that I am opposed to the great majority of the inhabitants of the earth&#x2014;to the religious and political parties of the day; but it is not so. To individuals, as such, I am not opposed. The doctrine I preach is not opposed to an individual upon the earth. If I am opposed to anything, it is to sin&#x2014;to that which produces evil in the world. I believe that I may say with perfect safety that I am as clear as the stars that shine in the heavens with regard to opposing any mortal being on the earth, though many construe the opposing of their sins into an opposition to themselves. I do not feel opposed to an individual on the earth. I have not any enmity in my heart, or at least I should not have. If I have, I am thus far wrong. If we harbor vindictiveness, hatred, malice, and a spirit that produces evil within us, we are so far given up to the power of evil. But when I say that I am opposed to evil principles and their consequent practices, I use an ex<div class=\"hyphen\">-<\/div><div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"331b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD06\/JoD06_0331.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;331b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/2429\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>pression that I think you can understand. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v6n2222\"> I am much opposed to men and women who say that they believe in God the Father and in Jesus Christ his Son, and treat their names with lightness. I am very much opposed to a dishonest spirit, and that too in this community as well as in the world. I am very much opposed to deception. I am very much opposed to evil speaking. Now understand me completely as I mean. If I should hear a man advocate the erroneous principles he had imbibed through education, and oppose those principles, some might imagine that I was opposed to that man, when, in fact, I am only opposed to every evil and erroneous principle he advances. His morality, so far as it goes, is good. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v6n2223\"> In the Christian world, thousands and millions of them are as close to the truth as any man that ever lived upon the face of the earth, so far as moral, Christian deportment is concerned. I can find a great many of this community who live as moral lives as men and women can. Is there anything else necessary and important? Yes&#x2014;to so live as to have the light of the Spirit of truth abiding within you day by day, that when you hear the truth, you know it as well as you know the faces of your father's family, and also understand every manifestation produced by erroneous principles. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v6n2224\"> I plead with the Elders of Israel day by day, when I have an opportunity, to live their religion&#x2014;to so live that the Holy Ghost will be their constant companion;<span class=\"citation\" id=\"90911\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 90911)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(90911)\">D&amp;C 121:46<\/a><\/span> and then they will be qualified to be judges in Israel, to preside as Bishops, presiding Elders, and High Councilors, and as men of God, to take their families and friends by the hand and lead them in the path of truth and virtue, and eventually into the kingdom of God. Let me now tell you, Latter-day  <div class=\"break pagebreak\" id=\"332a\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD06\/JoD06_0332.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;332a]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/2428\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div>Saints, that you do not live to your privileges; you do not enjoy that which it is your privilege to enjoy; and when I see and hear of contentions, broils, misrule, bad feelings, ill conduct, wrong in my neighbor or myself, I know that we do not live according to our profession. Why not live above all suspicion and above the power of Satan? This is our privilege. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v6n2226\"> So far as morality is concerned, millions of the inhabitants of the earth live according to the best light they have&#x2014;according to the best knowledge they possess. I have told you frequently that they will receive according to their works; and all who live according to the best principles in their possession, or that they can understand, will receive peace, glory, comfort, joy, and a crown that will be far beyond what they are anticipating. They will not be lost. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v6n2227\"> I was highly gratified by a remark made by the Reverend Mr. Vaux, the gentleman who has just addressed you, that the terror of the Lord<span class=\"citation\" id=\"74186\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 74186)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(74186)\">2 Cor. 5:11<\/a><\/span><span class=\"citation\" id=\"85755\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 85755)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(85755)\">D&amp;C 45:67,75<\/a><\/span> never can, neither should, in the nature of things, bring men to repentance. Those of you who are acquainted with the history of the world reflect upon the conduct of the inhabitants of the earth; and when did tyranny ever cause repentance of evil? Never. It produces crime. When men are infringed upon in their rights and tyrannized over, they are prone to rise in their might and declare, &#x201C;We will do as we please, and will let you know that we will have the ruling of our own rights and dispositions.&#x201D; Tyrannical power may possess the ability to behead them, hang them, or sentence them to prison; but resolute men will have their will. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v6n2228\"> Unless a ruler has the power of the Priesthood, he cannot rule the minds of the people and win their unbounded confidence and love. To <div class=\"break columnbreak\" id=\"332b\">[<a href=\"\/jod\/pdf\/JoD06\/JoD06_0332.pdf\" target=\"pdfwin\">p.&#xA0;332b]<b class=\"impdf\"><\/b><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/contentdm.lib.byu.edu\/utils\/getfile\/collection\/JournalOfDiscourses3\/id\/2428\" target=\"pdfwin2\"><b class=\"imhbll\"><\/b><\/a><\/div> illustrate my idea, I will relate an anecdote. A young man entered the ministry, but soon learned that he could not rule the minds of the people. He then turned his attention to the study and practice of medicine, and directly discovered that the power of evil had induced the people to care more for their bodies than for their souls; but that profession did not give him the influence he desired, for he found the will of the people first and foremost with them. He then studied law, and could command all the influence he desired, for their wills they would gratify in preference to either soul or body. You cannot break down the indomitable will of the human family. I have known children to be so abused and whipped as to render them almost or entirely worthless, and still the indomitable will remained. How came it there? God organized us to become absolutely independent, and the will I am speaking about is implanted in us by him; and the spirit of every intelligent being is organized to become independent according to its capacity. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v6n2229\"> You cannot break nor destroy the will. It is influenced and controlled, more or less, by the evil that is sown in the flesh, but not in the spirit, until the body has grown to years of accountability; then evil, when listened to, begins to rule and overrule the spirit God has placed within man. <\/div><div class=\"paragraph jod\" id=\"v6n2230\"> The Apostles and Prophets, when speaking of our relationship to God, say that we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone.<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52521\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52521)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52521)\">Gen. 2:23<\/a><\/span> God is our Father, and Jesus Christ is our Elder Brother, and both are our everlasting friends.
