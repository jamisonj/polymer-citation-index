As one who has recently come into the\npresiding councils of the Church, I can assure them that they can look forward to some of the\nsweetest, most soul-satisfying experiences that come to men in this life. With all my heart I\nwelcome them and assure them of my love and confidence.\n<\/p><p>\nOBLIGATIONS RESTING UPON THE CHURCH\n<\/p><p>\nI have been impressed during this conference, with the great responsibilities and obligations\nresting upon this Church and its people. I was impressed with the inspiring message of\nPresident Grant, which called to our attention some of these obligations which are ours as\nleaders. I have often felt that there are three great and important obligations, possibly\nover-shadowing all others, which rest upon this people and upon this great Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints. The first of these, at least in the order of emphasis in this\ndispensation, is that of missionary work&mdash;the responsibility which rests upon this people to\ncarry the message of the restored gospel to the people of the world. We have been engaged in\nthat work ever since the Church was organized, yea, even before. Secondly, we have the\nresponsibility of building up the stakes and wards and branches of Zion. This entails the\nbuilding of a material kingdom, as well as a spiritual kingdom. It entails the providing of\nfacilities&mdash;houses of worship, temples, seminary buldings&mdash;that are so necessary for us to carry\non the spiritual part of the program. It entails taking care of our people, temporally,\nphysically, culturally, and socially, as well as spiritually. And in the third place, we have the\ngreat responsibility of performing certain sacred ordinances in the temples of the Lord,&mdash;a\nresponsibility which rests upon every holder of the priesthood as well as upon the sisters of\nthe Church.\n<\/p><p>\nMISSIONARY RESPONSIBILITY\n<\/p><p>\nI was pleased to note the importance which President Grant placed in his message on the first\nmentioned obligation&mdash;that of missionary service. In reading the revelations which the Lord\nhas given to us in this dispensation, I have been impressed to note that probably on no other\nsubject has he referred so frequently as in the case of our obligation as a people to carry this\nmessage of the restored gospel to the people of the world. In reading again the revelations\nwhich the Lord has given us, I noted that at least twenty-five to thirty of these revelations\nmake specific mention of this great responsibility which is ours. I noted, too,\nthat in some of the revelations, given more than a year before the Church was organized, the\nLord made special mention of this important mission of the Latter-day Saints. May I call your\nattention, this evening, to a few of those revelations? There will not be time to discuss, in any\ndetail, any of them. I simply call them to your attention. In February of 1829, the Lord said\nthis:\n<\/p><p>\nNow behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men.\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart,\nmight, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12073\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12073)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12073)\">D&amp;C 4:1-2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThen he goes on to point out in that and other revelations:\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap, let him thrust\nin his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul\neverlasting salvation in the kingdom of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12078\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12078)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12078)\">D&amp;C 6:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nMany of those who came in contact with the Prophet Joseph, even prior to the organization of\nthe Church, became convinced and received testimonies of the genuineness of his message. It\nwas not an uncommon thing for them to approach the Prophet and ask him to inquire of the\nLord as to their responsibilities and obligations. You recall the important part played by the\nWhitmer family. It was in the home of Peter Whitmer, Sr., that the Book of Mormon was\ntranslated&mdash;at least the latter part of it was completed there. John, David, and Peter Whitmer,\nJr., approached the Prophet and asked if he would inquire of the Lord as to what they might\ndo,&mdash;what was their duty as men who had recently received the testimony of the truth. The\nProphet made inquiry and we have three sections of the D&amp;C devoted to the answer to these\ninquiries. They are very similar. May I read from section 15&mdash;the answer to the request of\nJohn Whitmer.\n<\/p><p>\nHearken, my servant John, and listen to the words of Jesus Christ, your Lord and your\nRedeemer.\n<\/p><p>\nFor behold, I speak unto you with sharpness and with power, for mine arm is over all the\nearth.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd I will tell you that which no man knoweth save me and thee alone&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nFor many times you have desired of me to know that which would be of most worth unto\nyou.\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, blessed are you for this thing, and for speaking my words which I had given you\naccording to my commandments.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd now, behold, I say unto you, that the thing which will be of most worth unto you will be\nto declare repentance unto this people, that you may bring souls unto me, that you may rest\nwith them in the kingdom of my Father. Amen\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12083\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12083)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12083)\">D&amp;C 15:1-6<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nIt was only a short time after this that the Lord in another revelation, in which he indicated\nthe calling of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles in this dispensation, made this statement:\n<\/p><p>\nRemember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God;\n<\/p><p>\nFor, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the\npain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12084\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12084)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12084)\">D&amp;C 18:10-11<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd further:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and\nbring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of\nmy Father (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12085\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12085)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12085)\">D&amp;C 18:15<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord spoke frequently regarding the obligations of the elders of the Church and ofttimes\ncommended them for their faithfulness and devotion, even to the extent of indicating that\nwhatever they spoke when moved upon by the Holy Ghost would be the will of the Lord, the\nword of the Lord, and would be scripture to the people. Yet, at times, in those days, as in this\nday, there were men who feared men more than the Lord, and occasionally he had reason to\nchastise some of the elders of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nIn section 60, we read the following verse:\n<\/p><p>\nBut with some I am not well pleased, for they will not open their mouths, but they hide the\ntalent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of man. Wo unto such, for mine\nanger is kindled against them (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12119\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12119)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12119)\">D&amp;C 60:2<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then in the 68th section&mdash;reference to which I have already made&mdash;\n<\/p><p>\nAnd whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture,\nshall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord,\nshall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12126\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12126)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12126)\">D&amp;C 68:4<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd this additional great and important promise, made to those who go forward as\nmissionaries carrying the message of the restored gospel:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd any man that shall go and preach this gospel of the kingdom, and fail not to continue\nfaithful in all things, shall not be weary in mind, neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor\njoint; and a hair of his head shall not bow to the ground unnoticed. And they shall not go\nhungry, neither athirst (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12153\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12153)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12153)\">D&amp;C 84:80<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nSo the early missionaries of the Church went forward, beginning with Samuel H. Smith, only\na few days after the Church was organized. The number increased until the message was\ncarried to all parts of the then known United States&mdash;into Canada, and by 1837, missionaries\nwere on the eastern hemisphere. Even during the dark days of Missouri and Illinois and in the\npilgrimage across the plains, missionaries went forward with their work. At times it was\ninterrupted slightly, but always there was that urge and desire on the part of the elders of the\nChurch, who had burning within their souls the testimony of the truth&mdash;to\ncarry the message of the restored gospel to the people of the world. After the Saints arrived in\nthe valley, it was not an uncommon thing to have read long lists of names of men attending\nthe general conference of the Church, who were called to go into the mission field and carry\nthe message of the restored gospel. In later years it became the custom to issue the calls by\nletter.\n<\/p><p>\nA PERSONAL FAMILY EXPERIENCE\n<\/p><p>\nI shall ever be grateful for an experience which came into our family during this latter period\nthat I refer to; something over thirty years ago. It was during the time when sacrament\nmeetings were held on Sunday afternoon, at two o'clock, at least in the rural wards. I\nremember very well this particular Sunday afternoon, as father and mother returned from\nsacrament meeting, in the one horse buggy. As they drove into the yard and their little brood\nof seven kiddies gathered around the buggy, we witnessed a thing which we had never seen\nbefore in our family. Both father and mother were in tears. We had often seen mother in tears\nand father offering consolation, or father weeping and mother offering sympathy. But never\nbefore had we seen them both crying at the same time. We inquired as to the reason, and we\nwere assured that everything was all right. As we followed them into the house and sat down\nin the living room, mother told us that father had received a letter from Box \"B.\" That was a\ncall to go on a mission. She explained that they were grateful that he was considered worthy\nto go and that they were happy; but they knew that it meant separation for a period of two\nyears, and they had never been separated more than one night at a time in all of their married\nlife.\n<\/p><p>\nThis is only a little thing. Practically every family in the Church could tell similar and even\nmore impressive experiences in connection with this great missionary movement. Father went,\nas your fathers and grandfathers went. The eighth member of our family was born after he got\ninto the field. How I appreciate the faith of our mothers, and our grandmothers. Important has\nbeen their responsibility in connection with this great missionary service.\n<\/p><p>\nMISSIONARY WORK OF MEN IN THE ARMED SERVICE\n<\/p><p>\nNow, during this critical period, through which we are passing&mdash;this war period&mdash;our\nmissionary program has been seriously interfered with. I visited a mission not long ago and\nfound not one single young man of military age in the missionary service&mdash;all were in the\narmed service of their country. The missionary corps was about ten percent of the normal\nnumber and made up almost entirely of young women missionaries and elderly married\ncouples. And yet, as I have thought of this war condition, through which we are passing, and\nthe effect upon our missionary program,&mdash;I cannot help feeling that we are probably doing\nmore total missionary work today than we have ever done in the history of the Church. While\nour number of fulltime missionaries has been reduced, we have, it is\nestimated, almost one hundred thousand of our young men in the service of their country,\nhundreds and thousands of whom are doing effective missionary work.\n<\/p><p>\nThere came to my office a few days ago a young marine, a former stake missionary, with one\nof his buddies. He told me that he had been doing missionary work with his associates. He\nhad recently baptized this young man, and they had come to the Church office building,\nduring their leave, in the hope that this new convert to the Church could receive a patriarchal\nblessing.\n<\/p><p>\nOnly this week there came to my office several young men, in the uniform of their country,\nwho were thrilled with the experiences they were having in the mission field, although in the\nservice of their country. One of them said, \"Brother Benson, it is just like being on another\nmission. Conditions are different, but we have opportunities to preach the gospel, and we are\ntaking advantage of it.\" A letter from a young man down in the South Pacific, only a few\ndays ago, told of the struggle they had had on one of the islands to get together a small group\nof Latter-day Saints. He said the first time they held a meeting there were only three present.\nThen, gradually the number increased until the day he wrote the letter, which was Sunday, he\nsaid, \"There were sixteen of us at the service today. Four of the boys have joined the Church\nsince the war started.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, my brethren, I feel that we have cause to rejoice that we have boys in the service\nwith faith sufficient, with the testimony of the truth that impels them to carry that missionary\nspirit to their buddies in arms.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE MESSAGE OF THE RESTORATION MUST GO FORWARD\n<\/p><p>\nI know there are many of our friends outside the Church who wonder why we do it, why we\nmake the sacrifice, why we go to the expense of sending out missionaries. We have sent, it is\nestimated, approximately seventy-five thousand missionaries into the field during the brief\nexistence of the Church; at a cost, I am sure, if we figure the money expended and the\nincome sacrificed, of possibly more than two hundred million dollars. Why do we do it? I\nreceived a letter following the last general conference from a young man from this city, not a\nmember of the Church, who asked that very question:\n<\/p><p>\n\"Why does the Mormon Church continue to send missionaries out into the world, particularly\nto Christian countries?\" May I read the words of the First Presidency of this Church, uttered\nthree years ago yesterday, from this very pulpit, in which they gave answer to this question.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is our duty, divinely imposed, to continue urgently and militantly to carry forward our\nmissionary work. We must continue to call missionaries and send them out to preach the\ngospel, which was never more needed than now, which is the only remedy for the tragic ills\nthat now afflict the world, and which alone can bring peace and brotherly love back amongst\nthe peoples of the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nTherefore no act of ours or of the Church must interfere with this God-given mandate. This is\nnot a matter of our own choosing. It is not something that has been devised by man. The\nLord has made it clear to us, my brethren, that the responsibility is ours, as holders of the\npriesthood, to carry this message of the restored gospel to the people of the world. And now,\nduring this period of war-stimulated prosperity, when money seems to flow freely, we hope\nthat as leaders in Zion&mdash;as fathers&mdash;we are making some plans to create a reserve so that when\nthis great struggle is over, our missionary work can go forward with greater impetus and in\ngreater volume than ever before in the history of the Church.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE PREFACE TO THE LORD'S COMMANDMENTS\n<\/p><p>\nI should like to refer, in closing, to one other section in the D&amp;C. I mention this and call this\nrevelation to your attention for the purpose of indicating that our message is a world message.\nIt is not regional, it is not national, it is a message intended for all God's children. I refer to\nthe first section of the D&amp;C, given years after some of these revelations that I have referred\nto. It was given for a particular purpose, to appear as the preface to this book of\ncommandments which the Lord has given us in this dispensation. These are the words of the\nLord, to this Church and to the world:\n<\/p><p>\nHearken, O ye people of my Church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose\neyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon\nthe islands of the sea, listen together. For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and\nthere is none to escape; . . . And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths\nof my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days. . . .\n<\/p><p>\nBehold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and my preface unto the\nbook of my commandments, which I have given them to publish unto you, O inhabitants of\nthe earth.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd then further on:\n<\/p><p>\nAnd again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of the earth: I the Lord am willing to make\nthese things known unto all flesh; For I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men\nshall know that the day speedily cometh; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace\nshall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own dominion. . . .\nSearch these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies and promises\nwhich are in them shall all be fulfilled. What I the Lord hath spoken, I have spoken, and I\nexcuse not myself: and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass\naway, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it\nis the same (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12066\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12066)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12066)\">D&amp;C 1:1-3,4,6,34-35,37-38<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nAnd so, my brethren of the priesthood, our message is a world message, the obligation is\nours. The Lord expects us to carry his message to the inhabitants of the earth. Possibly never\nbefore in the history of the world, has there been a greater need for the simple, but divine\nmessage of the restored gospel. God help us to do our duty in this respect, I pray in the name\nof Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
