I thank the Lord that we will always be a missionary church. The first conversions in this dispensation came through the humble testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith. His efforts were directed first to those he loved most. He converted his father, his mother, and his brothers and sisters. He converted his wife, his neighbors, then Martin Harris, and the schoolteacher, Oliver Cowdery, as well as the Whitmer family. They all felt of the truth and power of his simple testimony.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/planting-gospel-seeds-of-spirituality.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cOn Sunday, April 11th, 1830, Oliver Cowdery preached the first public discourse that was delivered by any of our number,\u201d wrote the Prophet Joseph Smith.

Now, over 140 years later, we see the fruits of missionary efforts in our own families, in our wards, in our branches, and, of course, in this tabernacle today.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/planting-gospel-seeds-of-spirituality.p14\" class=\"\">This gospel is the hope and everlasting salvation for all mankind. The missionary system must be perpetuated by us. Our young men and women should be reared under the loving guidance and influence of a good home, a home where the blessing of a mission is part of each one\u2019s life\u2019s goal; a home where plans for his future mission become part of his life, such as a simple piggy bank on the shelf in the kitchen marked \u201cFor Johnny\u2019s Mission,\u201d a reminder of his dream.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/planting-gospel-seeds-of-spirituality.p15\" class=\"\">Hollywood would never be able to produce the thrilling stories, the real-life dramas, the diaries, the letters home, the testimonies locked in hearts that have resulted from following the Savior\u2019s instruction: \u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36179\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36179)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36179)\">Matt. 28:19<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/planting-gospel-seeds-of-spirituality.p16\" class=\"\">The Savior explained what might happen to some of our efforts.

Some seeds lie dormant for years; others spring forth immediately. Some years ago such a precious seed was planted in fertile soil in Germany.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/planting-gospel-seeds-of-spirituality.p21\" class=\"\">Robert Frederick Lippolt, his wife, and daughters lived in a small city in Central Germany. Robert, a house painter, provided a moderate living for his family. One Sunday, while on her way to the Protestant church, Robert\u2019s wife was approached by Mormon missionaries, who invited her to attend sacrament meeting. She attended and was impressed.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/planting-gospel-seeds-of-spirituality.p22\" class=\"\">After subsequent visits by the missionaries, she was baptized and became active in the Church. From the moment of his wife\u2019s baptism, her husband grew in animosity and bitterness toward the Church. Their daughters were also baptized, resulting in more bitterness.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/planting-gospel-seeds-of-spirituality.p23\" class=\"\">Robert could bear the Mormons no longer; he moved his family from Germany to Vera Cruz, Mexico, and then on to Porto Alegre, Brazil. As soon as they were settled, Robert\u2019s wife continued to spread the news of the gospel. She was causing excitement in Brazil, for the doctrine that she preached was completely new.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/planting-gospel-seeds-of-spirituality.p24\" class=\"\">Bitterness filled Robert. He hated the Mormons.

She asked that he visit Brazil. President Reinhold Stoof visited Brazil in 1927 and reported that much success could be realized among the German-speaking people of Brazil.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/planting-gospel-seeds-of-spirituality.p27\" class=\"\">From the tiny seeds sown by missionaries in Germany and carried across the Atlantic, the First Presidency established a mission in Brazil in February 1935. The work now flourishes. Hundreds, then thousands heard the good news.
