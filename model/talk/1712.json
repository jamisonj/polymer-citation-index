Ashton, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1969, pp. 28-29<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\n<\/p><p>\nSix months ago, by appointment from the First Presidency, we attended a\nmission-wide conference in South Africa. After four glorious days with the wonderful people\nof that nation, and as we were leaving, many of the members said: \"When you return, please\ngive our best regards and love to our friends all over the world.\" Little did they realize, and\nlittle did I realize at that time, that I would have this kind of an opportunity of extending their\nlove to their friends worldwide.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Ye are my friends\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSince this responsibility has come to me, I have thought a great deal about friends in\nthe gospel of Jesus Christ. I am reminded in the 84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants,\nthat great revelation on priesthood, of how the Savior reported through the Prophet Joseph\nSmith, in verse 63, \". . . you are mine apostles, even God's high priests; ye are they whom\nmy Father hath given me; ye are my friends\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15398\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15398)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15398)\">D&amp;C 84:63<\/a><\/span>),\nindicating the importance and blessing of being\nrecognized as a friend of the Savior.\n<\/p><p>\nMay I leave this thought with you as we think of friends and the part they should play in our\nlives as Latter-day Saints. Perhaps this simple illustration will help us to realize the need of\nbeing friends in the home, friends in the neighborhood, and friends in the community.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Incident of newspaper boy<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSome months ago my wife and I were in the front of our yard when the newspaper\nboy came down the street on his bicycle. His bicycle was loaded with papers. About twenty\nor thirty yards in back of him, there was another boy following him on a bicycle. I was not\nsure at that time what their relationship was, but I did notice they were coming down the\nstreet at a pretty good clip.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the newspaper boy came to our sidewalk entry, he was traveling too fast to make the\napproach to our home, and, as a result, he went one way, the bicycle went another way, and\nthe papers went everywhere. Noticing the boy had fallen on the lawn and was not hurt, but\nrealizing that he would undoubtedly be embarrassed from the fall in front of his friend, we\nmoved toward him.\n<\/p><p>\nAt the sight of this perfect three-point landing, if we may refer to it as that, his companion\nshouted his pleasure and laughed heartily with complete and full enjoyment at the misfortune\nof his associate.\n<\/p><p>\nTrying to relieve the embarrassment of the paper boy, knowing he didn't want help but he\nwanted to have his pride repaired a little, I took a few more steps toward him and said: \"It's\nkind of a low blow to have your friend laugh when you've had a bad spill, isn't it?\"\n<\/p><p>\nHe went on picking up his papers without even looking up. Finally, he had the papers back in\nplace and got on his bicycle; and as he started out away from our home, he made the remark:\n\"He isn't my friend&mdash;he's my brother.\"\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Living as close friends<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nHis words have been ringing through my ears with a great deal of significance ever\nsince then. Brothers and sisters, I sincerely feel that one of the great purposes of family\nevenings and home teaching is to have family members realize that a brother can be a friend,\nand that a sister can be a friend, and that a father and a mother can be more than parents, they\ncan be friends.\n<\/p><p>\nI would hope and pray that we may catch the wisdom and the inspiration of building a home\nso that our members in that sacred unit can look upon a father and say, \"He is my best\nfriend,\" or \"My mother is more than a mother, she is my friend.\" When we realize that\nparents and family members can be more than blood relations and are in very deed friends,\nthen we will have a glimpse of how our Heavenly Father wants us to live,\nnot only as brothers and sisters but as very close friends.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Appreciation for confidence<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI humbly bear testimony to you this day that this is our Heavenly Father's work, and\nthat I approach this new assignment in all humility, aware of the fact that I need your\nblessings to carry on and to function as our Master would have me serve. May I express to\nPresident David O. McKay my gratitude and appreciation for his confidence in calling me to\nserve with him and these brethren, my friends, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. \n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
