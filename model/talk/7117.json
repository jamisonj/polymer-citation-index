I make it clear that I did not advance his name. That was done by others whose right it was to do so. I feel extremely sensitive about the matter of nepotism. As the lawyers say, I recused myself from participating. However, I believe he is worthy and qualified in every respect. In the first place, he had a great and wonderful mother.

I do so in response to a number of requests that have come to me concerning the position of the Church on a practice that is becoming more common among us, and particularly among our youth. That is the matter of gambling in various forms.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/gambling.p10\" class=\"\">The story is told that one Sunday Calvin Coolidge, onetime president of the United States and a man noted for few words, returned from church.

He replied, \u201cSin.\u201d \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe was against it,\u201d was his reply.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/gambling.p11\" class=\"\">I think I could answer the question concerning gambling just that briefly. We are against it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/gambling.p12\" class=\"\">Gambling is to be found almost everywhere and is growing. People play poker. They bet on horse races and dog races. They play roulette and work the slot machines. They gather to play in bars, saloons, and casinos, and, all too often, in their own homes. Many cannot leave it alone. It becomes addictive. In so many cases it leads to other destructive habits and practices.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/gambling.p13\" class=\"\">And so very many of those who become involved cannot afford the money it takes. In many cases it robs wives and children of financial security.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/gambling.p14\" class=\"\">The game of poker, as it is called, is becoming a college and even a high school craze.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/gambling.p15\" class=\"\">I read to you from a <span class=\"emphasis\">New York Times<\/span> News Service article:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/gambling.p16\" class=\"\">\u201cFor Michael Sandberg, it started a few years ago with nickel-and-dime games among friends.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/gambling.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cBut last fall, he says, it became the source of a six-figure income and an alternative to law school.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/gambling.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cSandberg, 22, essentially splits his time between Princeton, where he is a senior and a politics major, and Atlantic City, where he plays high-stakes poker. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2005\/05\/gambling.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cSandberg\u2019s is an extreme example of a gambling revolution on the nation\u2019s college campuses.

In December, for example, a sorority at Columbia University conducted its first, 80-player, poker tournament with a $10 buy-in, a minimum amount required to play, while the University of North Carolina conducted its first tournament, a 175-player competition, in October. Both games filled up and had waiting lists. At the University of Pennsylvania, private games are advertised every night in a campus e-mail list\u201d (Jonathan Cheng, \u201cPoker Is Major College Craze,\u201d in <span class=\"emphasis\">Deseret Morning News,<\/span> Mar. 14, 2005, p.

He used to have a job, which he quit because he is so addicted to the Internet and poker playing for money right now. He enters poker tournaments all the time, and, if he wins, that is the money that he [uses] to buy the things that he needs.

The pursuit of a game of chance may seem like harmless fun. But there attaches to it an intensity that actually shows on the faces of those who are playing. And in all too many cases this practice, which appears innocent, can lead to an actual addiction. The Church has been and is now opposed to this practice.
