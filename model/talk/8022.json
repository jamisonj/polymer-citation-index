All that is needed is a piece of paper with two columns: \u201cname\u201d and \u201cplan for next or needful ordinance.\u201d I did this recently, listing each family member. Among them, I noted an infant grandson, soon to be blessed; a six-year-old grandson, whose preparation for baptism was essential; and a son turning 18, whose preparation for the priesthood and temple endowment was imminent. Everyone on the list needed the sacrament ordinance. This simple exercise assisted Lesa and me in fulfilling our role to help each member of our family along the covenant path, with an action plan for each of them. Perhaps this is an idea for you which will lead to family discussions, family home evening lessons, preparation, and even invitations for essential ordinances in your family.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote12-10905_000_44stevenson\">12<\/a> <span class=\"footnote\">[David A.

However, even more impressive and surprising to the world was the way she reached out and demonstrated Christlike love to her competitors. She noticed that American snowboarder Kelly Clark, who had a bad first run in her final round, appeared to be nervous about her second run. \u201cShe gave me a hug,\u201d Clark recalls. \u201cShe just held me until I actually calmed down enough and I slowed my breathing.
