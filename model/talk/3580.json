A fear of being misunderstood kept me from expressing the thought, \u201cHave you considered spending an hour or two at one of our cemeteries?\u201d I never did reveal to him that wherever I travel I try to pay a visit to the town cemetery.

Many of those persons left home and family in verdant Switzerland and, in response to the call, \u201cCome to Zion,\u201d settled the communities where they now \u201crest in peace.\u201d They endured spring floods, summer droughts, scant harvests, and back-breaking labors.

But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the republic they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours, to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/he-is-risen.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cYours very sincerely and respectfully, Abraham Lincoln.\u201d (21 Nov. 1864; quoted in <span class=\"emphasis\">Selections from the Letters, Speeches, and State Papers of Abraham Lincoln,<\/span> ed.

The Sullivans, who wished to avenge their friend, insisted that they remain together, and the navy granted their wish. On November 14, 1942, the cruiser on which the brothers served, the U.S.S. <span class=\"emphasis\">Juneau,<\/span> was hit and sunk in a battle off Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/he-is-risen.p15\" class=\"\">Almost two months went by before Mrs. Thomas Sullivan received the news, which arrived not by the usual telegram, but by special envoy: all five of her sons were reported missing in action in the South Pacific and presumed dead.

Such was the experience of a teacher of girls, even twelve-year-olds in the Beehive class of Mutual. She had no children of her own, though she and her husband dearly longed for children. Her love was expressed through the devotion to her special girls as she taught them eternal truths and lessons of life. Then came illness, followed by death. She was but twenty-seven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/he-is-risen.p18\" class=\"\">Each year, on Memorial Day, her girls made a pilgrimage of prayer to the graveside of their teacher. First there were seven, then four, then two, and eventually just one, who continued the annual visit, always placing on the grave a bouquet of irises\u2014a symbol of heartfelt gratitude. This year marked her twenty-fifth visit to the resting place of her teacher. Today she herself is a teacher of girls. Little wonder she is so successful. She mirrors the reflection of the teacher from whom came her inspiration. The life that teacher lived, the lessons that teacher taught, are not buried beneath the headstone which marks her grave, but live on in the personalities she helped to shape and the lives she so selflessly enriched. One is reminded of another master teacher, even the Lord. Once, with His finger, He wrote in the sand a message.

The residents of the community had placed aside their daily tasks, children were excused from school, and all thronged to the chapel to express their deep feelings of condolence.

He paid tribute to Louis, the oldest boy.

Its message was brief\u2014just three words: \u201cI love you.\u201d She could barely complete her talk, so deep-felt were her emotions.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/he-is-risen.p25\" class=\"\">Through the tears and the sorrow of that special day, I observed eternal lessons that had been taught by those boys whose lives were honored and whose mortal missions concluded.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1981\/11\/he-is-risen.p26\" class=\"\">A coach expressed the determination to look beyond athletic prowess and into the heart of each boy. A youth leader made a solemn vow that every boy and girl would have the benefit which the program of the Church provided. An elementary school teacher looked at the small children, classmates of Jason. She said nothing, but her eyes revealed the determination of her soul. The message was unmistakably clear: \u201cI will love each child.
