They drove their laden wagons and their livestock down Parley Street\u2014a street that became known as the \u201cStreet of Tears\u201d\u2014to a landing where they were ferried across the river to Iowa.

Hardships caused by cold, snow, rain, mud, sickness, hunger, and death challenged the faith of these hardy pioneers. But they were determined to follow their leaders and to do, no matter the cost, what they believed fervently to be the will of God.
