At that time I addressed one of those doctrinal issues\u2014our scripturally based view of the Godhead. Today I would like to address the other major doctrine which characterizes our faith but which causes concern to some, namely the bold assertion that God continues to speak His word and reveal His truth, revelations which mandate an open canon of scripture.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/my-words-never-cease.p9\" class=\"\">Some Christians, in large measure because of their genuine love for the Bible, have declared that there can be no more authorized scripture beyond the Bible. In thus pronouncing the canon of revelation closed, our friends in some other faiths shut the door on divine expression that we in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hold dear: the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and the ongoing guidance received by God\u2019s anointed prophets and apostles. Imputing no ill will to those who take such a position, nevertheless we respectfully but resolutely reject such an unscriptural characterization of true Christianity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/my-words-never-cease.p10\" class=\"\">One of the arguments often used in any defense of a closed canon is the New Testament passage recorded in <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51723\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51723)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51723)\">Revelation 22:18<\/a><\/span>: \u201cFor I testify unto every man that heareth the words of \u2026 this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.\u201d However, there is now overwhelming consensus among virtually all biblical scholars that this verse applies only to the book of Revelation, <span class=\"emphasis\">not<\/span> the whole Bible. Those scholars of our day acknowledge a number of New Testament \u201cbooks\u201d that were almost certainly written <span class=\"emphasis\">after<\/span> John\u2019s revelation on the Isle of Patmos was received. Included in this category are at least the books of Jude, the three Epistles of John, and probably the entire Gospel of John itself.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-02205_000_032\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[For an introductory discussion on this topic, see Stephen\u00a0E.

That is because the whole Bible as we know it\u2014one collection of texts bound in a single volume\u2014did not exist when that verse was written. For centuries after John produced his writing, the individual books of the New Testament were in circulation singly or perhaps in combinations with a few other texts but almost <span class=\"emphasis\">never <\/span>as a complete collection. Of the entire corpus of 5,366 known Greek New Testament manuscripts, only 35 contain the whole New Testament as we now know it, and 34 of those were compiled after <span class=\"small\">A.D.<\/span> 1000.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-02205_000_032\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Bruce\u00a0M.

The Old Testament does not lose its value in our eyes when we are introduced to the New Testament, and the New Testament is only enhanced when we read the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. In considering the additional scripture accepted by Latter-day Saints, we might ask: Were those early Christians who for decades had access only to the primitive Gospel of Mark (generally considered the first of the New Testament Gospels to be written)\u2014were they offended to receive the more detailed accounts set forth later by Matthew and Luke, to say nothing of the unprecedented passages and revelatory emphasis offered later yet by John? Surely they must have rejoiced that ever more convincing evidence of the divinity of Christ kept coming.

As he said in his own words, the ministers of his community were contending\u2014sometimes angrily\u2014over their doctrines. \u201cPriest [was] contending against priest, and convert [was contending] against convert \u2026 in a strife of words and a contest about opinions,\u201d he said. About the only thing these contending religions had in common was, ironically, a belief in the Bible, but, as Joseph wrote, \u201cthe teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question [regarding which church was true] by an appeal to the Bible.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-02205_000_032\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"52006\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 52006)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(52006)\">Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:6, 12<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup> Clearly the Bible, so frequently described at that time as \u201ccommon ground,\u201d was nothing of the kind\u2014unfortunately it was a battleground.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/my-words-never-cease.p16\" class=\"\">Thus one of the great purposes of continuing revelation through living prophets is to declare to the world through additional witnesses that the Bible is true. <span class=\"emphasis\">\u201cThis <\/span>is written,\u201d an ancient prophet said, speaking of the Book of Mormon, \u201cfor the intent that ye may believe <span class=\"emphasis\">that,\u201d<\/span> speaking of the Bible.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote8-02205_000_032\">8<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"51864\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51864)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51864)\">Mormon 7:9<\/a><\/span>; emphasis added.]<\/span><\/sup> In one of the earliest revelations received by Joseph Smith, the Lord said, \u201cBehold, I do not bring [the Book of Mormon forth] to destroy [the Bible] but to build it up.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote9-02205_000_032\">9<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"51890\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51890)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51890)\">D&amp;C 10:52<\/a><\/span>; see also <span class=\"citation\" id=\"51896\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 51896)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(51896)\">D&amp;C 20:11<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2008\/05\/my-words-never-cease.p17\" class=\"\">One other point needs to be made.
