Morris, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1954, pp. 97-100<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brethren and sisters: I thank the Lord for the privilege of being with you this\nmorning and of having fellowship with you in the Church of Jesus Christ, and I thank the\nLord for the instructions, the simple, beautiful, convincing gospel instructions that we have\nreceived this morning and in all preceding sessions of this conference.\n<\/p><p>\nI am wholly dependent upon my Father in heaven and upon your assistance in that he shall\nlead me to say the things that I should say upon this occasion.\n<\/p><p>\nThis Church for a century and a quarter has been declaring these truths to the world.  The\ntestimonies we have heard, the teachings of the gospel, the purposes of the Lord, have been\npreached to the world during all this period by men who have been called of God to do so,\nand the message to the world is and has been that the Church of Jesus Christ\nnow exists in the world, and that prophets and Apostles are directing the affairs of his Church. \nIndeed, just as the Lord Jesus Christ in leaving the world to ascend to  the Father left his\nChurch in the hands of Apostles and prophets and the priesthood of the Church, so in this day\nhe has placed in the hands of Apostles and prophets and the priesthood of his Church, his\nChurch and his gospel, the only true and living Church in the world because it is his Church,\nand in it alone lies salvation for the human family.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a glorious message of hope and faith and joy this should be to the distraught world. \nAnd it is such to the honest in heart, those who are seeking with all their hearts to know and\nkeep the commandments of God.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Lord visited this continent and set up his Church among his people soon after his\nascension into the heavens, they were querying after he left them one day, as to what they\nshould name the Church, and when he came the next day to continue his instructions to them,\nhe knew their contentions and queries and said: \n<\/p><p>\nAnd how be it my church save it be called in my name?  For if a church be called in Moses'\nname then it be Moses' church; or if it be called in the name of a man then it be the church\nof a man; but if it be called in my name then it is my church, if so be that it is built upon my\ngospel (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5547\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5547)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5547)\">3 Ne. 27:8<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhat a simple and logical and beautiful explanation of the facts! And that is something to\nguide us in the midst of all the religious confusion that exists in the world today.  The Church\nof Jesus Christ by his direction bears his name.  In this day when it has again been restored,\nthe same instructions came to the Prophet Joseph Smith that this Church should be called the\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"13316\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 13316)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(13316)\">D&amp;C 115:4<\/a><\/span>), the \"Latter-day Saints\" being added to distinguish\nit from all other dispensations.\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord continued in his instructions to the effect that: If the Church has his name and it is\nbuilt upon his gospel, then it is his Church; and if they would pray to the Father he would\nhear their prayers, and his works shall be manifest in the Church\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5545\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5545)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5545)\">3 Ne. 27:7-10<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nNote the significant qualification added that not only must it have his name, but it must also\nbe based upon his gospel.  Then he adds that if churches are built that are based upon the\nworks of men or the works of Satan, then these will have joy in their churches for a period\nbut the time will come when they will be hewn down and cast into the fire\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5548\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5548)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5548)\">3 Ne. 27:11-12<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe Lord has very clearly set before us in this simple statement a guiding principle: There is\none Church of Jesus Christ, bearing his name and preaching his gospel.  All other churches\nare the churches of men, and there can be no salvation in them, and the time will come when\nthey will be destroyed.\n<\/p><p>\nWhen the Prophet Joseph Smith was a youth, he had to come before the whole Christian\nworld and declare to them the principle that there could be only one true church in the world. \nIn his search for the truth he had been logical in his thinking; he wanted to serve God and\nkeep his commandments; and as he viewed the denominations in Christendom, he concluded\nthat all these churches could not be true, that they might all be wrong, but that they could not\nall be right, and then, as we have had explained to us by previous speakers, he received in the\npresence of the Father and the Son the latter's words that all the creeds were wrong and that\nthey were an abomination in the sight of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"30335\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 30335)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(30335)\">JS&mdash;H 1:19<\/a><\/span>).  They were the creeds of men that were not\ntrue, and untruth God cannot tolerate.\n<\/p><p>\nAfter a century there has been some change in thought, perhaps the leaven has been at work. \nThere are many Christian leaders in the denominations today who are declaring there can be\nbut one true Church, and they have a most sincere desire to unify the divergent denominations\nmaking up the Christian churches of the world.  About a month ago they held in the Chicago\narea a World Council of Churches, desiring if possible to work toward unity. It is interesting\nto note that this great council of nearly six hundred delegates representing forty-eight\ncountries and about 160 denominations met within the precincts of one of\nthe stakes of the Church of Jesus Christ that has been restored to the earth, and in the general\nlocation in our country where Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith became martyrs for their\ntestimony concerning the one true Church, the Church of Jesus Christ, that had been restored.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is interesting to note that in their desire for unity, many of the church leaders are speaking\nforthrightly to their people.  One prominent speaker expressed this thought that if Jesus Christ\nshould come to the earth today and see the denominations bearing his name, he would say, \"If\nthese are Christian churches, then I am not a Christian.\n<\/p><p>\nI want to read, not exact quotations, but some expressions here, because I want them to be\naccurate in representing what others are thinking.  One particular Protestant writer in great\nclearness and sincerity, expresses his belief that the churches should become united, and states\nthese reasons: \n<\/p><p>\nThat Protestantism is conscious and the demonstrations agree that the true Church exists in the\nmind of Christ, but that he recognizes none of the denominations as his Church.\n<\/p><p>\nThat there should be one united Church, that it now exists, but it is hidden by man-made\ndenominational churches.\n<\/p><p>\nThat the true Church can only come by a dissolution of the denominational churches as\nchurches, which are but an apostate denominational system.\n<\/p><p>\nThat the way to a united church is for the denominations to abdicate their churchism and the\nchurch functions which they have sinfully usurped.\n<\/p><p>\nThat the desire of many leaders of Christendom is to release the believers of Christ from the\nProtestant apostasy into which it has been led by the evil spirit of sectarianism.\n<\/p><p>\nThat in bringing about the united church the errors must be avoided which led Protestantism\ninto the apostasy of sectarianism.\n<\/p><p>\nSuch are the ideas now current in Protestantism.\n<\/p><p>\nMen are not satisfied with the conditions of the denominations in the world.  To understand\nhow the apostasy thus described came about, they need to understand the truth that has been\nreferred to here, that there have been various dispensations of the gospel, that there were long\nperiods when it was not on the earth.  It should be understood that the Dispensation of the\nMeridian of Time was but a restoration of the gospel previously taken from the earth and that\nalthough that dispensation was glorified by the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, himself\nopening it and in it offering his great atonement, yet it was to come to an end. It should also\nbe clearly understood as was explained in this conference, that when the prophets and the\nApostles, the very foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ, disappeared, then his Church of\nnecessity disappeared.  That dispensation ended.  The true Church was again taken from the\nearth.  This being so, then it is clear that men had no way of knowing the will of God, of\npreserving the true principles of the gospel, of continuing to know the true and living God. \nThe revelations of God were not available to them.  It must follow, therefore, that all the\nchurches built up since the Apostles and prophets and the true Church were taken from the\nearth are churches made by men, and \"the power of God unto salvation\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42711\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42711)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42711)\">Rom. 1:16<\/a><\/span>) could not be in them.\n<\/p><p>\nIf people could but understand this principle, if our youth could, then they would look for the\nrestored Church of Jesus Christ of the last dispensation which bears his name, is built upon\nhis gospel, and which has in it his authority and power&mdash;his Apostles and prophets\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21671\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21671)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21671)\">Eph. 2:20<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nJust for a moment may we glance at what constitutes the setting up of the Church of Christ? \nMen set up their churches day by day, by private interpretations of the scriptures, but for the\nChurch of Jesus Christ, which can come from God only, to be set up, the heavens must be\nopened, a dispensation of truth must come.  First of all, God ordinarily, with an exception I\nshall note, appears to a man whom he has selected as his prophet, and reveals himself to him,\nfor a true Church cannot be built on a false faith and a false God.  So that it may be known\nnot only what kind of being he is but who he is, he identifies himself as the true and living\nGod.  Then he gives this man his authority, the Holy Priesthood; thus he is\nequipped so that the Lord may direct him step by step to establish the Church in the earth. \nThat was what the Lord did with Abraham who talked with God face to face\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7199\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7199)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7199)\">Abr. 3:11<\/a><\/span>), and he received\nthe priesthood and the Urim and Thummim\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"7198\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 7198)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(7198)\">Abr. 3:1<\/a><\/span>). The Lord gave him needful revelations, telling\nhim what to do and where to go, and made covenants with him.\n<\/p><p>\nRegarding the Dispensation of the Meridian of Time, the Lord in that instance did not come\nand choose a prophet, but the Father sent his Firstborn, whom by divine investiture he had\nelevated to the Godhead, sharing with him the glory and the honor and the power of his own\nFatherhood, he sent him to be his Only Begotten Son in the flesh; so that he came with all\nthis power and authority that was in him.  He, the Spirit of light, he from whom the\npriesthood comes, he from whom revelations come, he himself came as directed by the Father\nand for thirty-three years lived in the world, revealing himself and revealing through himself\nGod the eternal Father (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"27606\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 27606)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(27606)\">John 14:6-9<\/a><\/span>),\nbeing in his express image (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24259\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24259)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24259)\">Heb. 1:3<\/a><\/span>),\nand taught the principles of the gospel of\nsalvation as directed by the Father, atoned for the sins of the world and instituted the\nresurrection from the dead.\n<\/p><p>\nThese are the simple truths as to a restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and it is the\nsimple truth, that by these means this gospel has again been restored in these last days by the\nLord Jesus Christ, the sole source of salvation for the human family, through the Prophet\nJoseph Smith, who received the Holy Priesthood, followed his instructions, received his\nrevelations and built up again his Church; and thus an open channel of revelation was\nestablished, which channel shall never be closed, for this is the Church of the last dispensation\nand it shall never again be taken from the earth.\n<\/p><p>\nI bear humble witness that this channel of communication is now open and that through it our\nbeloved prophet David O. McKay, receives instructions from God, that this is the Church and\nkingdom of God, and that in it is the power of God unto salvation, because it is the Church of\nJesus Christ.  May God touch the hearts of men and women to understand these simple truths,\nthat they may receive this message with gladness and thanksgiving and embrace it for their\nsalvation and exaltation, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
