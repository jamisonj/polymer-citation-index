With tithing, fast offerings, Relief Society contributions, and, for a while, contributions to the emigration fund, the Church provided for its poor and needy for a hundred years.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/caring-for-the-poor-and-needy.p53\" class=\"\">In the middle of the 1930s, to meet the needs of our times, the Lord revealed through the leaders of his church our present Church welfare program.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/caring-for-the-poor-and-needy.p54\" class=\"\">Through this program, there are made available for the poor and the needy, in addition to tithing and fast offering funds, vast quantities of many varieties of food, clothing, fuel, and other necessities of life. The program also supplies employment opportunities for all who can and will work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/caring-for-the-poor-and-needy.p55\" class=\"\">Thus, through the welfare program, the Lord has given us specific instructions as to how we must provide for the poor in this our day, and he has left no doubt about the dire consequences if we fail to do so. This is what he said in one of the revelations:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/caring-for-the-poor-and-needy.p56\" class=\"\">\u201cI, the Lord,\u201d said he, \u201cstretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/caring-for-the-poor-and-needy.p57\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd it is my purpose to provide for my saints, for all things are mine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/caring-for-the-poor-and-needy.p58\" class=\"\">\u201cBut it must needs be done in mine own way; and behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor shall be exalted, in that the rich are made low.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/caring-for-the-poor-and-needy.p59\" class=\"\">\u201cFor the earth is full, and there is enough and to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have given unto the children of men to be agents unto themselves.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15964\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15964)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15964)\">D&amp;C 104:14\u201317<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/caring-for-the-poor-and-needy.p60\" class=\"\">This puts the responsibility strictly upon us. The Lord has provided all we have. He has told us how to contribute to the care of his people, and he has given us our agency. We can do with it as we please, but he warns:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/caring-for-the-poor-and-needy.p61\" class=\"\">\u201cTherefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15966\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15966)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15966)\">D&amp;C 104:18<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/caring-for-the-poor-and-needy.p62\" class=\"\">As I understand it, \u201cthe law of [the] gospel\u201d by which we may today determine the portion of our \u201cabundance\u201d which we should impart \u201cunto the poor and the needy\u201d requires us to, first, pay an honest tithing; second, donate liberally to the fast offering funds; and third, make welfare contributions in labor and money.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/caring-for-the-poor-and-needy.p63\" class=\"\">Personally, I sincerely want to understand this law and comply with it, because I do not want to \u201cwith the wicked, lift up [my] eyes in hell, being in torment.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1973\/01\/caring-for-the-poor-and-needy.p64\" class=\"\">In the light of these scriptural teachings, it seems to me, brethren, that we should be thankful for our knowledge of the law and that we should faithfully obey it.
