When I was a young girl, the Young Women program and Mutual were an important part of my life. I loved my friends, the lessons we were taught, youth conferences, and camp. My leaders loved me and taught me the truths of the gospel. They served as second witnesses to the gospel principles my parents had taught. My parents, my bishop, and my dear Young Women leaders were \u201cexample[s] of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"117924\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 117924)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(117924)\">1\u00a0Timothy 4:12<\/a><\/span>).

I did not realize that my participation in each and every Church activity was helping me develop a lifelong pattern and commitment to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. I didn\u2019t understand that I was being prepared for my future life as an individual, a wife, a mother, and a leader. I didn\u2019t understand that as I tried to choose the right, I was honoring my baptismal covenants, exercising faith, increasing my virtue, and preparing to go to the temple. I couldn\u2019t see all of this then, but in very small, incremental steps, I was becoming a believer\u2014and \u201can example of the believers.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2009\/05\/be-thou-an-example-of-the-believers.p9\" class=\"\">Although we didn\u2019t have the Personal Progress program as you have it today, we did have a very similar program.
