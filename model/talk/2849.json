It gave me an opportunity to read a few books, and I read my patriarchal blessing and the blessings that I received from presidents of the Church when I was set apart as mission president twice; when I was set apart as the Presiding Bishop of the Church; and last of all when President David O. McKay, assisted by his counselors and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve, laid his hands upon my head twenty-four years ago last April in the holy temple and ordained me an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-simplicity-in-christ.p5\" class=\"\">In the blessing, President McKay gave me a charge that I should be a witness of Him, and that I should bear witness of His divine calling and the divine calling of His prophet Joseph Smith and of the truths of the restored gospel.

I have had great joy and happiness therein.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-simplicity-in-christ.p6\" class=\"\">I have come to feel the meaning of the words of the prophet Nephi when he said: \u201c[The Lord] hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3962\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3962)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3962)\">2 Ne. 4:21<\/a><\/span>.)

Think of that! Their minds were confused and corrupted or else they would have followed the simple teachings of the scriptures and there would have been no need of their spending four weeks in debate to decide that question. Thank the Lord that, through the restoration of the gospel, those simple truths are a part of us and of our great work, and our minds are not corrupted.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-simplicity-in-christ.p16\" class=\"\">I will give you another little illustration of what I mean. When I was doing missionary work back in Massachusetts some years ago, and it was near Easter time, I had a conversation in the home of a retired minister. I asked him if he would explain to me his concept of the Deity. He told of the universal feeling and the teachings of the churches, that he believed that the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost were one God, but a spiritual God\u2014not a physical God\u2014that there was an influence that permeated the earth, the life of the flowers and the trees and so forth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-simplicity-in-christ.p17\" class=\"\">Then I said: \u201cWell, what are they celebrating Easter for?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-simplicity-in-christ.p18\" class=\"\">And he said: \u201cThe resurrection of Christ.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-simplicity-in-christ.p19\" class=\"\">And I said: \u201cAnd just what do you mean by that?

Then He took fish and honeycomb and ate with them.

How could He stand on His right side or right hand if He had no body? How could He stand if He had no feet? Then compare this also with the marvelous vision of the Prophet Joseph in this dispensation when a light descended from heaven, according to his testimony, brighter than the noonday sun. In the midst of that glorious light were two heavenly messengers: the Father and the Son. The Father, pointing to the Son, said: \u201cThis is My Beloved Son.

A few years ago when Brother John A. Widtsoe was alive, he gave a series of lectures on the Doctrine and Covenants in the Barrett Hall, and Sister Richards and I attended those lectures. He had Sister Inez Witbeck there\u2014she could read beautifully\u2014and he would say, \u201cSister Witbeck, read section so-and-so,\u201d and then request certain verses from another section. Then he would stand up and say: \u201cNow you college students, you college professors, could you write anything like that?\u201d Then he would add: \u201cI wish I could.\u201d And he had been president of two universities and written textbooks that had been used all over the land. This church has produced many great leaders in finance, industry, and education, but none of them have attempted to contribute what the Prophet Joseph gave although he had scarcely seen the inside of a schoolroom.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-simplicity-in-christ.p28\" class=\"\">In the early days he surrounded himself with many wise men\u2014men who had had college training. Some of them thought that they could write revelations better than the Prophet Joseph did. So the Lord gave them a test. He told the prophet to choose the wisest among them and let him write a revelation equal to the least of those that the Lord had given through the Prophet Joseph, and if he was successful in so doing he would be under no condemnation if he failed to bear witness of the truth of the revelations He had given through the prophet. But none of them could do it. As I say, smart as our leaders are and have been, none of them can hope to approximate what the Prophet Joseph gave.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/11\/the-simplicity-in-christ.p29\" class=\"\">My testimony is that no man has ever lived upon the face of the earth outside of the Redeemer of the world that has given as much revealed truth to the world as the Prophet Joseph Smith.
