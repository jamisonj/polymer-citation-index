Since President Benson is unable to be with us in person, I respond to his invitation to speak in his behalf. For the most part, I will present his actual words.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-temple-of-the-lord.p5\" class=\"\">Last Wednesday, President Hinckley and I had a most delightful visit with President Benson. He greeted us warmly, flashed that friendly smile all of us love, and made us feel most welcome. When President Hinckley outlined the plans for conference and asked the President if it was his wish that we go forward with the arrangements and extend his love to all, he responded with a resounding, \u201cYes!\u201d We understand his concerns. We share his love, and we bring to you his blessings. This giant of the Lord merits our constant prayers and our abiding faith.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-temple-of-the-lord.p6\" class=\"\">On Friday, March 26, Sister Monson and I attended and participated in the ribbon-cutting ceremony formally opening a truly magnificent exhibit in the museum west of Temple Square. It is entitled \u201cThe Mountain of the Lord\u2019s House\u201d and depicts the fascinating forty-year saga required for the construction of the Salt Lake Temple. Where possible, I urge all of you to see the exhibit and feel the spirit it conveys. Tuesday, April 6, the Salt Lake Temple will have a birthday. One hundred years will have passed since that glorious day when it was dedicated.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-temple-of-the-lord.p7\" class=\"\">While visiting the exhibit, a reporter asked me the question, \u201cWould President Benson like this exhibit?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-temple-of-the-lord.p8\" class=\"\">I answered, \u201cHe would love it!\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-temple-of-the-lord.p9\" class=\"\">President Benson has always loved temples and temple work. When he felt better, each Friday he and Sister Benson would enter the temple to participate in a session. We knew our First Presidency meeting that morning must accommodate this commitment. One morning I commented that I had to get busy and do some of my own family names that were prepared. With a smile and a twinkle in his eye, the President said, \u201cBrother Monson, if you\u2019re too busy, why not let Sister Benson and me do your names for you.\u201d Needless to say, we found time to do the work ourselves.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-temple-of-the-lord.p10\" class=\"\">President Benson\u2019s own expressions indicate this love for temples. He reflected:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-temple-of-the-lord.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cI remember \u2026 as a \u2026 boy, coming in from the field and approaching the old farm home. \u2026 I could hear my mother singing, \u2018Have I Done Any Good in the World Today?\u2019 (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1950, no. 58.) I can \u2026 see her in my mind\u2019s eye bending over the ironing board \u2026 with beads of perspiration on her forehead.\u201d She was ironing long strips of white cloth, with newspapers on the floor to keep them clean. \u201cWhen I asked her what she was doing, she said, \u2018These are temple robes, my son. Your father and I are going to the Logan Temple.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-temple-of-the-lord.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cThen she put the old flatiron on the stove, drew a chair close to mine, and told me about temple work\u2014how important it [was] to be able to go to the temple and participate in the sacred ordinances performed there. She also expressed her fervent hope that some day her children \u2026 grandchildren and great-grandchildren would have the opportunity to enjoy those priceless blessings.\u201d He continued: \u201cI am happy to say that her fondest hopes in large measure have been realized.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-93905_000_003\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Aug. 1985, p. 8.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-temple-of-the-lord.p13\" class=\"\">On another occasion, President Benson instructed us: \u201cSometimes in the peace of lovely temples, the serious problems of life find their solutions. [At times] pure knowledge flows to us there under the influence of the Spirit.\u201d Said he: \u201cI am grateful to the Lord for temples. The blessings of the House of the Lord are eternal. They are of the highest importance to us because it is in the temples that we obtain God\u2019s greatest blessings pertaining to eternal life. Temples really are the gateways to heaven.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-temple-of-the-lord.p14\" class=\"\">He said: \u201cMay we remember always, as we [visit and work in these glorious temples], that the veil may become very thin between this world and the spirit world. I know this is true.\u201d He declared, \u201cIt is well also that we keep in mind that it is all one great program on both sides of the veil and it is not too important whether we serve here or over there, as long as we serve with all our heart, might, mind, and strength.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-93905_000_003\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[\u201cTemple Memories,\u201d address given at Denver Colorado Temple dedication, 25 Oct. 1986.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1993\/05\/the-temple-of-the-lord.p15\" class=\"\">President Benson, your words are welcomed.
