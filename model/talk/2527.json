These are they who fully intend, someday, to begin to believe and\/or to be active in the Church. But not yet! These are not bad individuals, but good individuals who simply do not know how much better they could be. Such individuals often stay proximate to\u2014but do not participate fully in\u2014the Church. They will not come inside the chapel, but neither do they leave its porch.
