The engineer said, pointing up to the bright headlight, \u2018I want to tell you one thing: when I pull out of this station I won\u2019t be running in darkness one foot of the way. You see that light a thousand yards ahead? I run my engine just to the edge of the light, and when I get there it will still be on a thousand yards ahead.\u2019 Having said that, President McKay added: \u2018I want to tell you something. Through all this dark night of uncertainty, I want to tell you that this Welfare Program will not be running in the dark one foot of the way. You remember it. We can only see the next October as the first circle of light. We have told you what to do six months from now. By the time we get there the light will be on ahead of us, but every step of the way that light will be there. You teach your people to follow the light and they will be safe on Zion\u2019s hill when the destructive forces come in the world.\u2019\u201d (Welfare Agricultural Meeting, 5 Apr. 1969.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/preparation-for-tomorrow.p23\" class=\"\">If we will just do as the Brethren have counseled and live each day as it comes, providently and righteously, there will be no need for drastic adjustments in preparation to meet future challenges.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/preparation-for-tomorrow.p24\" class=\"\">I fear that many think the welfare services program was designed primarily for doomsday.

For instance, in one local daily newspaper, over two-thirds of the headlines and stories exposed problems of the world such as murders, wars, bankruptcies, unemployment, and so on, leaving very little room for stories with a positive impact. One might be persuaded that conditions are impossible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1982\/11\/preparation-for-tomorrow.p27\" class=\"\">It is true that we live in a troubled world.
