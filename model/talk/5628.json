Romney has told us that \u201cat the heart of society\u2019s fatal sickness is the instability of the family.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote1-95905_000_034\">1<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Feb. 1972, p. 57.]<\/span><\/sup> We recognize that some homes are large, graciously appointed, even luxurious. Others are very small and humble, with scant furnishings. Yet each and every \u201chome can be a heav\u2019n on earth when we are filled with love, \u2026 Where we want to be\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Hymns,<\/span> 1985, no. 298), as one of our beloved hymns reminds us.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/a-table-encircled-with-love.p4\" class=\"\">One of the more important furnishings found in most homes is the kitchen table. Now it may be small, it may be large, or in the form of a little counter with barely room to put the food and utensils. Its major function seems to be a place for the different members of the family to receive nourishment.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/a-table-encircled-with-love.p5\" class=\"\">On this special occasion, my desire is to bring your attention to a deeper, more important function for the kitchen table, where we can receive much more than nourishment for our physical well-being.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/a-table-encircled-with-love.p6\" class=\"\">A family generally has two or more members of differing ages, but the family needs to meet\u2014preferably not only just to eat, but to pray, to talk, to listen, to relate, to learn, to grow together. President Gordon B. Hinckley has stated it so well: \u201cMy plea\u2014and I wish I were more eloquent in voicing it\u2014is a plea to save the children. Too many of them walk with pain and fear, in loneliness and despair. Children need sunlight. They need happiness. They need love and nurture. They need kindness and refreshment and affection. Every home, regardless of the cost of the house, can provide an environment of love which will be an environment of salvation.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-95905_000_034\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign,<\/span> Nov. 1994, p. 54.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/a-table-encircled-with-love.p7\" class=\"\">Most family members are subjected to the many forces of the world outside of the home, as well as the powerful influence of radio, television, videos, tapes, and many other things which we bring into our homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/a-table-encircled-with-love.p8\" class=\"\">Picture a family gathering around a table, perhaps the kitchen table, talking about the gospel, talking about the sacrament meetings, the messages, talking about the current <span class=\"emphasis\">Ensign<\/span> or the current <span class=\"emphasis\">New Era,<\/span> talking about school with all of its ramifications, talking about general conference, talking about the Sunday School lessons, listening to good music, talking about Jesus Christ and his teachings. The list could be expanded. Not only parents, but all family members would be wise to make certain that each person present has a chance to talk and ample opportunity to participate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/a-table-encircled-with-love.p9\" class=\"\">Think of the potential of a family kneeling around a table (without television), praying, pleading for help, thanking our Father for blessings\u2014teaching all ages the importance of a loving Father in Heaven. Family prayer with little ones may well develop older ones who someday will pray with their families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/a-table-encircled-with-love.p10\" class=\"\">President Thomas S. Monson stated it well: \u201cThe Lord directed that we have family prayer when he said: \u2018Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed\u2019 (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"6380\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 6380)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(6380)\">3 Ne. 18:21<\/a><\/span>).<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/a-table-encircled-with-love.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cWill you join me as we look in on a typical Latter-day Saint family offering prayers unto the Lord? Father, mother, and each of the children kneel, bow their heads, and close their eyes. A sweet spirit of love, unity, and peace fills the home. As a father hears his tiny son pray unto God that his dad will do the right things and be obedient to the Lord\u2019s bidding, do you think that such a father would find it difficult to honor the prayer of his precious son? As a teenage daughter hears her sweet mother plead unto the Lord that her daughter will be inspired in the selection of her companions, that she will prepare herself for a temple marriage, don\u2019t you believe that such a daughter will seek to honor this humble, pleading petition of her mother whom she so dearly loves? When father, mother, and each of the children earnestly pray that these fine sons in the family will live worthy that they may in due time receive a call to serve as ambassadors of the Lord in the mission fields of the Church, don\u2019t we begin to see how such sons grow to young manhood with an overwhelming desire to serve as missionaries?\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote3-95905_000_034\">3<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"emphasis\">Pathways to Perfection<\/span> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1973), p. 26.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/a-table-encircled-with-love.p12\" class=\"\">As many have said, \u201cHow could you possibly send your parents and your children out into the world each day without gathering together and talking to the Lord?\u201d Wise parents will examine their schedules and plan at least one time daily to gather the family for the blessings of prayer. Very soon, young members learn how to take their turn and learn the precious values found in family prayer.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1995\/05\/a-table-encircled-with-love.p13\" class=\"\">I have stated before that \u201chome should be a happy place because all work to keep it that way. It is said that happiness is homemade, and we should endeavor to make our homes happy and pleasant places for us and our children.
