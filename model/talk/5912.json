The work of a mother is hard, too often unheralded work. The young years are often those when either husband or wife\u2014or both\u2014may still be in school or in those earliest and leanest stages of developing the husband\u2019s breadwinning capacities. Finances fluctuate daily between low and nonexistent. The apartment is usually decorated in one of two smart designs\u2014Deseret Industries provincial or early Mother Hubbard. The car, if there is one, runs on smooth tires and an empty tank. But with night feedings and night teethings, often the greatest challenge of all for a young mother is simply fatigue. Through these years, mothers go longer on less sleep and give more to others with less personal renewal for themselves than any other group I know at any other time in life. It is not surprising when the shadows under their eyes sometimes vaguely resemble the state of Rhode Island.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/because-she-is-a-mother.p12\" class=\"\">Of course the irony is that this is often the sister we want to call\u2014or need to call\u2014to service in the ward and stake auxiliaries. That\u2019s understandable. Who wouldn\u2019t want the exemplary influence of these young Loises- and Eunices-in-the-making? Everyone, be wise. Remember that families are the highest priority of all, especially in those formative years. Even so, young mothers will still find magnificent ways to serve faithfully in the Church, even as others serve and strengthen them and their families in like manner.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/because-she-is-a-mother.p13\" class=\"\">Do the best you can through these years, but whatever else you do, cherish that role that is so uniquely yours and for which heaven itself sends angels to watch over you and your little ones. Husbands\u2014especially husbands\u2014as well as Church leaders and friends in every direction, be helpful and sensitive and wise. Remember, \u201cTo every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-97905_000_018\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[<span class=\"citation\" id=\"21454\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 21454)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(21454)\">Eccl. 3:1<\/a><\/span>.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/because-she-is-a-mother.p14\" class=\"\">Mothers, we acknowledge and esteem your faith in every footstep.

One was that whenever she heard talks on LDS motherhood, she worried because she felt she didn\u2019t measure up or somehow wasn\u2019t going to be equal to the task. Secondly, she felt like the world expected her to teach her children reading, writing, interior design, Latin, calculus, and the Internet\u2014all before the baby said something terribly ordinary, like \u201cgoo goo.\u201d Thirdly, she often felt people were sometimes patronizing, almost always without meaning to be, because the advice she got or even the compliments she received seemed to reflect nothing of the mental investment, the spiritual and emotional exertion, the long-night, long-day, stretched-to-the-limit demands that sometimes are required in trying to be and wanting to be the mother God hopes she will be.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/because-she-is-a-mother.p16\" class=\"\">But one thing, she said, keeps her going: \u201cThrough the thick and the thin of this, and through the occasional tears of it all, <span class=\"emphasis\">I know deep down inside I am doing God\u2019s work.<\/span> I know that in my motherhood I am in an eternal partnership with Him. I am deeply moved that God finds His ultimate purpose and meaning in being a parent, even if some of His children make Him weep.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/because-she-is-a-mother.p17\" class=\"\">\u201cIt is this realization,\u201d she says, \u201cthat I try to recall on those inevitably difficult days when all of this can be a bit overwhelming. Maybe it is precisely our inability and anxiousness that urge us to reach out to Him and enhance His ability to reach back to us. Maybe He secretly hopes we <span class=\"emphasis\">will<\/span> be anxious,\u201d she said, \u201cand <span class=\"emphasis\">will<\/span> plead for His help. Then, I believe, He can teach these children directly, through us, but with no resistance offered. I like that idea,\u201d she concludes. \u201cIt gives me hope. If I can be right before my Father in Heaven, perhaps His guidance to our children can be unimpeded. Maybe then it can be <span class=\"emphasis\">His<\/span> work and <span class=\"emphasis\">His<\/span> glory in a very literal sense.\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote7-97905_000_018\">7<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Personal correspondence.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/because-she-is-a-mother.p18\" class=\"\">In light of that kind of expression, it is clear that some of those Rhode Island\u2013sized shadows come not just from diapers and carpooling but from at least a few sleepless nights spent searching the soul, seeking earnestly for the capacity to raise these children to be what God wants them to be. Moved by that kind of devotion and determination, may I say to mothers collectively, in the name of the Lord, you are magnificent. You are doing terrifically well. The very fact that you have been given such a responsibility is everlasting evidence of the trust your Father in Heaven has in you. He knows that your giving birth to a child does not immediately propel you into the circle of the omniscient. If you and your husband will strive to love God and live the gospel yourselves; if you will plead for that guidance and comfort of the Holy Spirit promised to the faithful; if you will go to the temple to both make and claim the promises of the most sacred covenants a woman or man can make in this world; if you will show others, including your children, the same caring, compassionate, forgiving heart you want heaven to show you; if you try your best to be the best parent you can be, you will have done all that a human being can do and all that God expects you to do.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1997\/05\/because-she-is-a-mother.p19\" class=\"\">Sometimes the decision of a child or a grandchild will break your heart.
