As I speak tonight I desire to remind us of the importance of magnifying our callings in the priesthood.

By the same token, we are charged with the greatest responsibility. We should diligently try\u2014through prayer, study, and the faithful performance of our priesthood duties\u2014to learn all we can about the priesthood. Even so, we will not be able, in mortal life, to fully comprehend it. We can, however, understand that priesthood is power\u2014the power of God. By means of the priesthood he exercises, God the Father brings into existence and governs all of his creations. President Brigham Young said that \u201cthe Priesthood of the Son of God \u2026 is the law by which the worlds are, were, and will continue for ever and ever. It is that system which brings worlds into existence and peoples them, gives them their revolutions\u2014their days, weeks, months, years, their seasons and times and by which they are rolled up as a scroll, as it were, and go into a higher state of existence.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Discourses of Brigham Young,<\/span> sel.
