To that I agree. It\ngives me great pleasure to look into the faces of men and women whose lives are clean; who\nhave faith in God; who have made covenants to serve. President Smith further says that\nsalvation comes through the keeping of the commandments of God. We do not believe that\nsalvation comes from lip service, merely a confession with our lips that Jesus is the Christ. It\ncomes through obedience to every principle and eternal truth pertaining to our exaltation. Let\nme read to you words of the Lord given to his disciples on this continent as he stood in their\npresence.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd it shall come to pass, that who so repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be\nfilled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father\nat that day when I shall stand to judge the world.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also\nhewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no more return, because of\nthe justice of the Author.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd this is the word which he hath given unto the children of men. And for this cause\nhe fulfilleth the words which he hath given, and he lath not, but fulfilleth all his\nwords.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing untruth into his\nrest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their\nfaith, and the repentance of all their sins and their faithfulness unto the end\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"5508\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 5508)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(5508)\">3 Ne. 27:16-19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThese words that I have read to you are from the twenty-seventh chapter of 3 Nephi, verses\n16-19 inclusive.\n<\/p><p>\nLAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE\n<\/p><p>\nOne of my great sorrows is that so many members of the Church fail to recognize this truth\nwhich I have read. We are not going to be saved in the kingdom of God just because our\nnames are on the records of the Church. It will require more than that. We will have to have\nour names written in the Lamb's Book of Life, and if they are written in the Lamb's book of\nLife then it is an evidence we have kept the commandments. Every soul who will not keep\nthose commandments shall have his name blotted out of that book\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"8899\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 8899)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(8899)\">Alma 5:57<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWORLD REJECTS BLESSINGS\n<\/p><p>\nI am exceedingly grateful this morning for the knowledge which I have, limited as it is, of the\ngospel of Jesus Christ; of the things that have been revealed for our salvation: for the\nopportunities which come to us to give service to the Church and to our fellow men. We have\nso many blessings that the world does not have. The world could have them, but it will not.\nAs the Savior said, speaking particularly of the Jews, many a time would he have gathered\nthem as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, but they would not\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"34370\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 34370)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(34370)\">Matt. 23:37<\/a><\/span>). I wish that every\nhonest soul in this world would read the Book of Mormon; would read the Doctrine and\nCovenants, the Pearl of Great Price, besides reading the Bible. What a glorious privilege is\nours. The so-called Christian world, divided and subdivided maintains that the Bible contains\nall of the word of God\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3527\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3527)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3527)\">2 Ne. 28:29<\/a><\/span>;\n<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3528\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3528)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3528)\">2 Ne. 29:6<\/a><\/span>).\nTo them the Lord has never given a revelation. According to its\nteachings nothing has come from the heavens by way of counsel and advice or revelation,\ncomparable to that which we find in what they are pleased to call the canon of scripture.\n<\/p><p>\nNot long ago, as I was on the train coming home, a minister said to me that the Book of\nMormon was a fraud because in the last chapter of the book of Revelation the Lord so\ndeclared it. Let me read those words.\n<\/p><p>\nAnd if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God\nshall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the\nthings which are written in this book\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"42213\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 42213)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(42213)\">Rev. 22:19<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nI said to him, \"My good friend, don't you know that when that was written we had no Bible?\"\nThis Bible was not compiled as we have it when that was written. That has reference merely\nto this Book of Revelation. Then he was sorry that he had spoken. Well, all they have is what\nis contained in this book (the Bible), this record that closed nearly two thousand years ago.\n<\/p><p>\nADVANTAGES ENJOYED\n<\/p><p>\nSee the advantage, brethren and sisters, that we have. Not only do we have the revelations\ngiven to the prophets of ancient Israel, given by our Savior when he was on the earth and by\nhis disciples in that first century, but the Lord has continued to speak; he has given many\nrevelations to others. We have them. We are blessed with the Book of Mormon which\ncontains the principles of the gospel so clearly stated, that we do not stumble over them. We\nhave the Doctrine and Covenants, which is our book particularly, containing the revelations\ngiven to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and to all the world if it will have\nthem. This book isn't just for us, but we have it. The world won't have it. See what it could\nhave if it would. It could have information, knowledge and wisdom pertaining to the salvation\nof men, that can't be found in the Bible. I have said, and I think I am right, that there isn't\none principle pertaining to the salvation of men that is so clearly stated in the Bible, as it has\ncome down to us, that men do not stumble over&mdash;not one thing. There is not one principle\nthey can be united on that has been so clearly stated that they don't find their interpretations\nof it conflicting.\n<\/p><p>\nTHE VISION\n<\/p><p>\nDo you want to know about the resurrection of the dead? Who is going to be saved in the\ncelestial kingdom of God? Then read your Book of Mormon. Read your Doctrine and\nCovenants. The seventy-sixth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, known as The Vision\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12803\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12803)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12803)\">D&amp;C 76:1-119<\/a><\/span>), is\nthe clearest, most concise statement regarding salvation that I know anything about, and I\ndoubt if the Lord ever gave to any people at any time upon the face of the earth anything\nclearer than this revelation. Do the people of the world know where they are going when they\ndie? No. They sing about a beautiful isle of somewhere. They don't know. Can they find out\nin the Bible? Yes, we can find it. They could find it if they had the right inspiration, but with\nthe added help that we obtain from the records the Lord has given us, we don't stumble over\nthat. We don't stumble over baptism and how it should be performed and by whom. We have\na clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God. Now, I can find that in the Bible; so\ncan you. So can they, if they would search for it in the spirit of faith; but they stumble over\nit; and yet they are not willing to accept the revelations of the Lord given in\nthe day and dispensation in which they live that would set forth clearly to them all these\nprinciples of eternal truth. How greatly are we blessed!\n<\/p><p>\nBOOK OF MORMON\n<\/p><p>\nThen I have this regret, that so many members of the Church do not avail themselves\nof this information. The Lord was kind enough and so deeply concerned in the matter that he\nsent an angel from his presence to reveal the Book of Mormon. For ages he prepared the\nBook of Mormon that it might come forth to the convincing, it says, of both Jew and Gentile\nand the remnant upon this land, that Jesus is the Christ\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"43124\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 43124)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(43124)\">BM Title Page<\/a><\/span>). It was to come forth in a day when\nmen would be denying the Christ. Isn't that true? Is not the world today getting farther and\nfarther away from a knowledge concerning the Son of God? Are not the peoples of the earth\nbeginning, if they have not already reached the point, to deny the literal resurrection of the\nbody and are questioning the resurrection of the Lord himself and his godhood? The Book of\nMormon said that would be the case and that it was to come forth as a testimony, as a witness\nto men that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Redeemer of the World, and that men will be\nsaved and exalted in the kingdom of God by keeping their hearts pure and obeying all of his\ncommandments. These things the Lord has impressed upon us.\n<\/p><p>\nCOVENANT AT BAPTISM\n<\/p><p>\nIn conclusion let me read the covenant we make when we are baptized and come into this\nChurch.\n<\/p><p>\nAll those who humble themselves before God and desire to be baptized, and come\nforth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and witness before the church that they\nhave truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the name of\nJesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end, and truly manifest by\ntheir works that they have received of the spirit of Christ unto the remission of their\nsins, shall be received by baptism into his church\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"12775\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 12775)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(12775)\">D&amp;C 20:37<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nWhat do you get out of that? I get this: that every soul baptized, truly baptized, has humbled\nhimself; his heart is broken: his spirit is contrite; he has made a covenant before God that he\nwill keep his commandments, and he has forsaken all his sins. Then after he gets into the\nChurch, is it his privilege to sin after he is in? Can he let down? Can he indulge in some of\nthe things which the Lord has said he should avoid? No. It is just as necessary that he have\nthat contrite spirit, that broken heart, after he is baptized as it is before.\n<\/p><p>\nPOWER TO REACH MEMBERS\n<\/p><p>\nOh, I wish we had the power, we who hold the priesthood, to reach every soul who is not\nfaithful, who is not humbled in his heart&mdash;members of this Church&mdash;that\nwe might bring them back to a full understanding of the gospel. Is it true that some among us\nhave an idea that it matters not that we sin so long as it is not a grievous sin, a deadly sin,\nthat we will yet be saved in the kingdom of God? Nephi saw our day. He said that people\nwould be saying that (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"3523\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 3523)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(3523)\">2 Ne. 28:8<\/a><\/span>).\nBut I say unto you, we cannot turn away from the path of truth and\nrighteousness and retain the guidance of the Spirit of the Lord.\n<\/p><p>\nMay the Lord bless the Latter-day Saints. May he bless all people. Oh, I wish that we would\nall humble ourselves and seek the truth which the Lord has declared to us by his own word in\nthis day in which we live. The Lord bless us all, help us to be true and faithful and keep his\ncommandments, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
