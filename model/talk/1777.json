I know\nthat many of the problems you deal with, many of the most difficult ones, involve homes and\nfamilies, and it is of this that I would like to speak this afternoon. Few other subjects seem to me\nso urgently important in our time or to have such eternal relevance.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>The home and family<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nI speak to those who have children at home, and to those who have influence in homes where\nthere are children, as well as to the great generation, represented by this marvelous [Logan\nInstitute of Religion] chorus, who are making decisions now that will effectively influence their\nfuture homes and families.\n<\/p><p>\nIn offering my witness about the home and family, I renew my expression of deep respect for\nchildren who wisely choose the better way, often in improvement upon their parents, and my\ndeep compassion for good parents who strive earnestly to bring up their children in the way they\nshould go, only to have those children use their individuality and agency to follow other ways.\nThe Lord has forcefully taught us that in his eyes \"the son shall not bear the iniquity of the\nfather, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"23142\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 23142)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(23142)\">Ezek. 18:20<\/a><\/span>) Each accountable\nperson must ultimately answer for his own decisions.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is our individual responsibility, parent or child or parent-to-be, to make decisions that will\nimprove upon the quality of our homes and our relationships within them, and each of us should\nbe anxious and honest in his efforts to do that&mdash;each of us.\n<\/p><p>\nIt has been written: \"As are families, so is society. If well ordered, well instructed, and well\ngoverned, they are the springs from which go forth the streams of national greatness and\nprosperity&mdash;of civil order and public happiness.\" (Thayer.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"Set in order your houses\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIn the early days of the restoration, the leaders of the Church were instructed to \"set in order your\nhouses.\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15614\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15614)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15614)\">D&amp;C 90:18<\/a><\/span>) The Lord gave clear and explicit instructions to the brethren and certainly to all the\nmembers of the Church that they be \"more diligent and concerned at home, and pray always\"\n(<span class=\"citation\" id=\"15621\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 15621)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(15621)\">D&amp;C 93:50<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThe wise men of the world have added their witness to the importance of doing this. Let me\nquote one, Martin Buber: \n<\/p><p>\n\"If we had power over the ends of the earth it would not give us that fulfillment of existence\nwhich a quiet, devoted relationship to nearby life can give us. If we knew the secrets of the upper\nworlds, they would not allow us so much actual participation in true existence as we can achieve\nby performing with holy intent a task belonging to our daily duties. Our treasure is hidden\nbeneath the hearth of our own home.\"\n<\/p><p>\nIt is on this strong affirmation, which I believe with all my heart, that I offer five specific\nsuggestions as to how we may find and multiply the treasures hidden beneath the hearth of our\nown home.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Family associations<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFirst let me mention <i>family associations<\/i>.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat other families does your family know well? What other fathers and mothers do they see in\naction? Do your children ever sit at the table or in family home evening, or kneel in prayer with\nanother family?\n<\/p><p>\nParents should be deeply concerned to build friendships with other families who have\nwholesome ideals, whose family life is constructive and strong. Children can greatly profit\nthrough exposure to other homes, parents, and families where there is good disposition, pleasant\nattitude, good fun, good humor, good literature, respect and discipline, and cleanliness and\nprayer; where there is devotion to serving the Lord; where the gospel is lived.\n<\/p><p>\nWith children, as all of us know, life is often a matter of following the leader, and wise parents\nwill want their children to enjoy the influence of other families whose convictions and example\nwill offer them strong incentives to build happy relationships in their own homes.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Wonderful neighborhoods<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nAs parents we have been very grateful for the wonderful neighborhoods in which we have been\nprivileged to live, and for the strong families in whose homes our children have visited as friends\nor baby tenders. Many religions and viewpoints are represented among our neighbors, and our\nchildren have profited greatly and have been greatly strengthened in their gratitude for their own\nhome and faith from seeing the quality of the homes and families of the good people among\nwhom we are privileged to live.\n<\/p><p>\nAcross the street, for instance, is a wonderful Latter-day Saint family into whose home I have\nalways been grateful to have my youngsters go. The mother is a warm, gracious friend and\nhomemaker whose surroundings reflect her own character. Her husband is a special kind of man\nwho has inspired our children and others in the neighborhood with his creative efforts to\nencourage patriotism and learning and appreciation of our historical heritage. There have been\ncontests and essays and quizzes, serious celebrations along with the parties and fun on special\nholidays.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Family traditions<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThat leads me to the second suggestion. Families thrive on <i>traditions<\/i> and the <i>special rituals<\/i> of\nfamily life. Celebrating special days and seasons in special ways, working together, enjoying\nfamily home evenings and family councils and conversations, deciding upon and preparing for\nand enjoying holidays together, family meals and prayers&mdash;there are so many significant ways to\nbuild family traditions that will be remembered.\n<\/p><p>\nWith all else that is sacred about Christmas, for instance, it can mean a beloved white star on the\nchimney that symbolizes the season. It may also mean that special time together on Christmas\nEve, carols sung at each home in the neighborhood, up and down the block, fun and music, and\nthe involvement of others from outside the home. Everyone participates, but especially the\nguests who share the experience, who take part, who read and contribute some special thought of\nChristmas. The Bible teaches us that we must not be forgetful to entertain strangers, for in so\ndoing many have entertained angels unaware. (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"24404\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 24404)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(24404)\">Heb. 13:2<\/a><\/span>) The custom of having honored guests with us in\nour home has given us that experience every year for many years at Christmas and other times.\n<\/p><p>\nLet me be personal enough to mention that the choicest memories of recent years, as we talk of\nritual or celebration at our home, are the times we prepared as a family to bid a precious child\nfarewell on her way to school. We celebrated the sad\/happy event and joined our hearts together\nas the head of the home gave her a father's blessing and invoked the Spirit of the Lord upon her.\nTwice we have had that glorious privilege, and pray God that we may enjoy it with each child.\n<\/p><p>\nIt is of such simple but significant things that family traditions are built, and unified families with\nthem.\n<\/p><p>\nAll of us turn reflectively to the sweet memories of our childhood at home, and each of us, now\nblessed with families or looking forward to that privilege, should he thinking about the\nmemories we will provide for their future.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Family values<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nThird, let me mention <i>family values<\/i>. What gets major attention in our homes? What do we really\ncare about, take time for? What is worthy of our consideration, our attention, our money, our\nefforts? What of books and reading them? What of thoughtful acts of kindness, of sharing,\ninvolving the whole family within and without the home? What of prayer, conversation genuine\nconcern with each other?\n<\/p><p>\nIn 1926 <i>The Improvement Era<\/i> carried a memorable statement by a college senior concerning\nthoughts of home and relationships there. Let me read what he wrote about his good home: \n<\/p><p>\n\"1. I wish I could remember one Fourth of July, or one circus day, or one canyon trip, in which\nmy father had joined us boys, instead of giving us the money and equipment to go, while he and\nmother stayed home, and made us feel guilty by working while we played.\n<\/p><p>\n\"2. I wish I could remember one evening when he had joined us in singing, or reading, or\ntussling, instead of always sitting so quietly with his newspaper by the reading lamp.\n<\/p><p>\n\"3. I wish I could remember one month, or week, or day even, when he had made purposeful\nwork out of drudgery by planning the farm work with us, instead of merely announcing each\nmorning what that day's work would be.\n<\/p><p>\n\"4. I wish I could remember one Sunday when he had bundled us all into the buggy and taken all\nto church together, instead of staying home while we went in the morning, and leaving us home\nwhile he and mother went in the afternoon.\n<\/p><p>\n\"5. I wish that I could remember just one talk in which we had discussed together the problems\nand facts that trouble every growing boy, on which his clear and vigorous viewpoint might have\nshed such light and comfort, instead of leaving me to pick up the facts haphazardly as I might\nand to solve the problems as best I could.\n<\/p><p>\n\"And yet, my conscience would cry shame were I to blame him, for no man could ever be more\ndevoted to his family, more anxious for their welfare, I more proud of their successes. His\nexample has been a beacon to us. He just didn't know&mdash;and there is the pity of it to me&mdash;he just\ndidn't know that we needed <i>him<\/i>. He didn't know that ye would rather have his companionship\nthan the land he could leave us&mdash;that some day, maybe we might make money for ourselves, but\nthat never can we make for ourselves the memories that might have enriched and mellowed and\nmolded our lives. I can't see a Fathers and Sons' outing without a lump in my throat.\" (<i>Era<\/i>,\nDecember 1926, p. 145.)\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Discipline in the home<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFourth, I speak of <i>discipline<\/i>&mdash;discipline in the home; and of course I am not talking about harsh\npunishments but of fair rules, understood and enforced, with sanctions consistently imposed\nwhen they are broken. I am thinking of realities, of facts to be faced, of a future of attitudes\ntoward law and rules and personal responsibility being learned. Samuel Johnson, the great\nBritish literary genius, said that he would never permit his children to \"deny him\"&mdash;that is, to\ndeny to callers that he was at home when he was, busy as he was. He said, \"If I teach my children\nto lie for me, I may be sure that they will soon conceive the notion of lying to me.\"\n<\/p><p>\nDiscipline involves adult solutions to the problems that arise in living together. Wise parents do\nnot subject each other or their children to emotional poisoning. Disagreements are handled\nmaturely and constructively and not destructively.\n<\/p><p>\nDiscipline begins with concern and commitment and example, like that other word that comes\nfrom the same root: disciple.\n<\/p><p>\nChildren need standards, need guidelines of behavior, and limits. They need models who care,\nwho are firm and fair and sensitive and consistent. Wholesome discipline can he gentle and\nsensitive, but often it isn't.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Interest of wonderful mother<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nA daughter and I were recently discussing her return home at an hour that seemed questionable\nto me. I shared with her an experience with my wonderful mother. I had spent some years away\nat schools and missions and wars, and the two of us were now alone at home. I returned from an\nappointment one evening at midnight to find the light still on in Mother's little bedroom. As I\nhad always done, I reported in to Mom, sat on her bed, and kidded with her a little. I asked her\nwhy she was still awake. \"I am waiting for you,\" she said.\n<\/p><p>\nI said, \"Did you wait for me while I was on a mission, Mom, or at sea, or in battle?\"\n<\/p><p>\nHer answer was calm and sweet. She gave me that little pat on the knee that reflects the mature\ncompassion of the wise for the ignorant, and said: \"No, that would have been foolish. I just knelt\ndown here by my bed and talked to the Lord about my boy. I told him what kind of man I\nbelieved you to be and wanted you to be, and prayed for his watchful care of you, and then left\nyou in his hands and went to sleep. But now you are home,\" she said, \"and you can count on it\nthat I will be interested in you as long as I live.\"\n<\/p><p>\nShe is gone now, and it is remarkable how often I get the feeling that she is interested still, and\nforever will be.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Family love<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nFinally I mention <i>family love<\/i>, expressed in so many wonderful ways. Someone once said&mdash;it's\nbeen often quoted&mdash;that the best thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother. I\nbelieve this, and that the strongest and surest base for loving others is to love the Lord and to\nbring the binding and blessing balm of that love into all relationships of the home.\n<\/p><p>\nChildren have the right to learn that love is the foundation of a good family, and that love cannot\nexist apart from such qualities as respect, consideration, responsibility, and loyalty. Love is not\nself-centered and is not self-serving, but is concerned with the well-being and happiness of\nothers. It is providing for our loved ones an atmosphere of warmth and kindness that accepts and\npreserves the uniqueness of each as an individual person while building the unity of the home.\n<\/p><p>\nLove means friendship and companionship and partnership and unity. It expresses itself in\nmodesty, in generosity, in sensitivity, in courtesy, in counsel, in appropriate compromise. It\ninspires affection and confidence and trust and self-control. Love, mature love, provides a\nclimate of wholesome, repentant, forgiving consideration. It listens. It hears and senses the needs\nof another. It can never be separated from character, from unselfishness, from good humor, and\nfrom every tender virtue.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Make the effort<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nIt must be strongly said of each of these avenues to family felicity that it does not just\n<i>happen<\/i>&mdash;it must be brought about by people who think and care and make the effort.\n<\/p><p>\nGod help us to be more concerned with a high standard of life than with a high standard of\nliving. God help us, while there is time, to take time to do everything we can to bring about now,\nor in the family we will one day have, by making wise choices now, the unity and strength and\nsweetness that a home is meant to have. I believe we can do that, or materially move toward\nbringing it about, through thoughtful family associations, memorable traditions, correct values,\nwise discipline and great love.\n<\/p><p>\nWhat will we give our children to remember?\n<\/p><p>\nIt is likely that what they will remember best is the treasure we unearth from beneath the hearth\nof our own home.\n<\/p><p>\nI know the gospel is true, and that it has been restored, and that it centers in the home. God bless\nus to strengthen the home, in Jesus' name. Amen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
