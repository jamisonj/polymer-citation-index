Packer, <i>Conference Report<\/i>, October 1966, pp. 131-133<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"gcbody\">\n<p>\nMy dear brethren and sisters: We are greatly pleased to be in the mission field. In trying to\nconvey to you that feeling, the best I can do is to tell you that when it comes to missionary\nwork we feel just the way Elder LeGrand Richards sounds. We appreciate deeply the\nopportunity to serve in the New England Mission. We are amazed at the great power and\nstrength of the missionaries. We stand in awe of the Latter-day Saint missionary.\n<\/p><p>\nA few days ago the general authorities assembled in the upper room of the temple to prepare\nfor general conference.\n<\/p><p>\nPresident McKay admonished us to feel free, perfectly free, uninhibited. From this invitation I\napproach with reverence a subject I had theretofore not intended to pursue.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"I'm a person\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nSome years ago two of our little boys were wrestling on the rug before the fireplace. They\nhad reached the pitch&mdash;you know the one&mdash;where laughter turns to tears and play becomes a\nstruggle. I worked a foot gently between them and lifted the older boy (then just four years of\nage? to a sitting position on the rug, saying, \"Hey there, you monkey, you had better settle\ndown.\" He folded his little arms and looked at me with surprising seriousness. His little boy\nfeelings had been hurt, and he protested, \"I not a monkey, Daddy&mdash;I a person.\n<\/p><p>\nI thought how deeply I loved him, how much I wanted him to be \"a person\"&mdash;one of eternal\nworth. For \"children are an heritage of the Lord\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"41863\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 41863)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(41863)\">Ps. 127:3<\/a><\/span>).\n<\/p><p>\nThat lesson has lingered with me. Among the many things we have learned from our children,\nthis, perhaps, has been the most tempering.\n<\/p><p>\nMuch of what I know&mdash;of what it matters that one knows&mdash;I have learned from my children.\n<\/p><p>\nParenthood is the greatest of educational experiences. Bishop Brown made reference to a\nlesson taught to his 12 year-old son. Were you conscious of the lesson learned by a much\nolder Bishop Brown?\n<\/p><p>\nOur children and the children and youth in the Church are great teachers. Let me relate two\nlessons.\n<\/p><p>\nIn the days of the pioneer settlements, it was not uncommon to have a ward marshal whose\nassignment it was, under the direction of the bishop, to maintain orderly conduct among the\nteenagers.\n<\/p><p>\nOn a Sunday evening after sacrament meeting, the ward marshal at the little settlement of\nCorinne came upon a buggy with some teenagers. Since it was his responsibility to check on\nthe young people, he stealthily crept near the buggy to see just what was going on. He\nmanaged to reach a rather insufficient tree very close to the buggy just as the moon came out.\nHe had to stand more or less at attention to keep from being seen, but he could easily hear all\nthat was transpiring in the buggy.\n<\/p><p>\nLater, in reporting it to the bishop, he told of what had gone on. There had been some jokes\ntold, much laughter, and the usual teenage chatter. He said they sang several songs. The\nbishop interrupted his report with the question, \"Well, was there anything out of order in that\nsituation?\" His answer, \"Yes! me behind that blamed tree.\"\n<\/p><p>\nAlways our youth are teaching those of us who are older, and they teach serious, sacred\nlessons, too.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>\"When do I die?\"<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nPresident Joseph T. Bentley presided over the Mexican Mission. I recall hearing him tell an\nincident that happened, I think, somewhere in Mexico. An 11-year-old boy had been seriously\ninjured in an automobile accident. By the time they got him to the doctor, he was dying from\nloss of blood. In looking for a donor for an emergency transfusion, the doctor decided on the\nboy's seven-year-old sister. He explained to the little girl that her brother was dying and\nasked whether she would be willing to donate her blood in order to save his life. The little\ngirl turned pale with fright, but  a moment she consented to do it.\n<\/p><p>\nThe transfusion was made, and the doctor came to the little girl. \"The color is coming back\ninto his face,\" he said. \"It looks as though he is going to be all right.\" She was happy her\nbrother would be all right, but said, \"But doctor, when am I going to die?\" She had thought\nall the time that she was not just giving her blood but literally her life to save an older\nbrother. We learn great lessons from our youth.\n<\/p><p>\nWith parenthood such a glorious experience, how important it is that we have reverence for it.\n<\/p><p>\nFrequently I receive letters and not infrequently young couples come, particularly of college\nage, struggling to achieve advanced degrees, and they ask for counsel on the coming of\nchildren in their lives.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Planned parenthood<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\n<i>Never<\/i> has a generation been so surrounded with those who speak irreverently of life. <i>Never<\/i>\nhas there been such persuasion to avoid responsibilities of parenthood. <i>Never<\/i> has it been so\nconvenient to block that frail footpath of life across which new spirits enter mortality.\n<\/p><p>\nSeveral years ago, while representing the Church at the University of Montana, I found\nmyself on a panel with representatives from several churches. The moderator asked each of us\nto respond to the question, \"Do you believe in planned parenthood?\" My answer was a\nresounding \"yes!\" with this explanation: We <i>plan<\/i> to have families.\n<\/p><p>\nOften when young couples come, they ask the specific question, \"How many children should\nwe plan to have?\" This I cannot answer, for it is not within my province to know. With some\npersons there are no restrictions of health and perhaps a number of children will be born into\nthe family. Some good parents who would have large families are blessed with but one or two\nchildren. And, occasionally, couples who make wonderful parents are not able to have natural\noffspring and enjoy the marvelous experience of fostering children born to others. Planned\nparenthood involves a good deal more than just the begetting of children. Nothing in our lives\ndeserves more planning than our responsibilities in parenthood.\n<\/p><p>\nI am concerned because our young couples are often in a quandary, particularly when the\narbitrary limiting of families is represented as an act of social good.\n<\/p><p>\nIn this generation we find the indiscriminate marketing of products. Medical advancements\nwith the potential to sustain life and to extend it for the infirm are advertised&mdash;even among\nour unmarried youth&mdash;as agents to prevent life and to extinguish it.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung couples are continually told that parenthood means forfeiture of advanced degrees and\nlimiting of occupational progress, a representation they will live to know is false.\n<\/p><p>\n<b>Approach parenthood with reverence<\/b>\n<\/p><p>\nWhether you will be blessed with many children or but a few, or perhaps experience\nparenthood through the raising of little ones left homeless, is a matter that will be made\nknown as your life unfolds. But I urge you, I warn you to approach parenthood with\nreverence. When you covenant in marriage and are free to act in the creation of life, when\nyou stand at the threshold of parenthood, know that you stand on holy ground. Recognize also\nthat in those areas of greatest opportunity lie the snares of persistent temptation.\n<\/p><p>\nWe are grateful for our family, grateful for all of our children. We have learned so much\nfrom them, some of the things we weren't conscious that we wanted to know. Each of them is\nneeded and wanted in our family; and I say again, much of what I know, of that which\nmatters that one knows, I have learned from our children.\n<\/p><p>\nYoung couples, draw reverently close to your Father in heaven in these monumental decisions\nof life. Seek inspiration from the teachings of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Grow close to him.\nPerhaps you, as he, will come to \"suffer the little children to come unto [you], and forbid\nthem not: for of such is the kingdom of God\" (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"33186\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 33186)\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(33186)\">Mark 10:14<\/a><\/span>). In the name of Jesus Christ.\nAmen.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"}
