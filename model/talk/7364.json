I received a strong witness that we, His daughters, need to know that He loves us. We need to know that He sees the good in us. Feeling His love encourages us to press forward, reassures us that we are His, and confirms to us that He cherishes us even when we stumble and experience temporary setbacks.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p7\" class=\"\">I had this message confirmed when I bore my testimony in the Sunday afternoon session of general conference in April of 2002. That morning I was told that Elder David B. Haight might not be able to participate in the conference. If that happened, I would have five minutes to bear my testimony. I prayed extra hard for Elder Haight that day! Sunday morning I watched him come into the Conference Center, and I started to relax\u2014right up until the moment he exited during the congregational hymn. As I stood at the podium that afternoon, the teleprompter screen was blank! But the message that kept coming to my mind and heart was that women need to feel the Lord\u2019s love in their lives daily. It was the message I knew I needed to convey that day, and it continues to be our message.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p8\" class=\"\">I have been humbled by your tender personal responses to this charge. Thank you for sharing how this message has blessed your life.

All that we do in Relief Society should reflect the love of our Savior and the love of our Heavenly Father. This great love should be the source of our motivation to serve others. It must be both our point of origin and our destination!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p11\" class=\"\">I know of a young mother with five little children who called an older sister, her valued mentor, and asked, \u201cCan we go on a hike?\u201d Her friend knew that meant she needed to talk. Halfway through an eight-mile loop, the young mother finally said, \u201cI just can\u2019t believe that Heavenly Father loves me; I\u2019ve made lots of mistakes in my life. I can\u2019t feel that I\u2019m worthy of His love; how can He possibly love me?\u201d Sisters, this was a woman who had made temple covenants and was active in the Church. And yet she still felt unworthy of His love. The older sister quickly responded, \u201cOf course He loves you. You\u2019re His daughter.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p12\" class=\"\">Do we frequently reject the Lord\u2019s love that He pours out upon us in much more abundance than we are willing to receive?

Think of a mother with her newborn baby. The warmth, safety, cherishing, and peace of a mother\u2019s embrace can help us understand what it feels like to be encircled in the arms of His love. A young adult Relief Society sister wrote, \u201cOnly in the love of my mother do I come close to understanding the magnitude and power of the love of the Savior.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p14\" class=\"\">Mothers, can you see how essential you are in teaching this truth to your children?

I was touched by the comments a daughter shared at the funeral of her 100-year-old mother: \u201cWhen I was a teenager trying to plan my class schedule, I would come into the kitchen where Mother was ironing. I would present possible options for my studies. \u2026 She would listen to all of them. We would discuss the possibilities \u2026 and then she would say, \u2018OK, Cathy, have you prayed about it?\u2019 That was kind of embarrassing to me, and I would hesitate and then add, \u2018Do you have to pray about everything?\u2019 She answered simply, \u2018I do.\u2019\u201d<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote4-26911_000_042\">4<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[Personal correspondence.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p16\" class=\"\">This mother listened. She shared her faith in the Lord; she set an example; she shared her expectations for her daughter to return continually to the Lord. As we approach the Lord, we feel His love draw us closer. Mothers, teach your children to always include the Lord in their lives, and help them to recognize His loving influence.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p17\" class=\"\">My mother and I received our patriarchal blessings together. I was 20, and Mother was 49. I will never forget that day\u2014how the patriarch placed his hands on Mother\u2019s head and told her how often her life had been spared through bouts of rheumatic fever, heart disease, and many other illnesses. He recounted her life, enumerating the times she had blessed others. He told her of things the Lord had in store for her and offered guidance as to what she needed to do. I knew my mother\u2019s life, and I listened as this patriarch, who was not acquainted with her, described her life. This experience was a witness to me that God lives, that He loves us, and that He knows us individually. I felt the Lord\u2019s love for my mother\u2014and for me\u2014on that memorable day.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p18\" class=\"\">The greatest evidence of our Savior\u2019s love for us is His Atonement.

When a three-year-old girl was being sassy, her grandmother instructed her, \u201cDon\u2019t talk that way to your grandmother, because we are going to be friends for millions and millions of years.\u201d Isn\u2019t being a grandmother the best? Remember, sisters, love and covenants bind us together as eternal families.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p20\" class=\"\">The Lord\u2019s love is often delivered through others as they respond to promptings of the Spirit. Are we hearing and following those promptings?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p21\" class=\"\">Because of financial struggles, one sister had to move from her beloved home and ward after living there for 22 years. That was painful. Of her first Sunday in her new ward, she said: \u201cI felt very alone, even though I knew a few people. I was one of the first to Relief Society that morning. I sat there and watched the sisters file in and take their seats. They all seemed to need their own row, not just their own seat. They didn\u2019t sit by each other and they didn\u2019t sit by me. I felt like an island.\u201d Sisters, why do we do that to each other?! The sister continued: \u201cThen Lisa came in. Her face lit up when she saw me and she charged over to me, popped down beside me, put her arm around me and gave me a big hug. It\u2019s amazing how much a small gesture like that can mean. Her warmth\u201d\u2014and I would add, her love\u2014\u201cwashed away my loneliness.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p22\" class=\"\">I fear sometimes we see the Lord\u2019s love only in the big events of our lives; we must also see His love in the smallest of things. Don\u2019t underestimate your ability to share His love through a simple, genuine gesture such as sitting next to another sister and making her feel welcome.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p23\" class=\"\">Do <span class=\"emphasis\">you<\/span> feel the Lord\u2019s love in <span class=\"emphasis\">your<\/span> life? How I feel His love may be different from how you experience it. The key is to come to understand how <span class=\"emphasis\">you<\/span> feel that love. And once you\u2019ve felt it, be willing to share it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p24\" class=\"\">As a presidency we visited the devastated Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina. One evening at a fireside I stood at the pulpit and felt prompted that every sister in attendance needed someone to literally reach out and strengthen her. After the meeting, Sister Hughes, Sister Pingree, and I each stood by a different door and hugged every sister as she exited. We simply wanted to express our love for them. To any of those sisters who are listening tonight, we left your chapel feeling renewed because of the love of God that you shared with us. Thank you for taking care of each other\u2014and the three of us!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p25\" class=\"\">In my morning prayers I ask Heavenly Father to fill me with His love so that I can do His work with more heart. I know that I have been blessed because of this daily petition. As Relief Society sisters, we must strive to manifest the love of Christ, who always sought to please His Father by doing His will. Sisters, we must make every effort to follow His supreme example\u2014to demonstrate such love through our thoughts, our speech, our actions\u2014in all the things we do and are. We must not allow pride or vanity, selfishness or personal agendas to displace our reaching out to others in love. Quite simply and profoundly, we must first allow ourselves to be encircled by God\u2019s love. We do this best by embracing the Savior\u2019s eternal Atonement. Then we can expand that circle to include our family and all others. Such a circle is indeed heaven.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2006\/11\/eternally-encircled-in-his-love.p26\" class=\"\">My dear sisters, may the Lord bless you to feel His love daily as you keep your covenants, exercise charity, and strengthen families.
