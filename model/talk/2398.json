His influence is fading. Presiding responsibilities formerly assumed are left either to the mother or to agencies outside the home. This diminishing role is at the root of a multitude of our problems. Numerous things go awry when the scriptural family organization is upset!<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p4\" class=\"\">The father is the patriarch in the home. This means that the father is the presiding authority. This does not mean that he should be dictatorial. Modern scriptures set forth qualifications for all who preside:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p5\" class=\"\">\u201cNo power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned. \u2026\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"16200\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16200)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16200)\">D&amp;C 121:41<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p6\" class=\"\">In reality, each family is a dominion within itself. Father heads that government. In the beginning it was the only government on the earth and was passed down from Adam to his descendants. Properly organized in the Church, the father is the patriarch of an eternal family unit. Heaven, to us, will be simply an extension of an ideal home. As the presiding priesthood officer, the father fills an irreplaceable role.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p7\" class=\"\">A worthy father who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood should be encouraged to name and bless his children. He should administer to the sick in his home. The father may baptize, confirm, and ordain his children, at the invitation of his file leader in the Church. He may give a father\u2019s blessing. President Joseph Fielding Smith has said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p8\" class=\"\">\u201c<span class=\"emphasis\">A faithful father who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood may bless his own children, and that would be a patriarchal (father\u2019s) blessing. <\/span>Such blessing could be recorded in the family records, but it would not be preserved in the archives of the Church. \u2026 in addition, children may receive a blessing by an <span class=\"emphasis\">ordained patriarch. <\/span>A father blessing his own child could, if he received the inspiration to do so, declare the lineage of the child. As the Patriarch of his home, a father is also a revelator to his family \u2026 and, \u2026 in this sense stands in line to receive the revelations from the Lord for the good and blessing of that family.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Doctrines of Salvation, <\/span>3:172.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p9\" class=\"\">The father exercises his spiritual leadership in the home by calling his family to prayer each morning and evening. Weekly family home evening, likewise, is called and presided over by the father, though all others participate.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p10\" class=\"\">The father is the protector of the home. He guards it against the intrusion of evil from without. Formerly he protected his home with weapons and shuttered windows. Today the task is more complex. Barred doors and windows protect only against the intrusion of a corporeal creature. It is not an easy thing to protect one\u2019s family against intrusions of evil into the minds and spirits of family members. These influences can and do flow freely into the home. Satan can subtly beguile the children of men in ways we have already mentioned in this conference. He need not break down the door.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p11\" class=\"\">Fathers, you will have to live close to the Lord. Develop a sensitivity to the impressions of the Spirit.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p12\" class=\"\">There is yet another intrusion into the home that needs to be mentioned. It is an unwise father who carries to his family his daily business cares. They disturb the peace existing there. He should leave his worries at the office and enter his home with the spirit of peace in his heart and with the love of God burning within him. If there is friction, his presence should soothe it. If there is turmoil, he should resolve it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p13\" class=\"\">I have a friend, a businessman in this city, who does special ordinance work in the temple. One day I passed him on the street and asked where he was going. \u201cI\u2019m going to the temple. Inside those thick walls, in the quiet serenity of that lovely building,\u201d he said, \u201cI find peace.\u201d Then he added, \u201cThere is only one other place in the world where I can find peace\u2014in my own home.\u201d What a compliment to his wife! What a compliment to his children! What a credit to him. This should be the ideal for all fathers\u2014to so live that we can find peace in our homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p14\" class=\"\">Fathers, draw close to your children. Learn to communicate. Learn to listen. This means giving a father\u2019s most valuable commodity\u2014time! Only good results occur when a father interviews his sons and daughters regularly. He can know their problems and their hopes. He can align himself with them as their unconditional friend. To the extent we become friends with our children in unconditional love, to that extent we become like our Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p15\" class=\"\">The story is told of an elementary teacher who had students write essays in hopes that it would motivate the fathers to attend a PTA meeting.

If it does go off, the son knows that his parents will be waiting for him and further, he will not have the privilege of going out for two weeks. Follow-through on the agreement between them is the key that creates better understanding.\u201d (\u201cThe Savior, the Priesthood, and You,\u201d Melchizedek Priesthood quorums\u2019 course of study for 1973\u201374, p. 237.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p24\" class=\"\">Someone has said: \u201cThere is no need of searching out your genealogy if you do not know where your children were last night.\u201d Many inspiring suggestions enliven this practical course of study for fathers.

To walk uprightly in the admonition of the Lord requires not only patience and forebearance, but an exercise in constant practice of all the Christian virtues by each family member. Perhaps the Lord knew this when he instituted the family. A man needs the responsibility of a wife and family. He needs the responsibility of being an example of righteousness. There is wisdom in this requirement. This kind of gentle persuasion is needed to keep a father \u201con course\u201d and gently guide him toward perfection.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-role-of-fathers.p29\" class=\"\">In the family relationship, we find our best laboratory in which to practice celestial living.
