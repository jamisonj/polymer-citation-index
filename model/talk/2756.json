With him was a gentleman he had chanced to meet. Seated in the aircraft together, we engaged ourselves in conversation. I asked the gentleman about his present occupation. He informed us that he was a building engineer, presently engaged in building a church in one of the larger cities in the state of Texas. He recounted to us some of the frustrating experiences that he and their finance committee had in raising funds from the members of his church; they had tried most everything such as direct solicitations, dinners, bazaars, some games of chance\u2014none of which was very successful.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p5\" class=\"\">To solve the financial problem, they called a special meeting. It was during this meeting, he said, that they had come upon a capital idea, after someone had suggested going to the scriptures to try the Lord\u2019s way. The scripture came from Malachi:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p6\" class=\"\">\u201cBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"32841\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 32841)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(32841)\">Mal. 3:10<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p7\" class=\"\">From this the committee conceived a unique idea of getting that message to their members by coining a pocket piece made of copper with a coating to make it appear as a bright gold coin, about the size of a fifty-cent piece, inscribed on one side with the words, \u201cOne tenth is the Lord\u2019s\u201d and on the other side, \u201cBring ye all the tithes and I will pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p8\" class=\"\">These coins, he said, were distributed to the members. The thought was that as the men would reach into their pockets and the ladies into their purses for change, the bright gold coin would be the first item they would see, and it would remind them of their duty. He smiled and handed to each of us the souvenir coin and said: \u201cThis was successful! The people have responded and now we are moving ahead with our project.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p9\" class=\"\">As he said that, I thought, \u201cA true principle discovered, properly applied, brings a correct result.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p10\" class=\"\">After some pause, he turned the conversation to us and queried of us as to our present endeavors, to which we replied: \u201cCoincidentally, we too are engaged in building churches, employed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p11\" class=\"\">\u201cHow many churches are you building?\u201d he asked.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p12\" class=\"\">\u201cAt present, a few hundred,\u201d was the reply.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p13\" class=\"\">A surprised look appeared on his face. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of buildings! How in the world do you pay for them? Where do you get the money?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p14\" class=\"\">\u201cFrom our Church membership, and coincidentally again, the great secret you discovered in the principle of tithing has been a tenet of the Lord\u2019s Church from the early days of its restoration,\u201d was the reply.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p15\" class=\"\">This afforded an extensive discussion of the great devotion of the Latter-day Saints, not only in paying their tithing, their fast offerings, additional construction funds, temple funds, welfare funds, budgets, missionary funds, etc., but also of their giving much of their free time in Church services, in the administration of and participation in the Church programs. We explained the extensive missionary program and the devotion of our young people to it. He seemed intensely interested, sat back in his seat, and thoughtfully said: \u201cThat\u2019s amazing! You must have something we do not have.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p16\" class=\"\">Again the question arises, what really is the difference that causes such devotion? Let us go to Joseph Smith for an answer. In December 1839 he was in Washington in company with others trying to obtain redress of grievances for the Saints. In corresponding with his brother Hyrum, he stated that they had had an interview with the president of the United States and reported, and I quote: \u201cIn our interview with the President, he interrogated us wherein we differed in our religion from other religions of the day. Brother Joseph said we differed in mode of baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. We considered that all other considerations were contained in the gift of the Holy Ghost.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,<\/span> 4:42.) That is the gift conveyed to each member as he is confirmed into the Church. Those who respond to that gift are guided by it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p17\" class=\"\">The power of the Holy Ghost was alluded to in the Savior\u2019s instructions to his disciples as he spoke to them:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p18\" class=\"\">\u201cNevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p19\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment. \u2026<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p20\" class=\"\">\u201cI have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p21\" class=\"\">\u201cHowbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28898\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28898)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28898)\">John 16:7\u20138, 12\u201313<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p22\" class=\"\">It is through the Holy Ghost that members receive the knowledge and witness of the truth. So influenced, they willingly and voluntarily support the cause of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Whatever is required of them, they respond and feel comfortable about it. How else should it be? The price is paid, as portrayed in the simple parable:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p23\" class=\"\">\u201cAgain, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p24\" class=\"\">\u201cWho, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36450\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36450)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36450)\">Matt. 13:45\u201346<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p25\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith, speaking on the subject, so expressed himself: \u201cSuch was, and always will be, the situation of the saints of God, that unless they have an actual knowledge that the course they are pursuing is according to the will of God they will grow weary in their minds, and faint, for such has been, and always will be, the opposition in the hearts of unbelievers and those that know not God. \u2026 For a man to lay down his all \u2026 requires more than mere belief or supposition that he is doing the will of God; but actual knowledge, realizing that, when these sufferings are ended, he will enter into eternal rest, and be a partaker of the glory of God. \u2026 Let us here observe,\u201d he continues, \u201cthat a religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Lectures on Faith,<\/span> 6:4\u20135, 7.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p26\" class=\"\">From certain vantage points, some are privileged to see the growth and vitality of the living Church. In that movement it is seen that faith is increasing in the earth, that God\u2019s everlasting covenant is established, and that the fulness of the gospel is being proclaimed. (See <span class=\"citation\" id=\"16596\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 16596)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(16596)\">D&amp;C 1:21<\/a><\/span>.) This is in harmony with the revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, while spending some of his most burdensome times in the Liberty Jail during the winter and spring of 1838\u201339. In the midst of that dark world he declared:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p27\" class=\"\">\u201cHow long can rolling waters remain impure?

In the prayer Jesus offered in behalf of his disciples and all believers, he said:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p29\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"28901\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 28901)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(28901)\">John 17:3<\/a><\/span>.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1976\/05\/you-are-your-greatest-treasure.p30\" class=\"\">The whole purpose of the gospel plan is to inform mankind that they might act in accord with its principles; it is to help the individual find himself, to bring into his life an answer to his dilemmas.

If you can get yourself determined upon\u2014find out what you are and what you are for, and if you can discover and develop the elements of value in your nature\u2014your life will take on the beauty of orderliness. \u2026 I say \u2018if you can,\u2019 for this procedure takes wisdom, and wisdom is a fruit that ripens slowly. Perhaps you are not yet wise, perhaps you are still incapable of self-analysis, perhaps you are confused amid the surface and appearances of life, perhaps your code of conduct is based on the custom of the times and the sayings of alleged sages, perhaps you are disheartened and discouraged, even in frenzy of retreat before the things in your life which seem to oppose you and beat you back.
