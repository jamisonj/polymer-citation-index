He brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and power of God. He was the means of having it published in his own day on two continents. He sent the everlasting gospel, now restored, to the four quarters of the earth.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p6\" class=\"\">He received numerous revelations from the Lord, which have been published in the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and our Church history. He gathered thousands of Latter-day Saints from abroad to establish a great city at Nauvoo, Illinois, with shops and fertile farms, churches, schools, and a university. He projected the westward migration of the Latter-day Saints and the settlement of the Great Basin, a work carried out later by his legal successor, President Brigham Young.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p7\" class=\"\">He lived great, and he died great, a martyr to the cause of Christ; and, like most of the Lord\u2019s anointed in ancient times, he sealed his mission and his testimony with his life\u2019s blood.

He was foreordained in heaven to this mighty work in latter days. He fulfilled his mission with honor and inspiration, a beacon to all who follow him, giving glory always to God on high, for whom he labored.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p9\" class=\"\">But great as this mighty prophet was, he had but a humble beginning. He was raised as a farm boy, with little formal education.

It is the Book of Mormon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p16\" class=\"\">How did it come about?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p17\" class=\"\">An ancient nation which lived in America actually was destroyed suddenly, just as Isaiah foretold. Its population numbered in the millions. These people once had been righteous and had prophets among them who kept a sacred history engraved on metal plates. Before their final destruction, one of their prophets buried that record in the ground in a stone container for safekeeping. Hence, when this book was found, translated, and published in modern times, that early nation literally spoke out of the ground just as Isaiah said it would.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p18\" class=\"\">How was this book brought forth?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p19\" class=\"\">On the 22nd day of September 1823, near Palmyra, New York, an angel of God revealed its resting place to an eighteen-year-old boy named Joseph Smith, at this time as yet an unlearned, uneducated farm laborer, but now called of God to be His modern prophet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p20\" class=\"\">The book was of metal having the appearance of gold. It consisted of metallic pages as thin as common tin. Each page measured about seven by eight inches, and all were bound together at the back with metal rings which allowed the pages to be turned over easily. The book was about six inches thick. Each page was covered on both sides with ancient writing in small but beautifully engraved characters. The book lay in a stone box which had protected it from the elements for centuries.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p21\" class=\"\">I pause here to ask if at that time there was any known parallel to such a record which could be pointed to for corroboration. The answer is no. There was none. But what of today, now, in 1977? The answer is yes\u2014a resounding yes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p22\" class=\"\">For example, archaeologists have now found the engraved gold and silver records of King Sargon II of Assyria, dating to about 750 <span class=\"small\">B.C.<\/span>, buried in the ground in a stone box. The same thing is true of the gold plates of King Darius, who put Daniel in the lions\u2019 den. Both sets of ancient records have been translated and published.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p23\" class=\"\">Another similar set of metal plates, bound together like a book, has been found in Korea and may be seen in the museum at Seoul, and still another has been found in Italy. So, you see, it was not unusual that ancient records were preserved in this way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p24\" class=\"\">Many stone boxes have been found, especially in Mexico and Central America: Some are small, beautifully engraved and contain jewelry; others are large enough for food storage. The use of stone boxes was common in ancient times.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p25\" class=\"\">But let us consider for a moment the actual translation of this record. Joseph Smith says he did it by the gift and power of God, through the use of the Urim and Thummim. As unlearned as he was at that time in his life, he could have done it in no other way.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p26\" class=\"\">Enemies arose. They sought to destroy not only the Prophet Joseph himself, but also his work. They endeavored at every point to discredit what he did, to vilify and tarnish his innocent name, and to downgrade his work. They would not admit he was a prophet. They did not believe in modern revelation. They would seek only to debase him and abuse and defame him.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p27\" class=\"\">So it was that they sought to take the divine stamp away from his translation of the Book of Mormon. They determined to \u201chumanize\u201d his work by saying that he himself had composed the volume, or that he stole it from Spaulding, or that Sidney Rigdon wrote it, although it was published well before Joseph ever heard of Sidney Rigdon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p28\" class=\"\">In their effort to \u201chumanize\u201d his work of translation they grudgingly gave him credit for knowledge and skills which he did not have, saying that he plagiarized parts of the Bible and literally took whole chapters out of it to compose his Book of Mormon\u2014all of which claims, of course, were untrue and ridiculous.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p29\" class=\"\">Joseph Smith declared that he wrote only under the gift and power of God. Oliver Cowdery, his scribe, said the same thing, adding, \u201cI wrote with my own pen the entire Book of Mormon (save a few pages) as it fell from the lips of the Prophet [Joseph Smith] as he translated it by the gift and power of God.\u201d (\u201cJournal of Reuben Miller,\u201d 21 Oct. 1848.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p30\" class=\"\">Martin Harris, another assistant scribe, bore the same testimony. And Emma Smith, the beloved wife of the prophet, who literally lived in and with and through this translation period, and assisted at times as a scribe, bore this testimony:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cI am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired. For when [I acted] as his scribe, [Joseph] would dictate to me hour after hour; and when returning after meals or after interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him. \u2026 It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this, and for one so \u2026 unlearned as he was, it was simply impossible.\u201d (<span class=\"emphasis\">Saints\u2019 Herald,<\/span> 1879, 26:290.)<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p32\" class=\"\">Then how can critics truthfully say that Joseph Smith, in his youth, was so scholarly that he could or would deliberately take passages from the Bible and skillfully make it appear that they were part of the Book of Mormon manuscript?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p33\" class=\"\">His mother said that at that early point in his life he had not yet even read through the Bible. Then how could he select carefully chosen passages and work them into the Book of Mormon so appropriately and skillfully?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p34\" class=\"\">Not having read through the Bible in his early years, he had no adequate knowledge with which to do such an editing job even if he had been adept at writing or editing, neither of which skills he possessed that early in life.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p35\" class=\"\">The Book of Mormon is a literary and a religious masterpiece, and is far beyond even the fondest hopes or abilities of any farm boy. It is a modern revelation from end to end. It is God-given.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p36\" class=\"\">Read, for example, some of the Savior\u2019s beautiful sermons in that book. Note that the Lord quotes Bible prophets. Are we to say that the unlearned Joseph Smith had the audacity or the skill to rewrite the Savior\u2019s sermons and insert King James Version passages in them, thinking to improve on what Jesus said?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p37\" class=\"\">Are we to believe the specious arguments of those critics who say that Joseph supposed that he could do better than the prophet Mormon? Did he have either the knowledge or the discretion to determine that the King James translators were superior to the prophet Mormon in the preparation of scriptural texts? Where is their sense of reason?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p38\" class=\"\">Mormon was a mature and inspired prophet. Joseph was but an unlearned farm boy. Could Joseph improve on Mormon\u2019s work?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p39\" class=\"\">This young man was faithful to his charge. He did not tamper with the work of Mormon, the sermons of Jesus, the marvelous defense of Abinadi, or the writings of Malachi or Isaiah. He was strictly a translator, not an editor or a composer; nor was he a thief plagiarizing someone else\u2019s work.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p40\" class=\"\">The whole task of translation was a miracle.

It is very simple. When I lived in England a few years ago I went to the British Museum in London and studied the history of the King James Version of the Bible. I learned that its translators fasted and prayed for inspiration in their work. I am convinced that they received it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/11\/it-was-a-miracle.p42\" class=\"\">The similarity in the two books is but a testimony to the accuracy of the King James Version.
