I speak of Louis C. Jacobsen. He ministered to those in need, he assisted the immigrant to find employment, and he delivered more sermons at more funeral services than any other I have known.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p29\" class=\"\">One day while in a reflective mood, Louis Jacobsen told me of his boyhood. He was the son of a poor Danish widow. He was small in stature, not comely in appearance\u2014easily the object of his classmates\u2019 thoughtless jokes. In Sunday School one Sabbath morning, the children made light of his patched trousers and his worn shirt. Too proud to cry, tiny Louis fled from the chapel, stopping at last, out of breath, to sit and rest on the curb which ran along Second West in Salt Lake City. Clear water flowed along the gutter next to the curb where Louis sat. From his pocket he took a piece of paper which contained the outlined Sunday School lesson and skillfully shaped a paper boat, which he launched on the flowing water. From his hurt boyish heart came the determined words, \u201cI\u2019ll never go back.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p30\" class=\"\">Suddenly, through his tears Louis saw reflected in the water the image of a large and well-dressed man. Louis turned his face upward and recognized George Burbidge, the Sunday School superintendent.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p31\" class=\"\">\u201cMay I sit down with you?\u201d asked the kind leader.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p32\" class=\"\">Louis nodded affirmatively. There on the gutter\u2019s curb sat a good Samaritan ministering to one who surely was in need. Several boats were formed and launched while the conversation continued. At last the leader stood and, with a boy\u2019s hand tightly clutching his, they returned to Sunday School.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p33\" class=\"\">Later Louis himself presided over that same Sunday School. Throughout his long life of service, he never failed to acknowledge the traveler who rescued him along a Jericho Road.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p34\" class=\"\">When I first learned of that far-reaching experience, I reflected on the words:<\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"figure\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">He stood at the crossroads all alone,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">The sunlight in his face.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">He had no thought for the world unknown\u2014<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">He was set for a manly race.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">But the roads stretched east and the roads stretched west,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And the lad knew not which road was best.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">So he chose the road that led him down,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And he lost the race and the victor\u2019s crown.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">He was caught at last in an angry snare<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Because no one stood at the crossroads there<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">To show him the better road.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"stanza\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Another day at the self-same place<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">A boy with high hopes stood.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">He, too, was set for a manly race;<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">He, too, was seeking the things that were good.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">But one was there who the roads did know,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And that one showed him which way to go.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">So he turned from the road that would lead him down,<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">And he won the race and the victor\u2019s crown.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">He walks today the highway fair<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">Because one stood at the crossroads there<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"line\" id=\"\">\n\t    <span class=\"emphasis\">To show him the better way.<\/span>\n\t  <\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p57\" class=\"\">May I relate to you my first journey along a personal Jericho Road. In about my tenth year, as Christmas approached, I yearned as only a boy can yearn for an electric train. My desire was not to receive the economical and everywhere-to-be-found wind-up model train, but rather one that operated through the miracle of electricity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p58\" class=\"\">The times were those of economic depression, yet Mother and Dad, through some sacrifice, I am sure, presented to me on Christmas morning a beautiful electric train. For hours I operated the transformer, watching the engine first pull its cars forward, then push them backward around the track.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p59\" class=\"\">Mother entered the living room and said to me that she had purchased a wind-up train for Widow Hansen\u2019s boy, Mark, who lived down the lane. I asked if I could see the train. The engine was short and blocky\u2014not long and sleek like the expensive model I had received.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p60\" class=\"\">However, I did take notice of an oil tanker car which was part of his inexpensive set. My train had no such car, and pangs of envy began to be felt. I put up such a fuss that Mother succumbed to my pleadings and handed me the oil tanker car. She said, \u201cIf you need it more than Mark, you take it.\u201d I put it with my train set and felt pleased with the result.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p61\" class=\"\">Mother and I took the remaining cars and the engine down to Mark Hansen. The young boy was a year or two older than I. He had never anticipated such a gift and was thrilled beyond words. He wound the key in his engine, it not being electric like mine, and was overjoyed as the engine and two cars, plus a caboose, went around the track.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p62\" class=\"\">Mother wisely asked, \u201cWhat do you think of Mark\u2019s train, Tommy?\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p63\" class=\"\">I felt a keen sense of guilt and became very much aware of my selfishness.

She, who with her hand in God\u2019s had entered into the valley of the shadow of death to bring me, her son, across the bridge of life, now took me by the hand and together we returned homeward by way of our private Jericho Road.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p67\" class=\"\">Some remember mother for her rhymes recited, others for her music played, songs sung, favors bestowed, or stories told; but I remember best that day we together traveled our Jericho Road and, like the good Samaritan, found a cherished opportunity to help.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1977\/05\/your-jericho-road.p68\" class=\"\">My brothers and sisters, today there are hearts to gladden, there are deeds to be done\u2014even precious souls to save.
