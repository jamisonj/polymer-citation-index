She served in that calling until she was 84 years old. Sister Fox was born in England, and when she was 13, she walked almost every step to the Salt Lake Valley with a group of pioneers. Her mother died when she was a baby, so she spent the first dozen years of her life living with a number of different families. She must have been a difficult child to manage, because her grandmother called her a \u201cbad maid\u201d and refused to take care of her.<sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote2-00605_000_042\">2<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Janet Peterson and LaRene Gaunt, <span class=\"emphasis\">Keepers of the Flame: Presidents of the Young Women<\/span> (1993), 33\u201334.]<\/span><\/sup><\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remembering-repenting-and-changing.p7\" class=\"\">Eventually, Ruth married and had 12 children.

She was the daughter of faithful pioneer parents who had sacrificed much for the gospel. She had been married in the temple and was the mother of 10 children. She was a talented woman who taught her children how to pray, to work hard, and to love each other. She paid her tithing, and the family rode to church together on Sunday in their wagon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remembering-repenting-and-changing.p11\" class=\"\">Though she knew it was contrary to the Word of Wisdom, she developed the habit of drinking coffee and kept a coffee pot on the back of her stove. She claimed that \u201cthe Lord will not keep me out of heaven for a little cup of coffee.\u201d But, because of that little cup of coffee, she could not qualify for a temple recommend, and neither could those of her children who drank coffee with her. Though she lived to a good old age and did eventually qualify to reenter and serve in the temple, only one of her 10 children had a worthy temple marriage, and a great number of her posterity, which is now in its fifth generation, live outside of the blessings of the restored gospel she believed in and her forefathers sacrificed so much for.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remembering-repenting-and-changing.p12\" class=\"\">The last story is about Christina (not her real name), who had been baptized and sealed to her family when she was a young girl, but somewhere along the way the family stopped living the gospel. Now she was in her late teens, and she had been making some wrong choices and was very unhappy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remembering-repenting-and-changing.p13\" class=\"\">One day I gave her a Personal Progress book and said, \u201cThis book will help you incorporate qualities of Christ in your life so you can make the changes you desire. I invite you to begin to work in your book today and then bring it with you to the youth fireside tonight and share with me what you have learned.\u201d That night she said with tears in her eyes, \u201cToday I started <span class=\"emphasis\">my<\/span> personal progress.\u201d She has written to me a few times since that day. She began going back to Sunday meetings, Mutual, and seminary. In a couple of weeks her sister and mother attended church with her. Later the father joined them, and now the entire family has been back to the temple together.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remembering-repenting-and-changing.p14\" class=\"\">So what were some lessons I learned from these stories about remembering, repenting, and changing?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remembering-repenting-and-changing.p15\" class=\"\"><span class=\"strong\">\n\t  <span class=\"emphasis\">The first lesson is that everyone makes mistakes.<\/span>\n\t<\/span><sup class=\"noteMarker\"><a href=\"#footnote6-00605_000_042\">6<\/a>\n       <span class=\"footnote\">[See Bible Dictionary, \u201cRepentance,\u201d 761.]<\/span><\/sup> Not long ago I was with an eight-year-old girl on the day of her baptism.

I often hear about the chosen, royal generation of this dispensation, but I have never heard it called the perfect generation. Teenagers are especially vulnerable because the power of Satan is real, and they are making their first big, independent choices. Consequently, they are also making their first big mistakes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/2007\/05\/remembering-repenting-and-changing.p16\" class=\"\">This is what happened to Corianton in the Book of Mormon.
