In some cases it is in commodities and in some cases it is in money, cash in lieu. And as these funds come into the Church, then we use them to take care of the needs of the poor throughout the regions of the Church.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p9\" class=\"\">Now, brethren, during the past year we have not taken sufficient into the bishops storehouse to have a full year\u2019s inventory. We have about an eight and a half months\u2019 inventory. This is partially due to the commodity price index rising from .185 on January 1 to .285 on August 1, 1973, on the wholesale index. Now you can see we had to use cash in lieu funds to buy products which are not produced in the storehouse. We used many of these funds for that purpose and this has been a factor in reducing our inventory to eight and a half months. We will build this back to a full year inventory at the end of this year.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p10\" class=\"\">The storehouse is to furnish the food for approximately 3 percent of the Church. Around 96,000 people receive commodities from the storehouse. We have a one-year inventory to supply needs for this 3 percent drawing from the storehouse. Brethren, bishops, those who administer these great funds and commodities, would you recall with me some principles that I think are urgent?<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p11\" class=\"\">For example, in the bishops storehouse we have foods that are going to the homes of our less fortunate Saints. We feel possibly as you deal with these commodities you may need to make some slight adjustments. We feel the best commodities that are produced on our projects should be brought into the storehouses, not the culls from the farm or from the flocks or from the herds of cattle. We think it ought to be the very best, for do we not recall the scripture, \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u201d (<span class=\"citation\" id=\"36245\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"sx(this, 36245)\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"gs(36245)\">Matt. 25:40<\/a><\/span>.) I believe that is a two-edged sword, and if we give to the Lord, or give to these fine Saints who receive from the bishops storehouse the culls, I believe then that we might be dealt with justly by the Lord in a like manner.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p12\" class=\"\">Now there are some principles we also need to understand. One is this: when stake presidents and bishops contribute to the general committee from your projects, would you consider that we must have the very best. For example, we had one stake president in a nearby stake who the central storehouse called and said, \u201cWe need a few head of cattle.\u201d The wholesale index that the Church was working on was a little under that which represented the present market. He said, \u201cNo, we won\u2019t furnish you the cattle. We will sell them and then we will give you the cash in lieu,\u201d which he did. They gave us the cash in lieu, brethren. We had to go out on the wholesale market and buy dressed beef at an up price. Now you think about that. It is all the Lord\u2019s money. I don\u2019t believe he would be pleased with that kind of a transaction. I wouldn\u2019t want to offend anyone. I just think we ought to give the best we have to the Lord\u2019s storehouse.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p13\" class=\"\">I think there is another thing we must consider: have your eating habits changed a little over the past year? Ours have, greatly. We used to eat potatoes regularly, but when they got up to $1.69 for ten pounds, we decided to not eat as much of that product as we used to. We switched to rice. Our meat diet has considerably decreased. Our grocery mix has changed at home. However, we understand that those who are receiving commodities through the storehouse are receiving just as much meat as they were previously. Now we don\u2019t want them to be treated any better or any worse than anyone else in the Church. We just want them to be treated with dignity, and so it might be well for you to adjust that mix a little bit as you are doing in your own homes.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p14\" class=\"\">Let me give you a better example. In the business world every groceryman understands that in a particular section, if you want to raise the gross you don\u2019t have to raise the price. You can raise the gross profit by changing the product mix. A very simple mathematical example will tell you how to do this. Let\u2019s take for example, in one section you had a product markup of zero on 60 percent of your products in that section. Sixty percent times zero is zero. It contributes no gross points to the overall gross mark up. If you had a 20 percent mark up on the remaining 40 percent, 40 percent times 20 equals 8 percent, so you contributed eight gross points to your overall gross in that section.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p15\" class=\"\">Now, brethren, let\u2019s say we reversed things and took those high mark up items at 20 percent and displayed them on the heavy traffic impulse ends where the customers are more likely to buy, and took the low mark up items off those ends and put them on the shelf in a less favorable position, then we change the product mix. Now, say we get 20 percent markup on 60 percent of our gross and 0 percent on 40 percent. We get 40 percent times nothing is still nothing; 60 percent times 20 is 12 gross points, so we have increased our gross by four points by just changing the mix without having raised the price.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p16\" class=\"\">Brethren, that is a great principle in welfare. Our home food bill is no more than it was six months ago or a year ago. We had to change the mix. We feel, bishops, you might well change the mix on those who are eating out of your bishops storehouse. When potatoes are $1.69 for ten pounds, let\u2019s switch to rice. When meat is as high as it is, let\u2019s not do as one bishop did, continue to give one family 67 pounds of beef each month. I don\u2019t know that there are too many families here that are eating 67 pounds of beef each month. Those Saints receiving commodities through the bishops storehouse should not be receiving more than you are using in your homes. I hope this is a principle that we will remember and use very wisely.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p17\" class=\"\">Now to those who raise beef and potatoes, please don\u2019t be disenchanted with the Church. This is just Vaughn Featherstone speaking, not the prophet. We are trying to spend the Lord\u2019s sacred funds in the best possible way.

I didn\u2019t dare not come on that next Thursday.

There are as many ways of mowing a lawn as there are people, and they may be worth anywhere from a penny to five dollars. Let\u2019s say that a three-dollar job would be just what you have done today, except that you\u2019d have to be something of a fool to spend that much time on a lawn. A five-dollar lawn is\u2014well, it\u2019s impossible, so we\u2019ll forget about that.

The more I became more acquainted with her lawn, places where the ground was a little high or a little low, places where it needed to be clipped short or left long on the edges to make a more satisfying curve along the garden, the more I became aware of just what a four-dollar lawn would consist of. And each week I would resolve to do just that kind of a job. But by the time I had made my three dollar or three and-a-half dollar mark I was too tired to remember even having had the ambition to go beyond that.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p77\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018You look like a good consistent $3.50 man,\u2019 she would say as she handed me the money.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p78\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018I guess so\u2019 I would say, too happy at the sight of the money to remember that I had shot for something higher.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p79\" class=\"\">\u201c\u2018Well, don\u2019t feel too bad,\u2019 she would comfort me. \u2018After all, there are only a handful of people in the world who could do a four-dollar job.\u2019<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p80\" class=\"\">\u201cAnd her words <span class=\"emphasis\">were <\/span>a comfort at first, but then, without my noticing what was happening, her comfort became an irritant that made me resolve to do that four-dollar job, even if it killed me. In the fever of my resolve, I could see myself expiring on her lawn, with the Countess leaning over me, handing me the four dollars with a tear in her eye, begging my forgiveness for having thought I couldn\u2019t do it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p81\" class=\"\">\u201cIt was in the middle of such a fever, one Thursday night when I was trying to forget the day\u2019s defeat and get some sleep, that the truth hit me so hard that I sat upright, half choking in my excitement. It was the <span class=\"emphasis\">five-dollar <\/span>job I had to do, not the four-dollar one! I had to do the job that no one could do because it was impossible.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p82\" class=\"\">\u201cI was well acquainted with the difficulties ahead. I had the problem, for example, of doing something about the worm mounds in the lawn. The Countess might not even have noticed them yet, they were so small; but in my bare feet I knew about them and I had to do something about them. And I could go on trimming the garden edges with shears, but I knew that a five-dollar lawn demanded that I line up each edge exactly with a yard stick and then trim it precisely with the edger. And there were other problems that only I and my bare feet knew about.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p83\" class=\"\">\u201cI started the next Thursday by ironing out the worm mounds with a heavy roller. After two hours of that I was ready to give up for the day. Nine o\u2019clock in the morning, and my will was already gone! It was only by accident that I discovered how to regain it. Sitting under a walnut tree for a few minutes after finishing the rolling, I fell asleep. When I woke up minutes later, the lawn looked so good and felt so good under my feet, I was anxious to get on with the job.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p84\" class=\"\">\u201cI followed this secret for the rest of the day, dozing for a few minutes every hour to regain my perspective and replenish my strength. Between naps, I mowed four times, two times lengthwise, two times across, until the lawn looked like a green velvet checkerboard. Then I dug around every tree, crumbling the big clods and smoothing the soil with my hands, then finished with the edger, meticulously lining up each stroke so that the effect would be perfectly symmetrical. And I carefully trimmed the grass between the flagstones of the front walk. The shears wore my fingers raw, but the walk never looked better.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<p uri=\"\/ensign\/1974\/01\/the-gospel-of-jesus-christ-is-the-golden-door.p85\" class=\"\">\u201cFinally about eight o\u2019clock that evening \u2026 it was all completed.
